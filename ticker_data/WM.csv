823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2009. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2009 Overview In our outlook for 2009, we communicated our belief that we would be well positioned to weather the challenges presented by the current economic environment. We also noted that we would focus our efforts on ensuring we are operating efficiently and generating strong and consistent free cash flows. When reviewing our 2009 financial results, we believe that our focus throughout the year on (i) maintaining our pricing discipline; (ii) controlling our costs and reducing discretionary spending; and (iii) ensuring that our cost structure is flexible enough to respond to volume changes in a timely manner has enabled us to produce solid results in a difficult environment. During 2009, our most significant challenges included (i) reduced volumes due to an overall decrease in waste produced that can be attributed to sharp declines in residential and commercial construction and in consumer and business spending; (ii) an unusually weak recyclable commodities market for most of the year; and (iii) decreases in market prices for electricity, which affect the yield of our waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Against this backdrop, we believe that our 2009 results of operations reflected the resilience of our core business and the opportunities that economic recovery will present for our more efficient organization. The highlights of our 2009 financial results include: • Revenues of $11.8 billion and internal revenue growth from yield from collection and disposal operations of 2.9%; • Income from operations of $1.9 billion and income from operations as a percentage of revenue of 16.0%, in spite of the recognition of $83 million of non-cash impairment charges, which were primarily a result of (i) our decision to abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system; and (ii) a change in expectations for the future operations of a landfill in California; • Effective tax rate of 28.1% due principally to the favorable impacts of fourth quarter adjustments to our provision for income taxes related to the carry-back of a capital loss, recognition of state net operating losses and tax credits, and revaluation of deferred taxes due to Canadian tax rate reductions; • Diluted earnings per share of $2.01; and • Cash flow generated from operating activities of $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. In February 2009, we announced that we were consolidating our 45 Market Areas into 25 Areas to further streamline our operations, and throughout 2009 we incurred $50 million of restructuring costs related to these efforts. The restructuring was a result of our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations. In 2009, we exceeded our expected cost savings of $120 million on an annualized basis due to the restructuring. Although one of our most significant focuses throughout 2009 was on controlling costs, there are areas in which we have purposefully increased spending, as we believe that the long-term benefits we will achieve outweigh their negative short-term effect on our costs and margins. These include professional fees related to expansion projects, acquisitions and the growth of new business lines. We also have not cut back on spending for information technology, which we believe is imperative to enable our employees to perform efficiently. Liquidity and Cash Flow — Although the credit markets came to an unprecedented standstill in late 2008, in February 2009 we were able to issue an aggregate of $800 million of senior notes. The proceeds of this debt issuance were primarily used to refinance debt maturities, which is generally consistent with our practice. The state of the credit markets in late 2009 allowed us, in large part because of our investment grade credit rating and strong balance sheet, to issue an additional $600 million of 30-year senior notes at an interest rate of 6.125%. We believe that the decision to raise capital on such favorable terms was a prudent decision, and will increase our flexibility in 22 Table of Contents pursuing acquisitions and investments in businesses when opportunities arise. Even with the increased indebtedness, we are well within our debt to capitalization goals and all of our financial covenant requirements. However, the increased indebtedness is expected to increase our interest expense in 2010. As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. We believe free cash flow gives investors insight into our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. However, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt maturities. We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in millions), which may not be the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,362 $ 2,575 Capital expenditures (1,179 ) (1,221 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets 28 112 Free cash flow $ 1,211 $ 1,466 The decrease in our free cash flow in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due, in large part, to the decline in operating cash flows. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities can generally be attributed to the economy and market conditions, the impacts of which are discussed in detail throughout the remainder of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Decreased proceeds from divestitures on a year-over-year basis also contributed to the decline, due in large part to us having fewer underperforming operations to sell. Our ability to generate over $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2009 enabled us to return $795 million to stockholders during the year through the payment of $569 million in cash dividends and the repurchase of $226 million of our common stock. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information Fair Value Measurements — In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements. This guidance defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the guidance for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance for non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis effective January 1, 2009. The application of the fair value framework did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Business Combinations — In December 2007, the FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements related to business combinations. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that relate to business combinations completed before January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Further, business combinations completed in 2009, which are discussed in Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, have not been material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent that future business combinations are material, our adoption of the FASB’s revised authoritative guidance associated with business combinations may significantly impact our 23 Table of Contents accounting and reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result of (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets, liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such amounts can be determined and (ii) the requirement that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented, have resulted in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial information and the remeasurement of our 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates, which are discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position. Reclassification of Segment Information — During the first quarter of 2009, we transferred responsibility for the oversight of day-to-day recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our four geographic Groups. We believe that, by integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with the remainder of our solid waste business, we can more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers and ensure that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis. As a result of this operational change, we also changed the way we review the financial results of our geographic Groups. Beginning in 2009, the financial results of our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities are included as a component of their respective geographic Group and the financial results of our recycling brokerage business and electronics recycling services are included as part of our “Other” operations. We have reflected the impact of these changes for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our geographic Group operations. Refer to Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our reportable segments. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and 24 Table of Contents other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field- 25 Table of Contents based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 39 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2009, 14 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Nine of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining five landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. 26 Table of Contents Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset; (ii) actual third-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable occurred. These events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators. There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our operating segments. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating segment’s cash flows to estimate their fair value. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our operating segments. 27 Table of Contents The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired. Self-Insurance Reserves and Recoveries We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents differ significantly from our assumptions. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues in 2009 were $11.8 billion, compared with $13.4 billion in 2008 and $13.3 billion in 2007. We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western Groups, and our Wheelabrator Group, which includes our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs. These five Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Eastern $ 2,960 $ 3,319 $ 3,411 Midwest 2,855 3,267 3,289 Southern 3,328 3,740 3,737 Western 3,125 3,387 3,444 Wheelabrator 841 912 868 Other 628 897 832 Intercompany (1,946 ) (2,134 ) (2,271 ) Total $ 11,791 $ 13,388 $ 13,310 Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and waste-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the MRF or disposal facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel. Our waste-to-energy revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator Group, are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam. Our “Other” revenues include our in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy operations, Port-O-Let® services, street and parking lot sweeping services, portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services. 28 Table of Contents Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Collection $ 7,980 $ 8,679 $ 8,714 Landfill 2,547 2,955 3,047 Transfer 1,383 1,589 1,654 Wheelabrator 841 912 868 Recycling 741 1,180 1,135 Other 245 207 163 Intercompany (1,946 ) (2,134 ) (2,271 ) Total $ 11,791 $ 13,388 $ 13,310 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change Change 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 As a % of As a % of Total Total Amount Company(a) Amount Company(a) Average yield(b) $ (528 ) (3.9 )% $ 644 4.9 % Volume (1,078 ) (8.1 ) (557 ) (4.2 ) Internal revenue growth (1,606 ) (12.0 ) 87 0.7 Acquisitions 97 0.7 117 0.9 Divestitures (37 ) (0.2 ) (130 ) (1.0 ) Foreign currency translation (51 ) (0.4 ) 4 — $ (1,597 ) (11.9 )% $ 78 0.6 % (a) Calculated by dividing the amount of current year increase or decrease by the prior year’s total company revenue ($13,388 million and $13,310 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively) adjusted to exclude the impacts of current year divestitures ($37 million and $130 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively). (b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related-business basis: 29 Table of Contents Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change Change 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 As a % of As a % of Related Related Amount Business(i) Amount Business(i) Average yield: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 321 3.0 % $ 347 3.2 % Waste-to-energy disposal(ii) 2 0.5 3 0.7 Collection and disposal(ii) 323 2.9 350 3.1 Recycling commodities (447 ) (36.3 ) 81 6.9 Electricity(ii) (76 ) (21.3 ) 24 7.1 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees (328 ) (46.5 ) 189 36.5 Total $ (528 ) (3.9 ) $ 644 4.9 (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior-year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year ($37 million and $130 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively). The table below summarizes the related business revenues for each year, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures: Denominator 2009 2008 Related business revenues: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 10,622 $ 10,715 Waste-to-energy disposal 434 431 Collection and disposal 11,056 11,146 Recycling commodities 1,233 1,180 Electricity 356 336 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 706 518 Total Company $ 13,351 $ 13,180 (ii) Average revenue growth from yield from “Collection and disposal” excludes all electricity-related revenues generated by our Wheelabrator Group, which are reported as “Electricity” revenues. Before 2009, we reported electricity-related revenues from Wheelabrator’s IPPs as “Electricity” and electricity-related revenues from Wheelabrator’s waste-to-energy facilities in “Waste-to-energy.” Beginning in 2009, all of Wheelabrator’s electricity-related revenues are included in “Electricity” and only the disposal revenues are included in “Waste-to-energy disposal.” We have reflected the impact of this change for all years presented to provide information that consistently reflects our current approach. Our revenues decreased $1,597 million, or 11.9%, in 2009 as compared with 2008. A substantial portion of these declines can be attributed to market factors, including (i) recyclable commodity prices; (ii) lower fuel prices, which reduced revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program; (iii) the effect of lower electricity prices on our waste-to-energy business; and (iv) foreign currency translation on revenues from our Canadian operations. In addition, revenues continue to decline due to lower volumes, which have resulted from the slowdown in the economy. In 2009, economic pressures continued to significantly reduce consumer and business spending, which meant less waste was being generated. However, our revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations was $323 million in 2009 which demonstrates our commitment to pricing even in the current economic environment. Towards the end of 2009, we began to see the trend of volume decline moderate. For the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenue decline was $102 million, or 3.3% as compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This improvement, as 30 Table of Contents compared with our full-year revenue decline of 11.9%, is primarily driven by the steady commodity price recovery trend that occurred throughout 2009 as compared with the severe decline in commodity pricing and demand in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see our year-over-year volume comparisons improve in our collection and disposal businesses. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. In both 2009 and 2008, the increases in revenues from yield were driven by our collection operations, which experienced substantial yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic operating group, primarily as a result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives, including various fee increases. As discussed below, increased collection revenues due to pricing have been more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes. However, increased revenue growth from yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs has consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business. In addition to the revenue growth from yield in the collection line of business, we experienced increases in revenues from yield at our landfills and our transfer stations due to our continued focus on pricing activities. Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in average yield on collection and disposal, increased by $37 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Environmental fee revenues totaled $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $181 million in 2008 and $121 million in 2007. Recycling commodities — For the first nine months of 2008, record high commodity prices favorably impacted our revenue growth. Then, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we saw a rapid decline in commodity prices due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally. Commodity demand and prices continued to be weak in the first nine months of 2009 as compared with record-high commodity prices experienced through September of 2008. However, market prices for recyclable commodities are recovering and prices have increased significantly from the record lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009. While commodity prices are still significantly less than the levels seen in 2007 and the first nine months of 2008, the current price recovery trend contributed to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2009 and is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the coming year. Electricity — The changes in revenue from yield provided by our waste-to-energy business are largely due to fluctuations in rates charged for electricity under our power purchase contracts that generally correlate with natural gas prices in the markets where we operate. In 2009, we experienced a decline of $76 million in revenue from yield at our waste-to-energy facilities due to the falling electricity prices. During 2009, approximately 34% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, which is an increase from 18% during 2008. Our waste-to-energy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility is increasing as more long-term contracts expire. In 2008, we saw an increase of $24 million in revenue from yield provided by our waste-to-energy business. This increase was largely due to annual rate increases for electricity under long-term contracts and favorable energy market pricing. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — Revenue generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased by $328 million and increased by $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fluctuation is directly attributable to the fluctuation in the crude oil index prices we use for our fuel surcharge program. 31 Table of Contents The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — Our collection business accounted for $622 million of the total volume decrease in 2009. Our industrial collection operations experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the United States. Our commercial and residential collection lines of business tend to be more recession resistant than our other lines of business. However, we still experienced some commercial and residential collection volume declines in 2009 that we attribute to the recessionary economic environment, as well as to pricing and competition. In 2009, we also experienced a 16% decline in third-party revenue due to volume at our landfills. This decrease was most significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and construction and demolition waste streams, although municipal solid waste streams at our landfills have also decreased. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. Lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in revenues of $74 million in 2009. These decreases are attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and international demand for recyclables in late 2008. Demand for recyclable commodities has recovered throughout 2009, although it has yet to compare favorably to the levels we experienced in advance of the market shift in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2008, revenue declines due to lower volumes were driven by lower collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer station and third-party disposal volumes. Declines in revenues from volumes in these lines of business were most significantly affected by (i) our focus on improving margins through increased pricing; and (ii) economic conditions, which particularly affected our industrial collection line of business. Revenue declines attributable to lower volumes also affected our recycling operations due to the rapid decline in demand for recyclable commodities experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 Acquisitions and divestitures — Revenues increased $97 million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to acquisitions, principally in the collection, transfer and recycling businesses, although we also made acquisitions starting in 2008 in our “Other” business as we focused on entering new, complementary lines of business. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of $37 million and $130 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and, to a lesser extent, transfer station and recycling operations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2008, revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded revenue declines from divestitures, a trend we had not seen in over two years. This change reflects our shift in focus from divesting underperforming operations to acquiring businesses. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on asset retirement and environmental remediation obligations, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. 32 Table of Contents Our operating expenses decreased by $1,225 million, or 14.5% when comparing 2009 with 2008 and increased $64 million, or 0.8% when comparing 2008 with 2007. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 61.4% in 2009, 63.2% in 2008 and 63.1% in 2007. The changes in our operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 can largely be attributed to the following: Volume declines and divestitures — Throughout 2009 and 2008, we experienced volume declines as a result of (i) the economy; (ii) pricing and competition; and (iii) divestitures. We continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines, and have achieved significant cost savings as a result. These cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below. Changes in market prices for recyclable commodities — Market prices for recyclable commodities declined sharply when comparing 2009 with 2008. This significant decrease in market prices was the driver of the decrease in cost of goods sold during 2009. Market prices for recyclable commodities climbed robustly through most of 2008, achieving levels during the first nine months of 2008 that had not been seen in several years. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the market prices and demand for recyclable commodities declined sharply. The resulting near-historic low prices and reduced demand carried into the first quarter of 2009 and, although prices have steadily increased during 2009, they remained significantly below prior-year levels throughout most of 2009. Fuel price changes — Lower market prices for fuel caused decreases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. On average, diesel fuel prices decreased 35%, from $3.81 per gallon for 2008 to $2.46 per gallon for 2009. Diesel fuel prices varied significantly in 2008, reaching a record-high price of $4.76 per gallon in July and falling to a three-year low of $2.33 per gallon by the end of the year. On average, diesel fuel prices increased 32% in 2008 from $2.88 per gallon in 2007 to $3.81 per gallon. Changes in risk-free interest rates — We recognized $35 million in favorable adjustments during 2009 compared with $33 million in unfavorable adjustments during 2008 and $8 million in unfavorable adjustments during 2007 due to changes in United States Treasury rates, which are used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. Over the course of 2009, the discount rate we use increased from 2.25% to 3.75%. During 2008, the discount rate we use declined from 4.00% to 2.25%. During 2007, the discount rate we use declined from 4.75% to 4.00%. These adjustments have been reflected in the landfill operating costs category in the table below. Canadian exchange rates — When comparing the average exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which decreased our expenses in all operating cost categories. The weakening of the Canadian dollar decreased our total operating expenses by $40 million for 2009 as compared with 2008. Changes in currency exchange rates had very little impact when comparing the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Acquisitions and growth initiatives — In both 2009 and 2008, we have experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and, to a lesser extent, our various growth and business development initiatives. These cost increases have affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2009 Period Change 2008 Period Change 2007 Labor and related benefits $ 2,260 $ (160 ) (6.6 )% $ 2,420 $ 8 0.3 % $ 2,412 Transfer and disposal costs 937 (111 ) (10.6 ) 1,048 (100 ) (8.7 ) 1,148 Maintenance and repairs 1,033 (41 ) (3.8 ) 1,074 (5 ) (0.5 ) 1,079 Subcontractor costs 700 (201 ) (22.3 ) 901 (1 ) (0.1 ) 902 Cost of goods sold 488 (324 ) (39.9 ) 812 43 5.6 769 Fuel 414 (301 ) (42.1 ) 715 134 23.1 581 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 578 (30 ) (4.9 ) 608 6 1.0 602 Landfill operating costs 222 (69 ) (23.7 ) 291 30 11.5 261 Risk management 211 2 1.0 209 (8 ) (3.7 ) 217 Other 398 10 2.6 388 (43 ) (10.0 ) 431 $ 7,241 $ (1,225 ) (14.5 )% $ 8,466 $ 64 0.8 % $ 8,402 The period-to-period changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed below. Labor and related benefits — • When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost declines were generally a result of (i) headcount and overtime reductions related to volume declines; (ii) effects of foreign currency translation; (iii) a benefit from the restructuring we initiated in January of 2009, although most of these savings are reflected in our selling, general and administrative expenses; and (iv) cost savings provided by our operational improvement initiatives. These cost savings have been offset, in part, by higher hourly wages due to merit increases; and (ii) increased accrued bonus expense as our performance against targets established by our annual incentive plans was stronger than it had been in 2008. • When comparing 2008 with 2007, wages increased due to annual merit adjustments, although these higher costs were more than offset by headcount reductions due to operational efficiencies and divestitures. We experienced additional overtime and other labor costs due to severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2008 in our Midwest Group. Our accrued bonus expenses were lower in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plans was not as strong as it had been in 2007. • The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred for the resolution of labor disputes with certain collective bargaining units. Such costs increased our 2009 expense by $9 million and our 2008 expense by $42 million. The costs incurred during 2009 and 2008 were primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. Transfer and disposal costs — During 2009 and 2008, these cost decreases were a result of volume declines and our continued focus on reducing disposal costs associated with our third-party disposal volumes by improving internalization. The 2009 decrease was also partially due to foreign currency translation. Maintenance and repairs — During 2009, these costs declined as a result of volume declines and various fleet initiatives that have favorably affected our maintenance, parts and supplies costs. These decreases have been offset partially by cost increases due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. Subcontractor costs — During 2009, these cost decreases are a result of volume declines, a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign currency translation. Cost of goods sold — The 2009 and 2008 cost changes are principally due to changes in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of changes in market prices for recyclable commodities discussed above and volume declines. 34 Table of Contents Fuel — The cost changes for 2009 and 2008 are a result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel discussed above and volume declines. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — These cost decreases are principally a result of volume declines, although the comparability of the periods presented is also affected by the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group, which reduced these expenses by $18 million during 2007 and $3 million during 2008. Landfill operating costs — The changes in this category for the years presented was primarily driven by the changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. The impacts of these rate changes are discussed above. Risk management — Our consistent risk management costs reflect the success we have had over the last several years in managing these costs, which can be primarily attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. For 2008, the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of workers’ compensation costs and reduced auto and general liability claims for current claim periods. Other — The comparison of these costs has been significantly affected by the following: • In 2009, we had a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our waste-to-energy facilities. • In 2008 and 2007, we had relatively higher gains recognized on the sales of assets due to our focus on identifying and selling under-utilized assets in order to increase our efficiency. • In 2007, our Western Group incurred “Other” operating expenses of $33 million for security, labor, lodging, travel and other costs incurred as a result of labor disruptions in Oakland and Los Angeles, California. • In 2007, we incurred $21 million of lease termination costs associated with the purchase of one of our independent power production plants that had previously been operated through a lease agreement. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2009 Period Change 2008 Period Change 2007 Labor and related benefits $ 775 $ (78 ) (9.1 )% $ 853 $ 18 2.2 % $ 835 Professional fees 167 (1 ) (0.6 ) 168 8 5.0 160 Provision for bad debts 54 (3 ) (5.3 ) 57 8 16.3 49 Other 368 (31 ) (7.8 ) 399 11 2.8 388 $ 1,364 $ (113 ) (7.7 )% $ 1,477 $ 45 3.1 % $ 1,432 Significant changes in our selling, general, and administrative expenses during the reported periods are as summarized below: Labor and related benefits — In 2009, our labor and related benefits costs have declined because we have been realizing benefits associated with our January 2009 restructuring The comparability of our labor and related benefits expenses in 2009 has also been affected by a significant decrease in non-cash compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plans as a result of (i) a decline in the grant-date fair value of our equity awards; (ii) lower performance against established targets for certain awards than in the 35 Table of Contents prior year; and (iii) the reversal of all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it is no longer probable that the targets established for that award will be met. This decrease in non-cash compensation costs was offset, in part, by higher costs associated with our salary deferral plan, the costs of which are directly affected by equity-market conditions. Additionally, contract labor costs incurred for various Corporate support functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008. The 2008 increase in labor and related benefits costs was primarily attributable to (i) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases; (ii) higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an increase in the size of our sales force and our focus on our people and business development initiatives; and (iii) higher non-cash compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plans. Additionally, we also experienced higher insurance and benefit costs. These increases were offset partially by lower bonus expenses accrued in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plan was not as strong as it had been in 2007. Professional fees — In 2009, we experienced a slight decrease in professional fees due primarily to lower consulting fees related to our various strategic initiatives as compared with 2008. This decrease was largely offset by higher legal fees and expenses in 2009. In 2008, our professional fees increased year-over-year due to legal and consulting costs we incurred related to (i) the support of a proposed acquisition in 2008; and (ii) our business development initiatives. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting costs in 2008 related to various strategic initiatives during 2007, including the support and development of the SAP waste and recycling revenue management system, which we discontinued development of in early 2008. Provision for bad debts — The $3 million decline in our provision for bad debts in 2009 can be generally attributed to (i) the decrease in our revenues and accounts receivable due to current economic conditions and market factors; and (ii) our continued focus on the management and collection of our receivables. However, in 2008, our provision for bad debts increased $8 million as the effects of the weakened economy increased collection risks associated with certain customers. Other — During 2009, our costs associated with advertising, meetings, seminars, and travel and entertainment declined as a result of our increased efforts to reduce controllable spending. These lower costs were due in part to the recent restructuring. This decline was offset partially by higher legal expenses. In 2008, we were focusing on our sales, marketing and other initiatives and identifying new customers, which resulted in increases in our advertising costs and travel and entertainment. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. 36 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 779 $ (6 ) (0.8 )% $ 785 $ (11 ) (1.4 )% $ 796 Amortization of landfill airspace 358 (71 ) (16.6 ) 429 (11 ) (2.5 ) 440 Amortization of intangible assets 29 5 20.8 24 1 4.3 23 $ 1,166 $ (72 ) (5.8 )% $ 1,238 $ (21 ) (1.7 )% $ 1,259 In both 2009 and 2008, the decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment is largely due to (i) components of enterprise-wide software becoming fully-depreciated; and (ii) our focus on retiring or selling under-utilized assets. The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2009 and 2008 is largely due to volume declines as a result of (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing program and competition, both of which have significantly reduced our collection volumes; and (iii) the re-direction of waste to third-party disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are working on procuring an expansion permit. The comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $14 million, $3 million and $17 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs. Restructuring In January 2009, we took steps to further streamline our organization by (i) consolidating our Market Areas; (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations with our other solid waste business; and (iii) realigning our Corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently. Our principal operations are managed through our Groups. Each of our four geographic Groups had been further divided into 45 Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the Market Areas were consolidated into 25 Areas. We found that our larger Market Areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in our smaller Market Areas, and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, responsibility for the oversight of day-to-day recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis. This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this restructuring, of which $41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations that we will continue to incur over the remaining lease term for certain operating lease agreements. 37 Table of Contents (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) $ — $ (33 ) $ (59 ) Asset impairments (excluding held-for-sale impairments) 83 4 12 $ 83 $ (29 ) $ (47 ) (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) — The net gains from divestitures during 2008 and 2007 were a result of our focus on selling underperforming businesses. In 2008, these gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our Southern Group; and in 2007, the gains were related to the divestiture of underperforming collection, transfer and recycling operations in our Eastern, Western and Southern Groups. Asset impairments (excluding held-for-sale impairments) — Through December 31, 2008, we had capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of our waste and recycling revenue management system. A significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of the license of SAP’s waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use. After a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts associated with the SAP revenue management system were suspended in 2007. As disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in March 2008, we filed suit against SAP and are currently scheduled for trial in May 2010. During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of a revenue management system that would include the licensed SAP software. Accordingly, after careful consideration of the failures of the SAP software, we determined to abandon any alternative that would include the use of the SAP software. The determination to abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system resulted in a non-cash charge of $51 million, $49 million of which was recognized during the first quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009. We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by the West Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in California as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down our investments in certain portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations. During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge, primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in impairment charges related to two landfills in our Southern Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill. 38 Table of Contents Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Reportable segments: Eastern $ 483 $ (40 ) (7.6 )% $ 523 $ (27 ) (4.9 )% $ 550 Midwest 450 (25 ) (5.3 ) 475 (49 ) (9.4 ) 524 Southern 768 (104 ) (11.9 ) 872 46 5.6 826 Western 521 (91 ) (14.9 ) 612 (6 ) (1.0 ) 618 Wheelabrator 235 (88 ) (27.2 ) 323 31 10.6 292 Other (136 ) (76 ) * (60 ) (22 ) * (38 ) Corporate and other (434 ) 77 (15.1 ) (511 ) 7 (1.4 ) (518 ) Total $ 1,887 $ (347 ) (15.5 )% $ 2,234 $ (20 ) (0.9 )% $ 2,254 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Reportable segments — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic Groups during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009 are summarized below: • During 2009 and 2008, each Group experienced declines in revenues due to lower volumes, resulting in decreased income from operations. The volume declines were generally the result of the significant downturn in the overall economic environment, particularly in our industrial collection line of business, which has been affected by the sharp decline in residential and commercial construction across the United States. • Significantly lower recycling commodity prices in 2009 as compared with 2008 had an unfavorable effect on each of the four geographic Group’s results. During the fourth quarter of 2008, commodity prices dropped sharply from the prices we experienced throughout 2007 and the first nine months of 2008. This decline was a result of a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally. The resulting near-historic low prices and reduced demand carried into 2009 and, although prices have steadily recovered, they remained significantly below the levels of the prior two years. When comparing 2008 to 2007, the significant decline in commodity prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in operating losses that more than offset the increases in operating income generated during the first nine months of 2008. • During 2009, we recorded $50 million of charges associated with our January 2009 restructuring. During 2008 and 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $2 million and $10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the impact of these charges on each of our reportable segments. The negative impact of these factors has been partially offset by the favorable effects of (i) increased revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal business as a result of our pricing strategies, particularly in our collection operations; and (ii) cost savings attributed to our January 2009 restructuring, our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies, and our increased focus on reducing controllable selling, general and administrative expenses, particularly for travel and entertainment during 2009. Other significant items affecting the comparability of each Groups’ results of operations for years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: Eastern — During 2009, the Group recognized (i) an $18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills; and (ii) a $9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in New Jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded, multi-employer pension fund. During 2008, the Group’s operating income was negatively affected by a 39 Table of Contents $14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. The Group’s operating income for 2007 was favorably affected by (i) net divestiture gains of $33 million; and (ii) an $18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter. Midwest — During 2009, the Group’s operating results were favorably affected by a $10 million reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by $44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Included in the labor dispute expenses are $32 million in charges related to the withdrawal of certain of the Group’s bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. In addition, the Group experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, when comparing the average exchange rate for 2009 with 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which decreased the Group’s income from operations. The effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this Group because substantially all of our Canadian operations are managed by our Midwest organization. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparison of 2008 with 2007. Southern — During 2008, the Group’s operating income was favorably affected by $29 million of divestiture gains, offset, in part, by a $3 million landfill impairment charge. During 2007, the Group recorded $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills. These charges were largely offset by gains on divestitures of $11 million. Western — The Group’s 2009 income from operations includes the recognition of an impairment charge of $27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of a landfill in California, which was offset, in part, by the recognition of a $6 million gain associated with the sale of water rights at a landfill. During 2008, the Group recognized a $6 million gain primarily related to the sale of surplus real estate. In 2007, labor disputes negatively affected the Group’s operating results by $37 million, principally as a result of “Operating” expenses incurred for security, deployment and lodging costs for replacement workers. Gains on divestitures of operations were $16 million for 2007. Wheelabrator — The comparability of the Group’s 2009 income from operations with the prior years has been significantly affected by (i) a decline in market prices for electricity, which had a more significant impact on the Group’s results in 2009 due to the expiration of several long-term energy contracts and short-term pricing arrangements; (ii) an increase in costs for international and domestic business development activities; and (iii) an increase in “Operating” expenses of $11 million as a result of a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our waste-to-energy facilities. Exposure to current electricity market prices increased from 18% of total electricity production in 2008 to 34% in 2009. The Group’s exposure to current electricity market price volatility is expected to continue to grow to about 50% by the end of 2010 as several long-term contracts are set to expire next year. The Group’s 2008 operating results were favorably affected by increases in market rates for energy during the second half of 2008, while the Group’s 2007 operating results were unfavorably affected by a $21 million charge for the early termination of a lease agreement. The early termination was due to the Group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: Other — The unfavorable change in 2009 operating results compared with 2008 is largely due to (i) the effect that the previously discussed lower recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities; (ii) an increase in costs being incurred to support the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business; (iii) the unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our landfill-gas-to-energy operations; and (iv) certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. 40 Table of Contents The unfavorable change in operating results in 2008 when compared with 2007 is the result of (i) the unfavorable effect that the previously discussed fourth quarter of 2008 sharp drop in recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities; and (ii) costs being incurred to support our increased focus on the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: • the recognition of $34 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 by our closed sites management group due to increases in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and environmental remediation recovery assets, while in 2008 and 2007, the same group recognized charges to landfill operating costs of $32 million and $8 million, respectively, due to declines in U.S. Treasury rates during those periods; • a significant decline in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in 2009 resulting from workforce reductions associated with the January 2009 restructuring, increased efforts to reduce our controllable spending and lower equity compensation costs; • $51 million of non-cash abandonment charges recognized during 2009 associated with the determination that we would not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of a revenue management system that would include the licensed SAP software; • 2008 cost decreases attributable to lower risk management expenses due to reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for workers’ compensation and auto and general liability claims and lower bonus expense due to relatively weak performance against established targets offset, in part, by costs incurred for a proposed acquisition; • restructuring charges of $9 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2007; and • employee healthcare coverage expenses in the third quarter of 2007 due to unusually high claims activity. Interest Income and Expense — Our interest expense was $426 million in 2009, $455 million in 2008, and $521 million in 2007. Interest income was $13 million in 2009, $19 million in 2008, and $47 million in 2007. The decreases in interest income and expense for the periods presented are primarily attributable to significant declines in market interest rates. Interest expense — Lower market interest rates have increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest expense associated with our tax-exempt bonds and our Canadian Credit Facility. The impacts of each of these items on our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: Interest rate swaps — We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The impacts to interest expense of our interest rate swaps are primarily related to (i) net periodic settlements of current interest on our active interest rate swaps and (ii) the amortization of previously terminated interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense. The following table summarizes the impact of periodic settlements of active swap agreements and the impact of terminated swap agreements on our results of operations (in millions): (Increase) Decrease to Interest Expense Due to Hedge Years Ended December 31, Accounting for Interest Rate Swaps 2009 2008 2007 Periodic settlements of active swap agreements(a) $ 46 $ 8 $ (48 ) Terminated swap agreements(b) 19 42 37 $ 65 $ 50 $ (11 ) (a) These amounts represent the net of our periodic variable-rate interest obligations and the swap counterparties’ fixed-rate interest obligations. Our variable-rate obligations are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR. Three-month LIBOR rates have varied significantly during the reported periods. During 41 Table of Contents 2007, the three-month LIBOR exceeded 5.0% for most of the year, while during 2008 the rate was as high as 4.8% and as low as 1.4% and during 2009 rates were consistently below 1.0% for most of the year. (b) The amortization to interest expense of terminated swap agreements has decreased due to the maturity of certain previously hedged senior notes. In addition, in 2008, this amount included a $10 million net reduction in interest expense associated with the early retirement of $244 million of 8.75% senior notes. At December 31, 2009, $18 million (on a pre-tax basis) of the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense over the next twelve months. Tax-exempt bonds — Certain of our tax-exempt bonds are subject to remarketing processes that result in periodic adjustments to the interest rates of the bonds. As of December 31, 2009, $817 million of our tax-exempt bonds are “variable-rate” instruments and re-price on either a daily or weekly basis. We also have tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that end before the bonds’ scheduled maturities and $387 million of these bonds were re-priced during 2009. These remarketing processes have significantly reduced the weighted average interest rates of our tax-exempt bonds, which decreased from 4.5% at December 31, 2007 to 4.0% at December 31, 2008 and 3.4% at December 31, 2009. Canadian credit facility — Borrowings outstanding under our Canadian Credit Facility have short-term maturities, but are generally renewed at maturity under the terms of the facility, which results in the effective interest rates of the borrowings being reset to reflect current market interest rates. The weighted average interest rates of borrowings outstanding under our Canadian Credit Facility have decreased from 5.3% as of December 31, 2007 to 3.3% as of December 31, 2008 and 1.3% at December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company issued an additional $600 million of senior notes, which mature in 2039 and have a coupon rate of 6.125%. This debt issuance is expected to increase our average debt balances and our interest expense in 2010 as we currently expect to use the proceeds from the issuance to make various acquisitions and investments, rather than as a source for the repayment of existing debt. As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s debt-to-total capital ratio was 57.4%, which continues to be consistent with our targeted long-term debt-to-total capitalization of up to 60%. Interest income — When comparing 2009 with 2008, the decrease in interest income is generally related to the decline in market interest rates, offset, in part, by an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances throughout the year. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents balances exceeded $1 billion, due in large part to our $600 million issuance of senior notes during the fourth quarter 2009. We currently expect to utilize a significant portion of these funds for investments and acquisitions in the first half of 2010, including our anticipated purchase of a 40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which is discussed in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional investments in our waste-to-energy and solid waste businesses. When comparing 2008 with 2007, the decrease in interest income is primarily due to (i) significant declines in market interest rates; (ii) the recognition of $7 million in interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group; and (iii) a decrease in our average cash and investment balances. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities — During 2007, our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our equity interests in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. The equity losses generated by the facilities were offset by the tax benefits realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for income taxes. Provision for Income Taxes — We recorded provisions for income taxes of $413 million in 2009, $669 million in 2008 and $540 million in 2007. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 28.1%, 37.2% and 30.9% for each of the three years, respectively. At current income levels, we expect that our 2010 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 38%. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before taxes; (ii) the utilization of capital loss carry-back; (iii) the realization of state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards; (iv) changes in effective 42 Table of Contents state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (v) differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements; and (vi) the impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits, which expired at the end of 2007. The impacts of these items are summarized below: • Utilization of capital loss carry-back — During 2009, we generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and determined that the capital loss could be utilized to offset capital gains from prior years (specifically 2006 and 2007). The utilization of this capital loss resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income taxes” of $65 million, representing a 4.4 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate. • State net operating loss and credit carry-forwards — During 2009 and 2008, we realized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards by reducing related valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction to our “Provision for income taxes” for those periods of $35 million and $3 million, respectively. No corresponding benefit was recognized in 2007. • Canadian and state effective tax rates — During 2009, the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which resulted in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. During 2007, the Canadian federal government enacted tax rate reductions, which resulted in a $30 million tax benefit for the revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. We did not have any comparable adjustments to Canadian rates during 2008. During 2009, our current state tax rate increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our deferred state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 5.75%. During 2008, our current state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 6.0%. The increases in these rates was primarily due to changes in state law. • Tax audit settlements — Excluding the effects of interest income, the settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. • Non-conventional fuel tax credits — Through December 31, 2007, non-conventional fuel tax credits were derived from our landfills and our investments in two coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities. Our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $50 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax credits resulted in a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007. Noncontrolling Interests — Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $66 million in 2009, $41 million in 2008 and $46 million in 2007. In each period, these amounts have been principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group. The profitability of one of the LLCs has improved in 2009 as a result of an increase in the rentals paid by Wheelabrator to the LLC for the lease of one of the facilities. We have consolidated these variable interest entities since 2003 because we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes. We are in the process of reconsidering our consolidation of the LLCs as a result of revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has also been affected by significant adjustments recognized in consolidated operating expenses for changes in the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets as a result of changes in the U.S. Treasury rates used to measure these balances. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2009 and we owned or operated 267 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 43 Table of Contents 2008, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Remaining cubic yards 4,546 739 5,285 4,456 816 5,272 Remaining tonnage 4,075 726 4,801 3,979 794 4,773 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2009 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 35 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 39 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2009, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 14 11 37 68 81 211 Operated through lease(a) 5 4 5 5 7 26 Operating contracts(b) 12 5 10 5 4 36 Total landfills 31 20 52 78 92 273 (a) From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. The property owner is generally responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our operating contracts. 44 Table of Contents The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance, beginning of year 3,979 794 4,773 3,787 893 4,680 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 33 — 33 20 15 35 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 83 83 — 94 94 Expansion permits granted(b) 129 (129 ) — 228 (228 ) — Airspace consumed (92 ) — (92 ) (107 ) — (107 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 26 (22 ) 4 51 20 71 Balance, end of year 4,075 726 4,801 3,979 794 4,773 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted; and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at ten of our landfills during 2009 and 28 of our landfills during 2008, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2009 and 2008 are shown below (in thousands): 2009 2008 # of Total Tons # of Total Tons Sites Tons per Day Sites Tons per Day Solid waste landfills 268 (a) 91,901 337 267 106,731 391 Hazardous waste landfills 5 1,026 4 6 1,384 5 273 92,927 341 273 108,115 396 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 4 328 9 882 93,255 (b) 108,997 (b) (a) In 2009, we acquired 3 landfills, closed 4 landfills and resumed operations at one landfill that we had previously closed. 45 Table of Contents (b) These amounts include 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2009 and 2.0 million tons at December 31, 2008 that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2009, our closed sites management group manages 201 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to ready a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2009 (in millions): Accumulated Cost Basis of Landfill Airspace Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2008 $ 11,716 $ (6,053 ) $ 5,663 Capital additions 380 — 380 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 39 — 39 Acquisitions 35 — 35 Amortization of landfill airspace — (358 ) (358 ) Foreign currency translation 169 (45 ) 124 Asset retirements and other adjustments (38 ) 8 (30 ) December 31, 2009 $ 12,301 $ (6,448 ) $ 5,853 As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that we will spend approximately $500 million in 2010, and approximately $1 billion in 2011 and 2012 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations, and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. 46 Table of Contents The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2009 (in millions): Environmental Landfill Remediation December 31, 2008 $ 1,218 $ 299 Obligations incurred and capitalized 39 — Obligations settled (80 ) (43 ) Interest accretion 80 6 Revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions 5 (7 ) Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 5 1 December 31, 2009 $ 1,267 $ 256 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 80 $ 77 $ 74 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets (30 ) 41 17 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 69 69 59 Landfill remediation costs 23 17 17 Other landfill site costs 80 87 94 Total landfill operating costs $ 222 $ 291 $ 261 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been most significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, our leachate collection costs were higher in certain of our geographic Groups than they had been in 2007, primarily due to increased precipitation in the affected regions. Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific final capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per ton amortization rates. 47 Table of Contents The following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 358 $ 429 $ 440 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 92 107 114 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 3.90 $ 4.01 $ 3.86 Different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 273 landfills, and per ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was reduced by $14 million in 2009, $3 million in 2008 and $17 million in 2007, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) repaying debt and discharging other obligations; and (vii) investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. 48 Table of Contents Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (in millions): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,140 $ 480 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 65 $ 123 Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 231 213 Debt service funds — 35 Other 10 10 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 306 $ 381 Debt: Current portion $ 749 $ 835 Long-term portion 8,124 7,491 Total debt $ 8,873 $ 8,326 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 91 $ 150 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations, all of which have original maturities of three months or less. The year-over-year increase in our cash balances is largely attributable to our November 2009 senior note issuance, which is discussed below. We intend to use a significant portion of the proceeds of this debt issuance to fund investments and acquisitions during the first half of 2010, including our anticipated purchase of a 40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which is discussed in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as additional investments in our waste-to-energy and solid waste businesses. Pending application of the offering proceeds as described, we have temporarily invested the proceeds in money market funds, which are reflected as cash equivalents in our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of (i) funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations; and (ii) funds received from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2009 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 can primarily be attributed to (i) $1,749 million of cash borrowings, including $793 million in net proceeds from the February 2009 issuance of $800 million of senior notes and $592 million in net proceeds from the November 2009 issuance of $600 million of senior notes; (ii) the cash repayment of $1,335 million of outstanding borrowings; (iii) proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings of $130 million; (iv) a $59 million decrease in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps; (v) a $40 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to foreign currency translation; and (vi) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to acquisitions, interest accretion and capital leases. As of December 31, 2009, we had (i) $998 million of debt maturing within twelve months, consisting primarily of U.S.$255 million under our Canadian credit facility and $600 million of 7.375% senior notes that mature in 49 Table of Contents August 2010; and (ii) $767 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months. The amount reported as the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2009 excludes certain of these amounts because we have the intent and ability to refinance portions of our current maturities on a long-term basis. Refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our classification of current maturities based on our intent and ability, given the capacity available under our revolving credit facility and Canadian credit facility, to refinance certain of these borrowings on a long-term basis. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by facility: 2009 2008 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 1,578 $ 1,803 Letter of credit facilities(b) 371 272 Other(c) 173 91 $ 2,122 $ 2,166 (a) WMI’s $2.4 billion revolving credit facility matures in August 2011. At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings and $1,578 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility. The unused and available credit capacity was $822 million at December 31, 2009. (b) At December 31, 2009, we have a $175 million letter of credit facility that expires in June 2010, a $105 million letter of credit facility that expires in June 2013 and a $100 million letter of credit facility that expires in December 2014. At December 31, 2009, no borrowings were outstanding under these agreements, and we had $9 million of unused and available capacity. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,362 $ 2,575 $ 2,439 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,250 ) $ (1,183 ) $ (761 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (457 ) $ (1,256 ) $ (1,946 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: • Decrease in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $419 million on a year-over-year basis. However, this earnings decline included the impact of the following non-cash charges: • The determination to abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system resulted in non-cash impairment charges of $51 million • The recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of a landfill in California. Further, approximately $55 million of the year-over-year decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets.” The comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was also affected by an $86 million decrease in non-cash charges attributable to (i) equity-based compensation expense; (ii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities; and (iii) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities 50 Table of Contents and recovery assets. While the decrease in non-cash charges favorably affected our earnings comparison, there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. • Change in receivables — There was a significant decrease in the operating cash flows provided by changes in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, when comparing 2009 with 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to unusual activity in 2008, including (i) the significant decrease in sequential quarter revenues when comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 with the third quarter of 2008, which was driven by the decline in the demand and market prices for recyclable commodities; and (ii) the collection of a $60 million outstanding receivable related to our investments in synthetic fuel production facilities that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007. • Decreased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $140 million lower on a year-over-year basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. • Decreased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $60 million lower on a year-over-year basis. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in market interest rates, which (i) increased the benefits to our interest costs provided by our active interest rate swap agreements; and (ii) reduced the interest costs associated with our variable-rate tax-exempt debt. • Decreased bonus payments — Employee bonus payments earned in 2008, which were paid in the first quarter of 2009, were lower than the bonus payments earned in 2007 but paid in 2008 due to the relative strength of our financial performance against incentive measures in 2007 as compared with 2008. The year-over-year decrease in cash bonuses favorably affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $35 million. • Termination of interest rate swaps — In December 2009, we elected to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350 million that were scheduled to mature in November 2012. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $20 million in cash for their fair value plus accrued interest receivable. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in other assets within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Accounts payable processes — We continue to work to improve our working capital management, including continuing to manage our accounts payable process in a manner that provides optimal cash management, which has favorably impacted our year-over-year cash flow from operations change by approximately $20 million. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: • Earnings decline — Our income from operations, net of depreciation and amortization, decreased by $41 million, on a year-over-year basis, which negatively affected our cash flow from operations in 2008. • Receivables — The change in our trade receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, provided a source of cash of approximately $185 million in 2008. In 2008, our receivables balances declined primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved efficiency of collections. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2008, we collected an outstanding receivable related to our investments in the synthetic fuel production facilities that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007. Approximately $60 million of the cash we received represented a refund of amounts that we paid to the facilities during 2006 and 2007 for which we did not ultimately realize a tax benefit, and was reflected as an operating cash inflow. • Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $170 million higher on a year-over-year basis, due in large part to an increase in both our taxable income and our effective tax rate. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. In addition, the overpayment of income taxes in 2006 reduced our 2007 tax payments. 51 Table of Contents • Decreased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $65 million lower on a year-over-year basis. This decline is due primarily to a decline in our weighted average borrowing rate, which can be attributed to the maturity of higher rate debt that we refinanced at lower rates and a decline in market rates. • Accounts payable processes — In 2008, we began various initiatives to improve our working capital management, including reviewing our accounts payable process to ensure vendor payments are made on a basis that results in more optimal cash management. The changes made to the timing of our vendor payments favorably impacted our cash flow from operations on a year-over-year basis by approximately $30 million. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions increased from $90 million during 2007 to $280 million during 2008 and to $281 million in 2009 due to an increased focus on acquisitions and other investments. • Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $28 million in 2009, $112 million in 2008, and $278 million in 2007. Our proceeds from divestitures for all three years have been driven by the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations. The decrease in proceeds from divestitures in 2008 and 2009 was largely a result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as part of our fix-or-seek-exit initiative. • Capital expenditures — We used $1,179 million during 2009 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,221 million in 2008 and $1,211 million in 2007. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $196 million to our investing activities in 2009 compared with $178 million in 2008 and $120 million in 2007. • Purchases and sales of short-term investments — Net sales of short-term investments provided $184 million of cash in 2007. We used proceeds from the sale of our short-term investments to provide cash that we used to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, which are discussed below. We did not hold any short-term investments during 2008 or 2009. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases and dividend payments — Our 2009, 2008 and 2007 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $226 million for share repurchases in 2009, compared with $410 million in 2008 and $1,421 million in 2007. We repurchased approximately 7 million, 12 million and 40 million shares of our common stock in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The significant declines in share repurchases for 2008 and 2009 are largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in late 2008 given the state of the financial markets and the economy. Given the stabilization of the capital markets and economic conditions, we elected to resume our share repurchases during the third quarter of 2009. We paid an aggregate of $569 million in cash dividends during 2009, compared with $531 million in 2008 and $495 million in 2007. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.24 in 2007, to $0.27 in 2008 and to $0.29 in 2009. In December 2009, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.315 per share for dividends declared in 2010. All future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and the Board of Directors will declare dividends at their discretion, with any decisions dependent on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future acquisitions and investments and other factors the Board may deem relevant. 52 Table of Contents • Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and warrants — The exercise of common stock options and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $24 million of financing cash inflows during 2009 compared with $44 million during 2008 and $168 million in 2007. • Net debt repayments — Net debt borrowings were $414 million in 2009, and net debt repayments were $260 million in 2008 and $256 million in 2007. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility $ — $ 350 $ 300 Canadian credit facility 364 581 644 Senior notes 1,385 594 — $ 1,749 $ 1,525 $ 944 Repayments: Revolving credit facility $ (310 ) $ (371 ) $ — Canadian credit facility (395 ) (634 ) (680 ) Senior notes (500 ) (633 ) (300 ) Tax exempt bonds (65 ) (19 ) (52 ) Tax exempt project bonds (39 ) (67 ) (61 ) Capital leases and other debt (26 ) (61 ) (107 ) $ (1,335 ) $ (1,785 ) $ (1,200 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ 414 $ (260 ) $ (256 ) This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and debt repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, these non-cash financing activities were primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings. Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds, were $105 million in 2009, $169 million in 2008 and $144 million in 2007. • Accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances — Changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances are reflected as “Other” financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. There are significant changes in these accrued liability balances as of each year-end, which is generally attributable to the timing of cash deposits. 53 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 125 $ 100 $ 96 $ 90 $ 90 $ 1,947 $ 2,448 Environmental remediation 41 36 23 17 14 146 277 166 136 119 107 104 2,093 2,725 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 985 259 584 174 430 6,358 8,790 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 88 75 72 58 47 258 598 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f),(g),(h) 166 61 53 31 18 278 607 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2009 $ 1,405 $ 531 $ 828 $ 370 $ 599 $ 8,987 $ 12,720 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2009 include $767 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. (g) In December 2009, we entered into a plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 to effect market purchases of our common stock. We have included $58 million of common stock repurchases in our 2010 contractual obligations because this amount represents the minimum amount of common stock that could be repurchased under the terms of the plan. We repurchased $68 million of our common stock pursuant to the plan, which was completed on February 12, 2010. 54 Table of Contents (h) In August 2009, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, a subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding, for approximately $140 million. As of December 31, 2009, our investment was subject to regulatory approval. Accordingly, the impact of this cash investment was excluded from amounts reported herein. The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China approved the transaction in January 2010 and we currently expect the transaction to close during the first half of 2010. Liquidity Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions As discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2009 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the traditional seasonal increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends, although we saw a significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than we generally experience. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes experienced by our Southern Group, can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including significant mobilization costs, such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2009, approximately 35% of our collection revenues were generated under long-term franchise agreements with municipalities or similar local or regional authorities. These contractual agreements generally provide for price adjustments based on various indicies intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. This revised guidance replaces the current quantitative-based assessment for determining which enterprise has a controlling interest in a variable interest entity with an approach that is now primarily qualitative. This qualitative approach focuses on identifying the enterprise that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. This revised guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than a reassessment only upon 55 Table of Contents the occurrence of specific events. The new FASB-issued authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities is effective for the Company January 1, 2010. The change in accounting may either be applied by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption or by retrospectively restating one or more years and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest year restated. We are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of this revised guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — In September 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are effective for the Company January 1, 2011, although the FASB does permit early adoption of the guidance provided that it is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. The new accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this new guidance and currently do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to the extent they are material. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2009, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2009, we had $8.8 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $3.0 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2010. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $1.1 billion of “receive fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixed-rate senior notes; (ii) $817 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to re-pricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (iii) $767 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within twelve months; and (iv) $257 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, the effective interest rates of approximately $3.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was subject to change within twelve months. The decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable interest rates in 2009 is generally as a result of an $850 million decrease in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps offset, in part, by an increase in the portion of our outstanding tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within twelve months. The decline in our variable-rate debt obligations has reduced the potential volatility to our operating results and cash flows that results from fluctuations in market interest rates. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2010 interest expense by approximately $23 million. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we have Treasury rate locks with a notional amount 56 Table of Contents of $200 million and forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $525 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $610 million at December 31, 2009. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including aluminum, old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in the markets where we operate. During the three years ended December 31, 2009, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. During 2009, approximately 34% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently expect that nearly 50% of our electricity revenues at our waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates in 2010. Our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased because several long-term power purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that medium- and long-term electricity contracts are less favorable in the current environment. As we renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our waste-to-energy facilities and landfill gas-to-energy plants will be based on current market rates. Accordingly, in 2010 we will be implementing a more actively managed energy program, which will include a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity. Currency Rate Exposure — From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. 57 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:45:00.577576
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2010. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our 2010 results of operations reflect our discipline in pricing, our ability to control costs in our collection and disposal operations and our continued investment in our strategic initiatives, which will enable us to grow into new markets, provide expanded service offerings and improve our information technology systems. Our results also reflect an improvement in the general economic environment. Highlights of our financial results for 2010 include: • Revenues of $12.5 billion compared with $11.8 billion in 2009, an increase of $724 million, or 6.1%. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to: • Increases from recyclable commodity prices of $423 million; increases from our fuel surcharge program of $69 million; and increases from foreign currency translation of $66 million; • Increases associated with acquired businesses of $240 million; and • Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal business of 2.3% in the current period, which increased revenue by $239 million; • Internal revenue growth from volume was negative 2.6% in 2010, compared with negative 8.1% in 2009. In addition to the lower rate of decline driven by changes in the economy, our volume was favorably affected by revenues associated with oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast. The year-over-year decline in internal revenue growth due to volume was $304 million; • Operating expenses of $7.8 billion, or 62.5% of revenues, compared with $7.2 billion, or 61.4% of revenues, in 2009. This increase of $583 million, or 8.1%, is due primarily to higher customer rebates because of recyclable commodity prices; higher fuel prices; increases in subcontractor costs associated with our oil spill clean-up services along the Gulf Coast; and increases in our landfill operating costs; • Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $97 million, or 7.1%, from $1.4 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010. These cost increases were primarily due to support of our strategic growth plans and initiatives; • Income from operations of $2.1 billion, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2010 compared with $1.9 billion, or 16.0% of revenues, in 2009; • Interest expense of $473 million compared with $426 million in 2009, an increase of $47 million, or 11.0%. This increase is primarily due to higher average debt balances, including additional borrowings incurred in late 2009 primarily to support our strategic plans, and higher costs related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility executed in June 2010; and • Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $953 million, or $1.98 per diluted share for 2010, as compared with $994 million, or $2.01 per diluted share in 2009. The comparability of our 2010 results with 2009 has been affected by certain items management believes are not representative or indicative of our performance. Our 2010 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $55 million related to remediation and closure costs at five closed sites, which had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; • The recognition of net tax charges of $32 million due to refinements in estimates of our deferred state income taxes and the finalization of our 2009 tax returns, partially offset by favorable tax audit settlements, all of which, combined, had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; 26 Table of Contents • The recognition of a net favorable pre-tax benefit of $46 million for litigation and associated costs, which had a favorable impact of $0.06 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of net pre-tax charges of $26 million as a result of the withdrawal of certain of our union bargaining units from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2009 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of a tax benefit of $130 million due principally to favorable adjustments from the carry-back of a capital loss, the recognition of state net operating losses and tax credits, the finalization of our 2008 tax returns, the impact of tax audit settlements and the revaluation of deferred taxes due to Canadian tax rate reductions. These items had a combined favorable impact of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per share; • The recognition of impairment charges totaling $83 million due primarily to the abandonment of revenue management software and a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in California. These items had a negative impact of $0.10 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax charges of $50 million related to our 2009 restructuring, primarily related to severance and benefit costs. These restructuring charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by $0.06. We are pleased about the lower rate of decline in internal revenue growth from volumes that we experienced during 2010. On the pricing front, our fourth quarter 2010 results were the strongest of the year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective of achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above the consumer price index, or CPI. In 2011, we will remain committed to our pricing discipline. Based on an anticipated CPI run-rate of 1.0%, we expect our overall revenue growth from yield to be approximately 2.0%. Additionally, we expect our revenue growth from volumes to be flat to slightly positive. However, we are mindful of trends toward waste reduction at the source, diversion from landfills and customers seeking alternative methods of disposal. We will continue to implement measures that we believe will grow our business, improve our current operations performance and enhance and expand our services. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,275 $ 2,362 Capital expenditures (1,104 ) (1,179 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets 44 28 Free cash flow $ 1,215 $ 1,211 27 Table of Contents Our free cash flow was consistent in both years, however our cash provided by operating activities decreased $87 million and our capital expenditures decreased $75 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net unfavorable changes in working capital, increased interest payments and higher income tax payments. These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by a cash benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement that occurred in April 2010. Payments made in 2009 related to severance and benefits costs associated with our 2009 restructuring also affected the comparability of our operating cash flow for the periods presented. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 compared with 2009 can generally be attributed to timing of cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital expenditures. We generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year. A less significant portion of our fourth quarter 2009 capital expenditures were paid for in cash in 2010, as compared with the portion of our fourth quarter 2008 capital expenditures that were paid for in cash in 2009. Our ability to generate over $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2010 enabled us to return $1.1 billion in cash to stockholders during the year through the payment of $604 million in dividends and the repurchase of $501 million of our common stock. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and is, therefore, required to consolidate the entity. This new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity. The new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events. As a result of our implementation of this guidance, effective January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others. Our financial interests in these entities are discussed in Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented. Business Combinations — In December 2007, the FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements related to business combinations. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that relate to business combinations completed before January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Further, business combinations completed subsequent to January 1, 2009, which are discussed in Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, have not been material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent that future business combinations are material, our adoption of the FASB’s revised authoritative guidance associated with business combinations may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result of (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets, liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such amounts can be determined and (ii) the requirement that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated 28 Table of Contents financial statements. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented, resulted in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial information and the remeasurement of our 2008 effective tax rate, which is discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements — In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements. This guidance defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the guidance for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance for non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis effective January 1, 2009. The application of the fair value framework did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and (iv) the airspace associated with each capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each capping event is then quantified and the capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately 29 Table of Contents through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 33 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2010, 14 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining six landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. 30 Table of Contents Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. 31 Table of Contents Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess our goodwill for impairment. We assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our operating segments. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating segments’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our operating segments. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods. 32 Table of Contents Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five Groups. Our four geographic Groups, comprised of our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection, transfer, disposal (in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills) and recycling services. Our fifth Group is the Wheelabrator Group, which provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. These five Groups are our reportable segments. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our five Groups, including recycling brokerage services, electronic recycling services, in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy services and the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eastern $ 2,943 $ 2,960 $ 3,319 Midwest 3,048 2,855 3,267 Southern 3,461 3,328 3,740 Western 3,173 3,125 3,387 Wheelabrator 889 841 912 Other 963 628 897 Intercompany (1,962 ) (1,946 ) (2,134 ) Total $ 12,515 $ 11,791 $ 13,388 Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the MRF or disposal facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services 33 Table of Contents generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel. Our waste-to-energy revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator Group, are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam. Our “Other” revenues include our landfill gas-to-energy operations, Port-O-Let® services, portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Collection $ 8,247 $ 7,980 $ 8,679 Landfill 2,540 2,547 2,955 Transfer 1,318 1,383 1,589 Wheelabrator 889 841 912 Recycling 1,169 741 1,180 Other 314 245 207 Intercompany (1,962 ) (1,946 ) (2,134 ) Total $ 12,515 $ 11,791 $ 13,388 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 As a % of As a % of Total Total Amount Company(a) Amount Company(a) Average yield(b) $ 724 6.1 % $ (528 ) (3.9 )% Volume (304 ) (2.6 ) (1,078 ) (8.1 ) Internal revenue growth 420 3.5 (1,606 ) (12.0 ) Acquisitions 240 2.0 97 0.7 Divestitures (2 ) — (37 ) (0.2 ) Foreign currency translation 66 0.6 (51 ) (0.4 ) $ 724 6.1 % $ (1,597 ) (11.9 )% (a) Calculated by dividing the amount of current year increase or decrease by the prior year’s total company revenue ($11,791 million and $13,388 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively) adjusted to exclude the impacts of current year divestitures ($2 million and $37 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively). (b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related-business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related-business basis: 34 Table of Contents Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 As a % of As a % of Related Related Amount Business(i) Amount Business(i) Average yield: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 218 2.2 % $ 321 3.0 % Waste-to-energy disposal(ii) 21 5.1 2 0.5 Collection and disposal(ii) 239 2.3 323 2.9 Recycling commodities 423 58.5 (447 ) (36.3 ) Electricity(ii) (7 ) (2.5 ) (76 ) (21.3 ) Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 69 18.4 (328 ) (46.5 ) Total $ 724 6.1 $ (528 ) (3.9 ) (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior-year’s related-business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year ($2 million and $37 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively). The table below summarizes the related-business revenues for each year, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures: Denominator 2010 2009 Related-business revenues: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 9,999 $ 10,622 Waste-to-energy disposal 413 434 Collection and disposal 10,412 11,056 Recycling commodities 723 1,233 Electricity 279 356 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 375 706 Total Company $ 11,789 $ 13,351 (ii) Average revenue growth for yield for “Collection and disposal” excludes all electricity-related revenues generated by our Wheelabrator Group, which are reported as “Electricity” revenues. Our revenues increased $724 million, or 6.1%, and decreased $1,597 million, or 11.9% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The year-over-year change in revenues for both periods has been driven by (i) market factors, including fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices that favorably impacted revenue growth in 2010 and negatively affected revenue growth in 2009; volatility in diesel prices that affects the revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program, which favorably contributed to our revenues in 2010 and negatively affected our revenues in 2009, and foreign currency translation, which favorably affected revenues from our Canadian operations in 2010 but negatively impacted our revenues in 2009; (ii) revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations in both periods; and (iii) acquisitions. Further affecting revenue changes were revenue declines due to lower volumes that generally resulted from the continued weakness of the overall economic environment, increased pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. 35 Table of Contents Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. In both 2010 and 2009, our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield demonstrates our commitment to our pricing strategies despite the current economic environment. This increase in revenue from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations, which experienced yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic operating Group. We have found that increasing our yield in today’s market is a challenge given the reduced volume levels resulting from the economic slowdown. However, revenue growth from yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs have provided margin improvements in our collection line of business. Additionally, a significant portion of our collection revenues is generated under long-term agreements with municipalities or similar local or regional authorities. These agreements generally tie pricing adjustments to inflation indices, which have been low in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008. Despite this headwind, we continue to meet our pricing objective of achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above CPI. We are committed to maintaining pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business. Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in average yield on collection and disposal, increased by $33 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Environmental fee revenues totaled $251 million in 2010 as compared with $218 million in 2009 and $181 million in 2008. Recycling commodities — Increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we process resulted in an increase in revenues of $423 million in 2010 as compared with 2009. Market prices for recyclable commodities have increased significantly from the near-historic lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009. For the twelve months of 2010, overall commodity prices have increased approximately 57% as compared with 2009. In 2009, lower recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue decline of $447 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we saw a rapid decline in commodity prices from the record-high prices we had been experiencing prior to the decline due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally. Commodity demand and prices in the first nine months of 2009 remained well below the demand and prices in the comparable prior-year period. Electricity — The changes in revenue from yield provided by our waste-to-energy business are largely due to fluctuations in rates we can receive for electricity under our power purchase contracts and in merchant transactions. In most of the markets in which we operate, electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices. We experienced declines in revenue from yield at our waste-to-energy facilities of $7 million and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These declines are due to the expiration of certain above-market contracts, resulting in greater exposure to market pricing. In 2010, approximately 47% of the waste-to-energy generation portfolio was subject to market price movements, compared with 46% in 2009 and 24% in 2008. Our waste-to-energy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional long-term contracts expire; however, we are beginning to see an improvement in market pricing. In addition, we have increased our hedging activities to better manage this risk. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — Revenue predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by $69 million and decreased by $328 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fluctuation is directly attributed to the fluctuation in the national average prices of diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through to customers of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — Our revenue decline due to volume was $304 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010. This is a notable improvement in the rate of revenue decline from the prior-year period when revenue decline due to volume was $1,078 million, or 8.1%. Volume declines are generally attributable to economic conditions, increased pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers. 36 Table of Contents In 2010, our collection business accounted for $254 million of the total volume-related revenue decline. We have experienced commercial and residential collection volume declines that we attribute to the overall weakness in the economy, as well as the effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by consumers. Our industrial collection operations continued to be affected by the current economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the United States. The overall volume decline in the collection line of business was offset in part by an increase in volumes of $99 million associated with oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in the current-year period, and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. However, in 2010, our landfill revenues increased due to higher third-party volumes. This increase was principally due to higher special waste volumes in our Midwest and Southern geographic Groups, which were driven in part by our continued focus on our customers and better meeting their needs. We are pleased with the lessening rate of revenue decline due to lower volumes. However, (i) the continued weakness of the overall economic environment; (ii) recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers; and (iii) pricing and competition are presenting challenges to maintaining and growing volumes. In 2009, our collection business accounted for $622 million of the total volume decline. Our industrial collection operations experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes, primarily as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the United States. We also experienced volume declines in our commercial and residential collection lines of businesses in 2009. We attributed these volume declines to the economy, although at a lesser rate than our industrial line of business since they are somewhat recession resistant, as well as to pricing and competition. In 2009, we also experienced a 16% decline in third-party revenue due to volume at our landfills. This decrease was most significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and construction and demolition waste streams, although municipal solid waste streams at our landfills also decreased. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. Lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in revenues of $74 million in 2009. These decreases were attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and international demand for recyclables in late 2008. Acquisitions and divestitures — Revenues increased $240 million and $97 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to acquisitions, principally in (i) the collection and recycling lines of business in both periods, as well as our waste-to-energy line of business in 2010 and (ii) our “Other” businesses, demonstrating our current focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new, complementary lines of business. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of $2 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. 37 Table of Contents Our operating expenses increased $583 million, or 8.1%, when comparing 2010 with 2009 and decreased by $1,225 million, or 14.5%, when comparing 2009 with 2008. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.5% in 2010, 61.4% in 2009 and 63.2% in 2008. The changes in our operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 can largely be attributed to the following: Changes in market prices for recyclable commodities — Overall, market prices for recyclable commodities were approximately 57% higher on average during 2010 than in 2009. The year-over-year increase is the result of the recovery in recyclable commodity prices from the near-historic lows reached in late 2008 and early 2009. This increase in market prices was the driver of the current year increase in cost of goods sold, primarily customer rebates, and has also resulted in increased revenues and earnings this year. When comparing 2009 with 2008, market prices for recyclable commodities had the opposite effect on our results as they declined approximately 39%. Acquisitions and growth initiatives — In both 2010 and 2009, we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives. These cost increases have affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below. Fuel price changes — Higher market prices for fuel caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs for the year ended December 31, 2010, while lower market prices caused decreases in these costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. On average, diesel fuel prices increased 21%, to $2.99 per gallon for 2010 from $2.46 per gallon for 2009; while they decreased in 2009 by 35%, from $3.81 per gallon in 2008. Canadian exchange rates — When comparing the average exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10%, which increased our expenses in all operating cost categories. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased our total operating expenses by $52 million for 2010 as compared with 2009. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7% and decreased our total operating expenses by $40 million. Volume declines and divestitures — Throughout 2010 and 2009, we experienced volume declines as a result of the continued weakness of the overall economic environment, pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion by consumers. Note that the revenue decline due to lower volume moderated in 2010 as compared with the volume decline in 2009, particularly in the second half of the year. During 2009 we also experienced volume declines as a result of divestitures. We continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines, and have achieved significant cost savings as a result. These cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2010 Period Change 2009 Period Change 2008 Labor and related benefits $ 2,300 $ 40 1.8 % $ 2,260 $ (160 ) (6.6 )% $ 2,420 Transfer and disposal costs 943 6 0.6 937 (111 ) (10.6 ) 1,048 Maintenance and repairs 1,041 8 0.8 1,033 (41 ) (3.8 ) 1,074 Subcontractor costs 770 70 10.0 700 (201 ) (22.3 ) 901 Cost of goods sold 776 288 59.0 488 (324 ) (39.9 ) 812 Fuel 493 79 19.1 414 (301 ) (42.1 ) 715 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 589 11 1.9 578 (30 ) (4.9 ) 608 Landfill operating costs 294 72 32.4 222 (69 ) (23.7 ) 291 Risk management 202 (9 ) (4.3 ) 211 2 1.0 209 Other 416 18 4.5 398 10 2.6 388 $ 7,824 $ 583 8.1 % $ 7,241 $ (1,225 ) (14.5 )% $ 8,466 38 Table of Contents The period-to-period changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed below. Labor and related benefits — Our 2010 expenses increased as a result of (i) higher salaries and wages due to merit increases that were effective in July 2009 for hourly employees and in April 2010 for both salaried and hourly employees; (ii) additional expenses incurred for acquisitions and growth opportunities; and (iii) the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. These cost increases were offset, in part, by cost savings that have been achieved as volumes declined. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost declines were generally a result of (i) headcount and overtime reductions related to volume declines; (ii) effects of foreign currency translation; (iii) a benefit from the restructuring we initiated in January of 2009, although most of these savings were reflected in our selling, general and administrative expenses; and (iv) cost savings provided by our operational improvement initiatives. These cost savings were offset, in part, by higher hourly wages due to merit increases and increased bonus expense as our performance against targets established by our incentive plans was stronger than it had been in 2008. The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. These costs increased 2010 expense by $26 million, 2009 expense by $9 million and 2008 expense by $42 million. Transfer and disposal costs — During 2009 the cost decreases as compared with 2008 were a result of volume declines and our continued focus on reducing disposal costs associated with our third-party disposal volumes by improving internalization. This decrease was also partially due to foreign currency translation. Maintenance and repairs — Comparing 2009 with 2008, these costs declined as a result of volume declines and various fleet initiatives that favorably affected our maintenance, parts and supplies costs. These decreases were offset partially by cost increases due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. Subcontractor costs — The 2010 increase in subcontractor costs is largely the result of oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast and is also attributable to higher diesel fuel prices. We incurred $54 million in subcontractor costs related to oil spill clean-up activities this year. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost decreases are a result of volume declines, a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign currency translation. Cost of goods sold — The cost changes during the years presented are principally due to changes in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of changes in market prices for recyclable commodities. Fuel — The cost changes for 2010 and 2009 are a result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel and volume declines. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — These cost decreases in 2009 as compared with 2008 are principally a result of volume declines. Landfill operating costs — Increases in these costs in the current year were due, in part, to the recognition of additional estimated expense associated with environmental remediation liabilities of $50 million at four closed sites during 2010. The changes in this category for the years presented were also significantly impacted by the changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. As a result of changes in U.S. Treasury rates, we recognized $2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010, compared with $35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 and $33 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2008. Over the course of 2010, the discount rate we use decreased slightly from 3.75% to 3.50%, although it reached as low as 2.50% in September. During 2009, the rate increased from 2.25% to 3.75% and during 2008, the rate declined from 4.00% to 2.25%. 39 Table of Contents Risk management — The slight year-over-year decrease in 2010 and the consistent cost levels in 2009 and 2008 reflect the success we have had over the last several years in managing these costs, which can be credited primarily to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. Other — The comparison of these costs has been significantly affected by the following: • In 2010, the increase in costs compared with 2009 was attributable, in part, to (i) our various growth and business development initiatives, (ii) oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast, and (iii) recently acquired businesses. These cost increases were partially offset by an increase in gains recognized from the sale of surplus real estate assets. • In 2009, we had a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our waste-to-energy facilities. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $97 million, or 7.1%, when comparing 2010 with 2009 and decreased $113 million, or 7.7%, when comparing 2009 with 2008. The current year increase is largely due to (i) increased costs of $52 million during 2010, incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings and (ii) increased costs of $23 million during 2010, resulting from improvements we are making to our information technology systems. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the decrease was due in part to (i) the realization of benefits associated with our January 2009 restructuring and (ii) increased efforts to reduce controllable spending. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 11.7% in 2010, 11.6% in 2009 and 11.0% in 2008. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2010 Period Change 2009 Period Change 2008 Labor and related benefits $ 845 $ 70 9.0 % $ 775 $ (78 ) (9.1 )% $ 853 Professional fees 175 8 4.8 167 (1 ) (0.6 ) 168 Provision for bad debts 45 (9 ) (16.7 ) 54 (3 ) (5.3 ) 57 Other 396 28 7.6 368 (31 ) (7.8 ) 399 $ 1,461 $ 97 7.1 % $ 1,364 $ (113 ) (7.7 )% $ 1,477 Labor and related benefits — In 2010, our labor and related benefits costs increased due primarily to (i) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases; (ii) higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our growth initiatives; (iii) additional bonus expense in 2010 because our performance against targets established by our annual incentive plans was stronger in 2010 compared with 2009; (iv) increased contract labor costs as a result of our current focus on optimizing our information technology systems; (v) increased severance costs; and (vi) higher non-cash compensation costs incurred for equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plans. During the second quarter of 2009, we reversed all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it was no longer probable that the targets established for that award would be met. Additionally, stock option equity awards granted during the first quarter of 2010 provide for continued vesting for three years following an employee’s retirement, and because retirement-eligible employees are not required to provide any future service to vest in these awards, we recognized all of the compensation expense associated with their awards immediately. We did not incur similar charges in prior years because this retirement provision was not included in any of the equity awards that were granted in 2009 or in 2008. 40 Table of Contents In 2009, our labor and related benefits costs decreased from 2008 because we realized benefits associated with our January 2009 restructuring. Our labor and related benefits expenses in 2009 were also affected by a significant decrease in non-cash compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plans as a result of (i) a decline in the grant-date fair value of our equity awards; (ii) lower performance against established targets for certain awards than in the prior year; and (iii) the reversal of all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units. This decrease in non-cash compensation costs was offset, in part, by higher costs associated with our salary deferral plan, the costs of which are directly affected by equity-market conditions. Additionally, contract labor costs incurred for various Corporate support functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008. Professional fees — In 2010, our professional fees increased due to consulting fees, driven primarily by improvements we are making to our information technology systems and our continued strategic focus to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees in 2010. Provision for bad debts — Our provision for bad debts was higher in 2009 and in 2008 as compared with 2010 as a result of the Company’s assessment of the weak economic environment in those years and the resulting impacts on our collection risk. However, in the latter part of 2009 and during 2010 our collection risk moderated, thus resulting in a lower provision in 2010. Other — During 2010, we experienced increases in our (i) litigation reserves, (ii) marketing and advertising costs, due in part to our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings, and (iii) computer costs, due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems. In 2009, our focus on reducing controllable spending resulted in decreases in our advertising, meetings, seminars, and travel and entertainment costs. These lower costs were partially due to the January 2009 restructuring. This decline was offset partially by unfavorable litigation settlements in 2009. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 781 $ 2 0.3 % $ 779 $ (6 ) (0.8 )% $ 785 Amortization of landfill airspace 372 14 3.9 358 (71 ) (16.6 ) 429 Amortization of intangible assets 41 12 41.4 29 5 20.8 24 $ 1,194 $ 28 2.4 % $ 1,166 $ (72 ) (5.8 )% $ 1,238 The increase in amortization expense of landfill airspace in 2010 is largely due to adjustments to the amortization rates at various landfill sites. These adjustments were principally attributable to increases in cost estimates. The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2009 is largely due to volume declines as a 41 Table of Contents result of (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing strategy and competition, both of which significantly reduced our collection volumes; and (iii) the re-direction of waste to third-party disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are seeking an expansion permit. The comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our capping, closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $13 million, $14 million and $3 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with capping changes that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred capping costs. The increase in amortization expense of intangible assets in 2010 is due to our focus on the growth and development of our business through acquisitions and other investments. The current year increases are primarily related to the amortization of definite-lived operating permits acquired by our healthcare solutions operations, customer lists acquired by our Southern and Midwest Groups and gas rights acquired by our renewable energy operations. Restructuring In January 2009, we took steps to further streamline our organization by (i) consolidating our Market Areas; (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations with our other solid waste business; and (iii) realigning our Corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently. Our principal operations are managed through our Groups. Each of our four geographic Groups had been further divided into 45 Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the Market Areas were consolidated into 25 Areas. We found that our larger Market Areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in our smaller Market Areas, and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, responsibility for the oversight of day-to-day recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis. This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this restructuring, of which $41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. In 2010, we recognized $2 million of income related to the reversal of pre-tax restructuring charges. 42 Table of Contents (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Income from divestitures $ (1 ) $ — $ (33 ) Asset impairments — 83 4 Other (77 ) — — $ (78 ) $ 83 $ (29 ) Income from Divestitures — The net gain from divestitures during 2008 was a result of our focus on selling underperforming businesses and primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our Southern Group. Asset Impairments — Through December 31, 2008, we capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of a new waste and recycling revenue management system. A significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use. After a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts associated with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007. During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of the licensed software. Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $51 million, $49 million of which was recognized during the first quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009, for the abandonment of the licensed software. We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by our Western Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in California as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down certain of our investments in portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations. During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge, primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our Southern Group. Other — We filed a lawsuit in March 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009. In April 2010, we settled the lawsuit and received a one-time cash payment. The settlement resulted in an increase in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $77 million. 43 Table of Contents Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Reportable segments: Eastern $ 516 $ 33 6.8 % $ 483 $ (40 ) (7.6 )% $ 523 Midwest 533 83 18.4 450 (25 ) (5.3 ) 475 Southern 844 76 9.9 768 (104 ) (11.9 ) 872 Western 569 48 9.2 521 (91 ) (14.9 ) 612 Wheelabrator 214 (21 ) (8.9 ) 235 (88 ) (27.2 ) 323 Other (135 ) 1 (0.7 ) (136 ) (76 ) * (60 ) Corporate and other (425 ) 9 (2.1 ) (434 ) 77 (15.1 ) (511 ) Total $ 2,116 $ 229 12.1 % $ 1,887 $ (347 ) (15.5 )% $ 2,234 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Reportable Segments — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic Groups during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 are summarized below: • revenue growth from yield on our base business; • market prices for recyclable commodities reflected significant improvement year-over-year during 2010 and a sharp decline during 2009 as compared with 2008; • the accretive benefits of recent acquisitions, in particular during 2010 and to a lesser extent during 2009; • continued volume declines due to economic conditions, increased pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and waste diversion by consumers; • increasing direct and indirect costs for diesel fuel, which outpaced the related revenue growth from our fuel surcharge program in both 2010 and 2009, although a portion of the 2010 shortfall was reduced during the fourth quarter due, in part, to changes we made in our fuel surcharge program; and • higher salaries and wages due to annual merit increases that were effective in July 2009 for hourly employees and in April 2010 for both salaried and hourly employees. The comparability of each of our geographic Groups’ operating results for the periods was also affected by the restructuring charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009. Other significant items affecting the comparability of our Groups’ results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: Eastern — During 2009, the Group recognized (i) an $18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills; and (ii) a $9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in New Jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund. During 2008, the Group’s operating income was negatively affected by a $14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. Midwest — The income from operations of our Midwest Group for 2010 was significantly affected by the recognition of charges of $26 million as a result of employees of five bargaining units in Michigan and Ohio agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan. 44 Table of Contents The Group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by $44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Included in the labor dispute expenses were $32 million in charges related to the withdrawal of certain of the Group’s bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. Additionally, when comparing the average exchange rate for 2010 with 2009, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10%, which increased the Group’s income from operations. When comparing the average exchange rate for 2009 with 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which decreased the Group’s income from operations. The effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this Group because substantially all of our Canadian operations are managed by our Midwest Group. Southern — Additional volumes from oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast and lower repair and maintenance costs favorably impacted the Group’s 2010 income from operations. During 2008, the Group’s operating income was favorably affected by $29 million of divestiture gains, offset, in part, by a $3 million landfill impairment charge. Also favorably affecting the comparison of the Group’s results in 2009 as compared with 2008 was the recognition of $9 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 resulting from changes in estimates associated with our obligations for landfill capping, closure and post-closure. Similar favorable adjustments impacted the Group’s results during 2010. Western — The Group’s 2010 income from operations includes $12 million of additional “Selling, general and administrative” expense recognized as a result of a litigation settlement. The Group’s 2009 income from operations includes the recognition of an impairment charge of $27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in California. Further affecting the comparison of 2010 results with 2009 was the recognition of $7 million of favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense during 2010 associated with our obligations for landfill capping, closure and post-closure, and a net $5 million of expense recognized for adjustments related to these obligations during 2009. The unfavorable adjustments during 2009 primarily related to a closed landfill in Los Angeles, California for which the Group recognized additional amortization expense. The additional expense in 2009 did not affect the comparison to 2008 because, during 2008, we recognized an unfavorable adjustment at the same landfill which was of a similar magnitude. Wheelabrator — The decrease in the income from operations of our Wheelabrator Group for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven by an increase in maintenance-related outages as compared with the prior year, which resulted in decreased electricity generation and increased plant maintenance costs. These increases are attributable to the acceleration of repair and maintenance expenses at our facility in Portsmouth, Virginia that we acquired in April 2010, and expenses at certain of our other facilities. The Group also experienced an increase in litigation settlement costs as compared with 2009. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the benefit of increased revenues from the sale of metals. The comparability of the Group’s 2009 income from operations with 2008 was significantly affected by (i) a decline in market prices for electricity, which had a significant impact on the Group’s results in 2009 due to the expiration of several long-term energy contracts and short-term pricing arrangements; (ii) an increase in costs for international and domestic business development activities; and (iii) an increase in “Operating” expenses of $11 million as a result of a significant increase in the property taxes assessed for one of our waste-to-energy facilities. Exposure to current electricity market prices increased from 24% of total electricity production in 2008 to 46% in 2009. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) the effects of those elements of our in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy operations, and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Upstream®, Renewable Energy and Strategic Accounts organizations, respectively, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling and electronic recycling brokerage services; and (iii) the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings such as portable 45 Table of Contents self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the impacts of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for the Groups or financing for our Canadian operations and also includes certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to the reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. The slight improvement in operating results for our “Other” businesses during 2010 as compared with 2009 is due to improvements in our recycling brokerage business as a result of higher recycling commodity prices this year, largely offset by the unfavorable effects of (i) additional costs in the current year to support the Company’s strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings and (ii) certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. For 2010, the adjustments were primarily related to $15 million of additional expense recognized for litigation reserves and associated costs in the Southern and Wheelabrator Groups. The unfavorable change in 2009 operating results compared with 2008 is largely due to (i) the effect that the previously discussed lower recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage activities; (ii) an increase in costs incurred to support the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business; (iii) the unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our landfill-gas-to-energy operations; and (iv) certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: • a benefit of $128 million when comparing 2010 with 2009 associated with the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009, comprised of (i) a current year benefit of $77 million resulting from a one-time cash payment from a litigation settlement that occurred in April 2010 and (ii) $51 million in charges recognized during 2009 for the abandonment of the licensed software; • the recognition of net charges of $50 million during 2010 for estimates associated with environmental remediation liabilities at four closed sites; • the recognition of $34 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 by our closed sites management group due to increases in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and environmental remediation recovery assets, while in 2010 and 2008 the same group recognized charges to landfill operating costs of $2 million and $32 million, respectively, due to declines in U.S. Treasury rates during those periods; • the recognition of $9 million in restructuring charges during 2009; • a significant increase in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses during 2010 as result of cost increases related to our equity compensation, consulting fees, bonus expense, annual salary and wage increases and headcount increases to support the Company’s strategic initiatives; partially offset by a favorable litigation settlement during the third quarter of 2010; and • a significant decline in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008 resulting from workforce reductions associated with the January 2009 restructuring, increased efforts to reduce our controllable spending and lower equity compensation costs. Renewable Energy Operations We have extracted value from the waste streams we manage for years, and we are focusing on increasing our ability to do so, particularly in the field of clean and renewable energy. Most significantly, our current operations produce renewable energy through the waste-to-energy facilities that are managed by our Wheelabrator Group and our landfill gas-to-energy operations. We are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our existing renewable 46 Table of Contents energy service offerings to ensure that we can respond to the shifting demands of consumers and to ensure that we are acting as a leader in environmental stewardship. We are disclosing the following supplemental information related to the operating results of our renewable energy operations for 2010 (in millions) because we believe that it provides information related to the significance of our current renewable energy operations, the profitability of these operations and the costs we are incurring to develop these operations: Landfill Gas- Growth Wheelabrator to-Energy(a) Opportunities(b) Total Operating revenues (including intercompany) $ 889 $ 126 $ — $ 1,015 Costs and expenses: Operating 512 51 2 565 Selling, general & administrative 99 3 3 105 Depreciation and amortization 64 24 — 88 675 78 5 758 Income (loss) from operations $ 214 $ 48 $ (5 ) $ 257 (a) Our landfill gas-to-energy business focuses on generating a renewable energy source from the methane that is produced as waste decomposes. The operating results include the revenues and expenses of landfill gas-to-energy plants that we own and operate, as well as revenues generated from the sale of landfill gas to third-party owner/operators. The operating results of our landfill gas-to-energy business are included within our geographic reportable segments and “Other”. (b) Includes businesses and entities we have acquired or invested in through our organic growth group’s business development efforts. These businesses include a landfill gas-to-LNG facility; landfill gas-to-diesel fuels technologies; organic waste streams-to-fuels technologies; and other engineered fuels technologies. The operating results of our Growth Opportunities are included within “Other” in our assessment of our income from operations by segment. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $473 million in 2010, $426 million in 2009 and $455 million in 2008. When comparing 2010 with 2009, the significant increase in our interest expense is primarily due to (i) the issuance of an additional $600 million of senior notes in November 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010, (ii) significantly higher costs related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility, which was refinanced in June 2010, and (iii) a decrease in benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding. These increases in interest expense were offset, in part, by a decline in market interest rates, which has reduced the interest costs of our tax-exempt borrowings and our Canadian credit facility. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to declines in market interest rates, which increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest expense associated with our tax-exempt bonds and our Canadian credit facility. Interest income Interest income was $4 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009 and $19 million in 2008. The decreases in interest income are primarily related to a decline in market interest rates. Although our average cash and cash equivalents balances increased each year, near-historic low short-term interest rates have resulted in insignificant interest income being generated on current balances. 47 Table of Contents Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities During 2010, our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. The equity losses generated by the limited liability company were more than offset by tax benefits realized as a result of this investment as discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our federal low-income housing investment. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $629 million in 2010, $413 million in 2009 and $669 million in 2008. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 38.5%, 28.1%, and 37.2% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) the utilization of a capital loss carry-back; (iii) the realization of state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards; (iv) changes in effective state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (v) tax audit settlements; and (vi) the impact of federal low-income housing tax credits. The impacts of these items are summarized below: • Capital Loss Carry-back — During 2009, we generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. We determined that the capital loss could be utilized to offset capital gains from 2006 and 2007, which resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income taxes” of $65 million. • State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards — During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we released state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our “Provision for income taxes” for those periods of $4 million, $35 million and $3 million, respectively. • Canadian and State Tax Rate Changes — During 2009, the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which resulted in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. During 2010, our current state tax rate increased from 6.25% to 6.75% resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of $5 million. In addition, our state deferred income taxes increased $37 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized. During 2009, our current state tax rate increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our deferred state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 5.75%, resulting in an increase to our income taxes of $3 million and $6 million, respectively. During 2008, our current state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 6.0%, resulting in an increase to our income taxes of $5 million. The increases in these rates are primarily due to changes in state law. The comparison of our effective state tax rate during the reported periods has also been affected by return-to-accrual adjustments, which increased our “Provision for income taxes” in 2010 and reduced our “Provision for income taxes” in 2009 and 2008. • Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. • Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credits — Our federal low-income housing investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our federal low-income housing investment. We expect our 2011 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 35.7% based on expected income levels and additional Section 45 tax credits resulting from our investment in a refined coal facility. Specifically, in January 2011, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility. The facility’s refinement processes qualify for federal tax credits which we expect to realize through 2019 in accordance with Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Small Business Jobs Act, signed into law in September 2010, contains a tax incentive package that includes a one-year extension through 2010 of the 50 percent bonus, or accelerated, depreciation provision first enacted in 2008 and subsequently renewed in 2009. The provision had expired at the end of 2009. Under the bonus depreciation provision, 50 percent of the basis of qualified capital expenditures may be deducted in the year the 48 Table of Contents property is placed in service and the remaining 50 percent deducted under normal depreciation rules. The acceleration of deductions on 2010 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our effective tax rate. However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions did decrease our 2010 cash taxes by $60 million. Taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the accelerated deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. In addition, new tax law signed on December 17, 2010 includes an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance through the end of 2011, and increases the amount of qualifying capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from 50 percent to 100 percent. The 100 percent depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in service between September 8, 2010 and December 31, 2011. The passage of the extension of bonus depreciation is estimated to decrease our 2011 cash taxes by approximately $190 million. The cash tax benefit realized in 2011 will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the deduction for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been realized. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $49 million in 2010, $66 million in 2009 and $41 million in 2008. In each period, these amounts have been principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group. However the comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has been affected by (i) our January 2010 acquisition of a controlling financial interest in a portable self-storage business and (ii) the deconsolidation of certain capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts as a result of our implementation of authoritative accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2010, associated with variable interest entities. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2010 and we owned or operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Remaining cubic yards 4,793 600 5,393 4,546 739 5,285 Remaining tonnage 4,391 603 4,994 4,075 726 4,801 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2010 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 40 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 33 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 49 Table of Contents The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2010, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 12 7 34 70 87 210 Operated through lease(a) 5 5 4 3 9 26 Operating contracts(b) 10 5 11 4 5 35 Total landfills 27 17 49 77 101 271 (a) From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance, beginning of year 4,075 726 4,801 3,979 794 4,773 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 14 — 14 33 — 33 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 120 120 — 83 83 Expansion permits granted(b) 238 (238 ) — 129 (129 ) — Airspace consumed (91 ) — (91 ) (92 ) — (92 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 155 (5 ) 150 26 (22 ) 4 Balance, end of year 4,391 603 4,994 4,075 726 4,801 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at 13 of our landfills during 2010 and ten of our landfills during 2009, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of 50 Table of Contents airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2010 and 2009 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2010 2009 # of Total Tons # of Total Tons Sites Tons per Day Sites Tons per Day Solid waste landfills 266 (a) 91,863 336 268 91,901 337 Hazardous waste landfills 5 667 2 5 1,026 4 271 92,530 338 273 92,927 341 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 3 295 4 328 92,825 (b) 93,255 (b) (a) In 2010, we developed one landfill, closed two landfills and our contract expired at one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.7 million tons at December 31, 2010 and 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2009 that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2010, our closed sites management group managed 202 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2010 (in millions): Accumulated Cost Basis of Landfill Airspace Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2009 $ 12,301 $ (6,448 ) $ 5,853 Capital additions 428 — 428 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 47 — 47 Acquisitions — — — Amortization of landfill airspace — (372 ) (372 ) Foreign currency translation 70 (19 ) 51 Asset retirements and other adjustments (69 ) 47 (22 ) December 31, 2010 $ 12,777 $ (6,792 ) $ 5,985 As of December 31, 2010, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2011, and approximately $1 billion in 2012 and 2013 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to 51 Table of Contents change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations, and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2010 (in millions): Environmental Landfill Remediation December 31, 2009 $ 1,267 $ 256 Obligations incurred and capitalized 47 — Obligations settled (86 ) (36 ) Interest accretion 82 5 Revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions (49 ) 61 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 5 (2 ) December 31, 2010 $ 1,266 $ 284 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 82 $ 80 $ 77 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 8 (30 ) 41 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 64 69 69 Landfill remediation costs 63 23 17 Other landfill site costs 77 80 87 Total landfill operating costs $ 294 $ 222 $ 291 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Additionally, in 2010, we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects. As these remediation projects progressed, more defined reclamation plans were developed, resulting in an increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies. 52 Table of Contents Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 372 $ 358 $ 429 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 91 92 107 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.08 $ 3.90 $ 4.01 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 271 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill capping, closure and post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was reduced by $13 million in 2010, $14 million in 2009 and $3 million in 2008, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of capping events that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred capping costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations; and (vii) investments and acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments and share repurchases. 53 Table of Contents Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 539 $ 1,140 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 124 $ 231 Tax-exempt bond funds 14 65 Other 8 10 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 146 $ 306 Debt: Current portion $ 233 $ 749 Long-term portion 8,674 8,124 Total debt $ 8,907 $ 8,873 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 79 $ 91 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. The year-over-year decrease in our cash balances is largely attributable to our November 2009 senior note issuance. We used a significant portion of the proceeds of this debt issuance to fund investments and acquisitions during the first half of 2010, including (i) our acquisition of a waste-to-energy facility in Portsmouth, Virginia for $150 million and (ii) our purchase of a 40% equity investment in SEG, a subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd., for $142 million. Pending application of the offering proceeds as described, we temporarily invested the proceeds in money market funds, which were reflected as cash equivalents in our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of (i) funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations; and (ii) funds received from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The decrease in capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds from December 31, 2009 is due to our implementation of revised accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. Effective January 1, 2010, we were required to deconsolidate trusts for which power over significant activities is shared, which reduced our restricted trust and escrow accounts by $109 million. Beginning in 2010, our interests in these variable interest entities were accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are recorded in “Other receivables” and as long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The decrease in tax-exempt bond funds is attributable to reimbursements distributed to us by the trust funds for approved construction and equipment expenditures and to a decrease in new tax-exempt borrowings. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2010 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 can primarily be attributed to (i) $908 million of cash borrowings, including $592 million in net proceeds from the June 2010 issuance of $600 million of senior notes; (ii) the cash repayment of $1,112 million of outstanding borrowings at 54 Table of Contents their scheduled maturities, including the repayment of $600 million of senior notes in August 2010 and; (iii) our investment in an entity that invests in and manages federal low-income housing projects, which increased our debt obligation by $215 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had (i) $502 million of debt maturing within twelve months, including U.S.$212 million under our Canadian credit facility and $147 million of 7.65% senior notes that mature in March 2011; and (ii) $405 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months. The amount reported as the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 excludes $674 million of these amounts because we have the intent and ability to refinance portions of our current maturities on a long-term basis. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2010 2009 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 1,138 $ 1,578 Letter of credit facilities(b) 505 371 Other(c) 237 173 $ 1,880 $ 2,122 (a) In June 2010, we entered into a three-year, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, replacing the $2.4 billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in August 2011. At December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings and $1,138 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility. The unused and available credit capacity was $862 million at December 31, 2010. (b) As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $505 million under letter of credit facilities with maturities that extend from June 2013 to June 2015. As of December 31, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding under these letter of credit facilities and we had no unused or available credit capacity. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. The decrease in the utilization of the revolving credit facility and the increase in the utilization of our letter of credit and other facilities is due to the significantly higher costs associated with the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that was executed in June 2010. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,275 $ 2,362 $ 2,575 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,606 ) $ (1,250 ) $ (1,183 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,273 ) $ (457 ) $ (1,256 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: • Increase in earnings — Our income from operations increased by $229 million on a year-over-year basis, driven, in part, by a favorable cash benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in April 2010. This earnings increase was also impacted by (i) the recognition of a $51 million non-cash charge during the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the abandonment of licensed revenue management software and (ii) the recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in California. 55 Table of Contents The comparison of our 2010 and 2009 income from operations was also affected by a $91 million increase in non-cash charges attributable to (i) equity-based compensation expense; (ii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities; (iii) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets; (iv) depreciation and amortization; and (v) the impact of the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer pension plans. While the increase in non-cash charges unfavorably affected our earnings comparison, there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was negatively impacted in 2010 and favorably impacted in 2009, by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Additionally, the following are other significant items that affected our cash flow from operations: • Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $86 million higher on a year-over-year basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. • Increased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $61 million higher on a year-over-year basis. This increase is primarily due to (i) the issuance of an additional $600 million of senior notes in November 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010; (ii) significantly higher costs related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility, which was refinanced in June 2010; and (iii) a decrease in benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding. • Settlement of Canadian hedge — In December 2010, our previously existing foreign currency hedges matured and we paid cash of $37 million upon settlement. The cash payment from the settlement has been classified as a change in accrued liabilities within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Liquidation of a foreign subsidiary — We received a $65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. The cash proceeds have been classified as a change in other current assets within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: • Decrease in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $419 million on a year-over-year basis. However, this earnings decline was also impacted by (i) the recognition of a $51 million non-cash charge during the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the abandonment of licensed revenue management software and (ii) the recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of a landfill in California. Further, approximately $55 million of the year-over-year decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets.” The comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was also affected by an $86 million decrease in non-cash charges attributable to (i) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets; (ii) equity-based compensation expense; and (iii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities. While the decrease in non-cash charges favorably affected our earnings comparison, there is no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. • Change in receivables — There was a significant decrease in the operating cash flows provided by changes in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, when comparing 2009 with 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to unusual activity in 2008, including (i) the significant decrease in 56 Table of Contents sequential quarter revenues when comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 with the third quarter of 2008, which was driven by the decline in the demand and market prices for recyclable commodities; and (ii) the collection of a $60 million outstanding receivable related to our investments in synthetic fuel production facilities that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007. • Decreased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $140 million lower on a year-over-year basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. • Decreased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $60 million lower on a year-over-year basis. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in market interest rates, which (i) increased the benefits to our interest costs provided by our active interest rate swap agreements and (ii) reduced the interest costs associated with our variable-rate tax-exempt debt. • Decreased bonus payments — Employee bonus payments earned in 2008, which were paid in the first quarter of 2009, were lower than the bonus payments earned in 2007 but paid in 2008 due to the relative strength of our financial performance against incentive measures in 2007 as compared with 2008. The year-over-year decrease in cash bonuses favorably affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $35 million. • Termination of interest rate swaps — In December 2009, we elected to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350 million that were scheduled to mature in November 2012. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $20 million in cash for their fair value plus accrued interest receivable. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in other assets within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Accounts payable processes — Changes in our accounts payable balances have favorably impacted our year-over-year cash flow from operations change by approximately $20 million. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions increased from $280 million and $281 million during 2008 and 2009, respectively, to $407 million in 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, we paid approximately $150 million to acquire a waste-to-energy facility in Portsmouth, Virginia. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. • Capital expenditures — We used $1,104 million during 2010 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,179 million in 2009 and $1,221 million in 2008. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $48 million to our investing activities in 2010 compared with $196 million in 2009 and $178 million in 2008. The significant decrease in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2010 is due to a decrease in tax-exempt borrowings. • Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $173 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2010. These cash investments were primarily related to a $142 million payment made to acquire a 40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, a subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd. As a joint venture partner in SEG, we will participate in the operation and management of waste-to-energy and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG will also focus on building new waste-to-energy facilities in China. 57 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases and dividend payments — Our 2010, 2009 and 2008 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $501 million for share repurchases in 2010, compared with $226 million in 2009 and $410 million in 2008. We repurchased approximately 15 million, 7 million and 12 million shares of our common stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in share repurchases during 2009 is largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in July 2008 in connection with a proposed acquisition and to the state of the financial markets and the economy. Given the stabilization of the capital markets and economic conditions, we elected to resume our share repurchases during the third quarter of 2009. We paid an aggregate of $604 million in cash dividends during 2010, compared with $569 million in 2009 and $531 million in 2008. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.27 in 2008, to $0.29 in 2009 and to $0.315 in 2010, and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. In December 2010, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.34 per share for dividends declared in 2011. All 2011 share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, up to $575 million, as approved by the Board of Directors in December 2010, and all actual future dividends must first be declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion, with all decisions dependent on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future acquisitions and investments and other factors deemed relevant. • Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options— The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $54 million of financing cash inflows during 2010 compared with $20 million during 2009 and $37 million in 2008. • Net debt repayments — Net debt repayments were $204 million in 2010, net debt borrowings were $414 million in 2009 and net debt repayments were $260 million in 2008. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility $ — $ — $ 350 Canadian credit facility 316 364 581 Senior notes 592 1,385 594 $ 908 $ 1,749 $ 1,525 Repayments: Revolving credit facility $ — $ (310 ) $ (371 ) Canadian credit facility (372 ) (395 ) (634 ) Senior notes (600 ) (500 ) (633 ) Tax exempt bonds (52 ) (65 ) (19 ) Tax exempt project bonds (39 ) (39 ) (67 ) Capital leases and other debt (49 ) (26 ) (61 ) $ (1,112 ) $ (1,335 ) $ (1,785 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ (204 ) $ 414 $ (260 ) This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and debt repayments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we had a $215 million non-cash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the 58 Table of Contents issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. This investment is discussed in detail in Note 9. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, these non-cash financing activities were primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings. Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds, were $105 million in 2009 and $169 million in 2008. • Other — Net cash provided by other financing activities was $18 million in 2010 while net cash used in other financing activities was $50 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2008. These activities are primarily attributable to changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances due to the timing of cash deposits or payments. The cash provided by these activities in 2010 was offset, in part, by $13 million of financing costs paid to execute our new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Capping, closure and post-closure $ 105 $ 116 $ 96 $ 102 $ 107 $ 1,943 $ 2,469 Environmental remediation 43 37 21 30 24 141 296 148 153 117 132 131 2,084 2,765 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 511 614 203 459 452 6,600 8,839 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 82 76 62 51 40 215 526 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 85 84 58 21 16 238 502 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2010 $ 826 $ 927 $ 440 $ 663 $ 639 $ 9,137 $ 12,632 (a) Environmental liabilities include capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010 include $405 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 59 Table of Contents (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. Liquidity Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions As discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2010 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2010, over 35% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — In October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption. We do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to the extent they are material. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2010, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. 60 Table of Contents Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2010, we had $8.8 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $1.8 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2011. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $500 million of “receive fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixed-rate senior notes; (ii) $611 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to re-pricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (iii) $405 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within twelve months; and (iv) $215 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, the effective interest rates of approximately $3.0 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months. The decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable interest rates in 2010 is generally a result of a $600 million decrease in the notional amount of active interest rate swaps and decreases in our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds. The decline in our variable-rate debt obligations has reduced the potential volatility to our operating results and cash flows that results from fluctuations in market interest rates. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2011 interest expense by approximately $13 million. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we have forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $525 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $658 million at December 31, 2010. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including aluminum, old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets where we operate. With the exception of electricity commodity derivatives, which are discussed below, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended December 31, 2010. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. During 2010, approximately 47% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently expect that nearly 54% of our electricity revenues at our waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2011. Our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased because several long-term power purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that medium- and long-term electricity contracts are less favorable in the current environment. As we renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our waste-to-energy facilities and landfill gas-to-energy plants will be based on current market rates. Accordingly, in 2010 we implemented a more 61 Table of Contents actively managed energy program, which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives. Currency Rate Exposure — From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives. 62 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:45:03.310405
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this report. Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Solid Waste $ 13,449 $ 13,477 $ 13,056 Wheelabrator 817 845 846 Other 2,191 2,185 2,106 Intercompany (2,461 ) (2,524 ) (2,359 ) Total $ 13,996 $ 13,983 $ 13,649 The services we currently provide include collection, landfill (solid and hazardous waste landfills), transfer, recycling and resource recovery and other services, as described below. Prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014, we provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. The following table shows revenues (in millions) contributed by these services for each of the three years presented: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Collection $ 8,507 $ 8,513 $ 8,405 Landfill 2,849 2,790 2,685 Transfer 1,353 1,329 1,296 Wheelabrator 817 845 846 Recycling 1,370 1,447 1,360 Other 1,561 1,583 1,416 Intercompany (2,461 ) (2,524 ) (2,359 ) Total $ 13,996 $ 13,983 $ 13,649 Collection. Our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station, material recovery facility (“MRF”) or disposal site. We generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements: • For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the agreements are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection 5 Table of Contents equipment we furnish, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel containers to most customers to store their solid waste between pick-up dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one employee. • For most residential collection services, we have a contract with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of three to six years. We also provide services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to households. The fees for residential collection are either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service. Landfill. Landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2014, we owned or operated 247 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills, which represents the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations during its design, construction, operation and closure. The operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace. All solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, as a result, third-party haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited. Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers. Transfer. At December 31, 2014, we owned or operated 298 transfer stations in North America. We deposit waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites. Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of 6 Table of Contents the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors. The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks, railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites. The transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties. There are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station. Wheelabrator. On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years. Wheelabrator provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Wheelabrator owns or operates 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants. Prior to the sale, our Wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment, as discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We concluded that the sale of our Wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the long-term waste supply agreements referred to above and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recycling. Our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage. In 2001, we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential single-stream recycling, which allows customers to mix recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin. Residential single-stream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates. Single-stream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies. We have also been advancing the single-stream recycling programs for commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include the following: Materials processing — Through our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our MRFs for processing. We operate 126 MRFs where paper, cardboard, metals, plastics, glass, construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale. Plastics materials recycling — Using state-of-the-art sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient. Commodities recycling — We market and resell recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands and product quality. 7 Table of Contents Recycling brokerage services — We also provide recycling brokerage services, which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties. The experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties. Utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers, we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements. We also provide electronics recycling. We recycle discarded computers, communications equipment, and other electronic equipment. Services include the collection, sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials. In recent years, we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “take-back” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner. Some of the recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are purchased from various sources, including third parties and our own operations. The price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate.” Rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods, market conditions and transportation costs, but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers, which are recorded as “Operating expenses” within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In recent years, we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell. Other. Other services we provide include the following: Although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services, our strategic accounts program, which is managed by our Strategic Business Solutions organization, works with customers whose locations span the United States. Our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs. Our Energy and Environmental Services organization offers our customers in all Areas a variety of services in collaboration with our Area and strategic accounts programs, including (i) construction and remediation services; (ii) services associated with the disposal of fly ash, residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks; (iii) in-plant services, where our employees work full-time inside our customers’ facilities to provide full-service waste management solutions and consulting services; this service is managed through our Energy and Environmental Services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and (iv) specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations; revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business. Our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate, identifying recycling opportunities, determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly. We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our WM Renewable Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. The EPA endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At December 31, 2014, we had 134 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 123 of our solid waste landfills and four third-party landfills. At 107 of these landfills, the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or power cooperatives. At 16 landfills, the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At 8 Table of Contents 10 landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers. At one landfill, the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel. We continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations. These investments include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership interests. The solutions and services include the collection of project waste, including construction debris and household or yard waste, through our Bagster® program; the development, operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities; operation of a landfill gas-to-liquid natural gas plant; solar powered trash compactors; and organic waste-to-fuel conversion technology. We also offer portable self-storage services through a joint venture; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let®; and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. Competition We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition in our Solid Waste business based on pricing and quality of service. We have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste. Seasonal Trends Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Through 2014, the operating results of our first quarter also often reflected higher repair and maintenance expenses because, prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we relied on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. 9 Table of Contents Employees At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 39,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,000 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations. Approximately 8,500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations Financial Assurance Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting variable-rate tax-exempt debt and (iii) estimated final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity. Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Guaranty Insurance Company of Vermont, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our behalf. Letters of credit generally are supported by our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and other credit facilities established for that purpose. Insurance We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy carried self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2014, our auto liability insurance program included a per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to additional deductibles of $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million layer. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2014 are summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers directors and officers directly for loss, including defense costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company, as the Company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers. Regulation Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the United States and Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of 10 Table of Contents violations. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a management or disposal facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage. The primary United States federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below: • The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991, the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations. • The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (“CERCLA”) which is also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional release of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations to a potentially responsible party, or PRP, that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations. • The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water runoff that require landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain 11 Table of Contents storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions. • The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and emission guidelines (“EG”) controlling landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for municipal solid waste landfills subject to the NSPS. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on- or off-site. The EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Defense Fund to evaluate the 1996 NSPS for new landfills as required by the Clean Air Act every eight years and revise them if deemed necessary. The EPA published a proposed NSPS rule July 17, 2014 and plans to finalize this rule by March 31, 2015. Where we identified potential for increased capital and operating expenses, we provided formal comment and technical support to the EPA to minimize the impact to our operations. We expect the EPA will address our comments in the final rule. Where the EPA does not address our comments in the final rule, we will re-assess the capital and operating cost impact to our operations. The EPA also plans to propose an EG rule for existing landfills by March 31, 2015 and finalize this rule by March 2016. Should the EPA adopt more stringent requirements, capital expenditures and operating costs may increase. However, we do not believe that the regulatory changes would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. Additionally, emission and fuel economy standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles). The EPA continues to evaluate and develop regulations to increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions; such regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet, but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. • The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, (“OSHA”) establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. We are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in United States federal regulations affecting our business: • In 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. 12 Table of Contents In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that significantly limited the applicability and scope of EPA permitting requirements for GHGs from stationary sources, concluding that: the EPA may not treat GHGs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is required to obtain a PSD or Title V permit; and the EPA can continue to require that PSD permits otherwise required based on emissions of conventional pollutants contain limitations on GHG emissions based on Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”). Following this ruling, the EPA issued a policy memorandum advising that it intends to propose exempting biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from waste-derived feedstocks (municipal solid waste and landfill gas) from PSD and Title V air permitting. The EPA anticipates basing this proposal on the rationale that those emissions are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions, or even reduce such impacts, when compared to an alternate method of disposal. As a result of this U.S. Supreme Court ruling and EPA policy action, the potential impact of the PSD and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule on our air permits, compliance and results of operations is significantly reduced. Other recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards, such as the Ozone rule proposed in December 2014, and related PSD increment/significance thresholds could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. At December 31, 2014, we had 134 projects at solid waste landfills where landfill gas was captured and utilized for its renewable energy value rather than flared. Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls, with associated capital or operating costs; however, we do not believe that such regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate.” The EPA recently clarified in its November 2014 policy memorandum that states may rely on waste-derived biogenic feedstocks in their future proposed compliance plans required by the proposed Clean Power Plan rules. This recognition by the EPA may create new or expanded opportunities for renewable energy projects. We are taking steps to anticipate the future needs of our customers which include investing in and developing ever-more-advanced recycling and reuse technologies. Potential climate change and GHG regulatory initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide low-carbon services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. If the U.S. were to impose a carbon tax or other form of GHG regulation increasing demand for low-carbon service offerings in the future, the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable. • In 2011, the EPA published the Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials (“NHSM”) Rule, which provides the standards and procedures for identifying whether NHSM are solid waste under RCRA when used as fuels or ingredients in combustion units. The EPA also published new source performance standards and emission guidelines for commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units, and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards for commercial and industrial boilers. The EPA published clarifications and amendments to these rules in 2013, and there is litigation surrounding the rules. Although the recently published amendments are generally favorable to our industry, some of the potential regulatory interpretations are undergoing review and other regulatory outcomes may be dependent on case-by-case administrative determinations. These could have a significant impact on some of our projects in which we are seeking to convert biomass or other secondary materials into products, fuels or energy. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these rulemakings or pending administrative determinations at the present time. However, we believe the rules and administrative determinations will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole and are more likely to facilitate our efforts to reuse or recover energy value from secondary material streams. 13 Table of Contents • In December 2014, the EPA issued a final rule regulating the disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion residuals (“CCR”). The regulations encourage beneficial use of CCR in encapsulated uses (e.g., used in cement or wallboard), and use according to established industry standards (e.g., application of sludge for agricultural enrichment). The EPA also deemed disposal and beneficial use of CCR at permitted municipal solid waste landfills exempt from the new regulations because the RCRA Subtitle D standards applicable at municipal solid waste landfills provide at least equivalent protection. The new standards are consistent with our approach to handling CCR at our sites currently, and we believe the new standards will provide a potential growth opportunity for the Company. States may impose standards more stringent than the federal program, and we will be monitoring state implementation to determine impact. State, Provincial and Local Regulations There are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements. Our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills. The number of cities with food waste recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of food waste recycling remain challenging. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the 14 Table of Contents applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Foreign Import Regulation Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. Despite these increased costs, we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations. We are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly. Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation Our Energy Services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas, as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. On the other hand, we believe the size, capital structure, regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our Company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services. Emissions from Natural Gas Fueling and Infrastructure We currently operate the largest compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fleet in the waste industry, and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. We have constructed and operate 72 natural gas fueling stations, 25 of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties, in 28 states and three Canadian provinces. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. We have partnered with the environmental organization Environmental Defense Fund, as well as other heavy-duty equipment users and experts, on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers. We anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavy-duty fleet may ultimately result in regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our current plan to continue transitioning to CNG vehicles. 15 Table of Contents Federal, State and Local Climate Change Initiatives In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity. We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing: • projections about accounting and finances; • plans and objectives for the future; • projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or • our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance. You should view these statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2015 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the Company. The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that 16 Table of Contents specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively-bid contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. When this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business. If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected. Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview for more information on our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following: • Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. • We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively. • In efforts to enhance our revenues, we have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we have continued our fuel surcharge program to offset fuel costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. • We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result. • Our restructuring may not achieve and/or maintain the goals and cost savings intended. • Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets. • Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions. • Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others. • Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. • Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans. 17 Table of Contents • We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Compliance with existing or future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures. Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as: • limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities; • limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; • limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; • mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or • limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations. We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals. 18 Table of Contents Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility, or EPR, are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. If Operation Green Fence or other similar initiatives or new regulations increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices. Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities, particularly demand from Chinese paper mills, can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively, such as we experienced in 2014, 2013 and 2012. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The decline in market prices in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $53 million, $79 million and $428 million, respectively. Additionally, our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers. Therefore, even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our Energy Services business. Demand for these services may decrease if drilling activity slows due to changes in oil and gas prices, such as the pronounced recent price decreases. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future. 19 Table of Contents Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our Energy Services business. Energy Services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas, as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills or waste-to-energy facilities. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or waste-to-energy facility, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested waste-to-energy facilities, have historically provided our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives. Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities and our profitability. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives. If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer. Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies. Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may 20 Table of Contents negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which: • agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and • local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments. 21 Table of Contents Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results. We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we had $501 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $638 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months. If the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, 22 Table of Contents or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses. The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Average diesel fuel prices decreased in both 2014 and 2013 but increased in 2012. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we recently settled litigation that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we may face similar claims in the future. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins. We are expanding our compressed natural gas (“CNG”) truck fleet, which makes us increasingly dependent on the availability of CNG and CNG fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to CNG prices. We currently operate the largest CNG fleet in the waste industry, and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. However, CNG is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. Until the public and third parties in North America broadly adopt CNG, which may not be on the timetable we anticipate, it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in CNG fueling infrastructure in order to power our CNG fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of CNG could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between CNG and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in CNG vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for CNG may not effectively be recovered by this program. We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 23 Table of Contents A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage. Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions. Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans. We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and (iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan. In connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations, which result in the decline of Company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan, could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal. In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status, including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan, the ongoing solvency of participating employers, the investment returns obtained on plan assets, and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation; depending on such factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of 24 Table of Contents operations for a particular reporting period. We reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized related expenses of $4 million in 2014, $5 million in 2013 and $10 million in 2012. We are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals, which could be higher than the charges we have recognized. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, mass instability or waste slides, severe weather and natural disasters, which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials and odors, injury or death of employees and others, or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken. Additionally, we have built and are operating CNG fueling stations to serve our growing fleet of CNG trucks, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. All of these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, and property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities. The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results. In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to 25 Table of Contents obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. We may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or fail to maintain our desired credit profile. If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have $1.4 billion of debt as of December 31, 2014 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow. We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$150 million Canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2018 and November 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings and $785 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,465 million, and we had no borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. 26 Table of Contents The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate. Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and “one-time” special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. The operating results of our first quarter often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations. Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties. 27 Table of Contents Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity. We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations. Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 380,000 square feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Texas, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states. We also have operations in the District of Columbia and throughout Canada. Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with our strategic growth plans.

Cash dividends declared and paid were $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share, $683 million in 2013, or $1.46 per common share and $658 million in 2012, or $1.42 per common share. In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.375 to $0.385 per share for dividends declared in 2015. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Our share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized up to $600 million in future share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the ASR repurchase periods, we delivered the $600 million in cash and received 9.6 million shares, which represented 70% of the shares expected to be repurchased based on then-current market prices. These agreements were completed in February 2015 and we received approximately 2.8 million additional shares. The final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed ASR agreements was $48.58. We announced in February 2015 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations. 30 Table of Contents Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2014. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address, and anticipate, the current, expanding and evolving needs of our customers. Accomplishment of our goals will grow our Company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they, too, Think Green®. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Drawing on our resources and experience, we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve and the environment. We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy: to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry, to extract more value from the materials we manage, and to innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a “best cost” structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as recycling operations. In pursuit of these long-term goals, we recognize that we must grow the business, and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Accordingly, we are focusing on the following five key company priorities: • Customers: provide the best possible service to our customers; • Traditional Waste Business: continuously improve our operational performance; • Growth: take advantage of opportunities in our current business, as well as considering attractive acquisition opportunities; • Yield Management: remain focused on price leadership while considering competitive dynamics; and • Costs: minimize both operating costs and selling, general & administrative expenses. We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry. Notable items of our 2014 financial results include: • Revenues of $13,996 million in 2014 compared with $13,983 million in 2013, an increase of $13 million. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) positive revenue growth from 32 Table of Contents yield on our collection and disposal operations of $262 million, or 2.3%, and (ii) revenue from acquired operations, particularly the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which increased revenues by $77 million. Substantially offsetting these increases were (i) lower volumes which decreased our revenues by $188 million; (ii) divestitures of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets as well as the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business, which decreased our revenues by $90 million and (iii) foreign currency translation of $61 million related to our Canadian operations; • Operating expenses of $9,002 million in 2014, or 64.3% of revenues, compared with $9,112 million, or 65.2% of revenues, in 2013. This decrease of $110 million is largely driven by our decline in collection volumes and divestitures, both of which affect several of our operating expense categories, particularly labor costs, transfer and disposal costs, and fuel costs; • Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,481 million in 2014, or 10.6% of revenues, compared with $1,468 million, or 10.5% of revenues, in 2013. This increase of $13 million is driven mainly by higher litigation settlements; • Restructuring costs of $82 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013. The 2014 restructuring charges relate to the consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions. We anticipate saving in excess of $100 million annually from these actions when fully implemented in 2015; • Income from operations of $2,299 million, or 16.4% of revenues, in 2014 compared with $1,079 million, or 7.7% of revenues, in 2013, the increase of which is primarily attributable to the $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and impairment charges of $355 million recognized in 2014 compared to impairment charges of $981 million recognized in 2013 discussed below; • Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,298 million, or $2.79 per diluted share for 2014, as compared with $98 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for 2013, the increase of which is primarily attributable to the increase in income from operations discussed above; and • In 2014, we returned $1,293 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $922 million in 2013. The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2014 results with 2013 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2014 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of net pre-tax gains of $515 million, which includes the $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business. These items had a positive impact of $1.10 on our diluted earnings per share; • Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $420 million primarily related to (i) $272 million of charges to impair our oil and gas producing properties; (ii) $69 million of charges to impair investments related to waste diversion technology companies; (iii) $31 million of litigation settlements; (iv) $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations; and (v) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values related to certain of our operations. These items had a negative impact of $0.68 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges of $82 million, which had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share. The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2013 results with 2012 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2013 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $1.0 billion, primarily related to (i) a $483 million charge to impair goodwill associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $262 million of charges to 33 Table of Contents impair certain landfills, primarily in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) $144 million of charges to write down the carrying value of three waste-to-energy facilities and (iv) $71 million of impairment charges relating to investments in waste diversion technology companies. These items had a negative impact of $1.91 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $23 million primarily related to our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI as well as our 2012 restructuring and other charges. These items had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2012 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $109 million attributable primarily to facilities in our medical waste services business and investments in waste diversion technologies. These items had a negative impact of $0.17 on our diluted earnings per share; • The recognition of pre-tax costs aggregating $82 million primarily related to our July 2012 restructuring as well as integration costs associated with our acquisition of Oakleaf. These items had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share; The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $10 million related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and a pre-tax charge of $6 million resulting from a labor union dispute. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $10 million related to an accrual for legal reserves and the impact of a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our environmental remediation liabilities. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share. We began the year with a focus on growing earnings and free cash flow, increasing yield and exercising discipline around capital spending and costs, and the Company’s execution on these goals translated into strong overall operating results in 2014. Additionally, we increased the amount we returned to stockholders in 2014 compared to 2013 by increasing our dividend and share repurchases. Our fourth quarter results capitalized on the momentum we built throughout the year, delivering growth in income from operations and income from operations margin in our Solid Waste business that we expect to continue into 2015. During the fourth quarter, we also completed our previously announced divestiture of our Wheelabrator business for cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We intend to use these proceeds in support of our strategic growth plans to drive long-term stockholder value, with our priority being on making accretive acquisitions in our Solid Waste business. We also expect our focus on our five key priorities set forth above — Customers; Traditional Waste Business; Growth; Yield Management and Costs – to translate into continued strong free cash flow to pay our dividends, repurchase shares and make other growth investments, while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. 34 Table of Contents Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,331 $ 2,455 $ 2,295 Capital expenditures (1,151 ) (1,271 ) (1,510 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) 2,253 138 44 Free cash flow $ 3,433 $ 1,322 $ 829 When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable period in 2013, the decrease of $124 million is primarily related to higher income tax payments of $247 million in the current year and a payment of $36 million made in the first quarter of 2014 to terminate our forward starting swaps. These decreases were partially offset by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital changes. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period in 2012, the increase of $160 million was primarily related to the impact of higher cash earnings, favorable impacts of working capital changes and the payment of $59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in September 2012. The increase was partially offset by an increase in tax payments of $145 million and the favorable cash receipt of $72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in April 2012. The decrease in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable period in 2013 and comparing the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period in 2012 can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management. The increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the comparable period in 2013 is largely driven by (i) the sale of our Wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for $1.95 billion; (ii) the sale of our investment in Shanghai Environment Group (“SEG”), which was part of our Wheelabrator business, in the first quarter of 2014 for $155 million; (iii) the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014, for proceeds of $80 million, including $65 million in cash; (iv) the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014 for $39 million and (v) the sale of a vacant facility in the second quarter of 2014 for $19 million. Pending Acquisition On September 17, 2014, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc., one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest. Closing of the acquisition is expected to occur in early 2015, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Acquisitions Greenstar, LLC — On January 31, 2013, we paid $170 million inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Greenstar, LLC (“Greenstar”). Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, up to an additional $40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018, of which $20 million is guaranteed. The remaining $20 million of this consideration is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and 35 Table of Contents had an estimated fair value at closing of $16 million. Greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions, having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers. RCI Environnement, Inc. — On July 5, 2013, we paid C$509 million, or $481 million, to acquire substantially all of the assets of RCI Environnement, Inc. (“RCI”), the largest waste management company in Quebec, and certain related entities. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, was C$515 million, or $487 million. RCI provides collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec. Divestitures Divestiture of Wheelabrator Business On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years. Wheelabrator provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Wheelabrator owns or operates 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants. Prior to the sale, our Wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment for the Company, as discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We concluded that the sale of our Wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the long-term waste supply agreements referred to above and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Divestitures In the second quarter of 2014, we sold our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets which were included in Tier 3 and Tier 1, respectively, of our Solid Waste business. We received proceeds from the sale of $80 million, consisting of $65 million of cash and $15 million of preferred stock and recognized a loss on the sale of $25 million. In the third quarter of 2014, we sold certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area, which were included in Tier 3. We received cash proceeds from the sale of $39 million and recognized a gain of $18 million. The gain or loss on these divestitures is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining proceeds from divestitures in 2014 were comprised substantially of cash. Additional information on our reportable segments can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Comprehensive Income — In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to provide 36 Table of Contents information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Additionally, companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. The amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the Company on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have presented the information required by this amendment in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing — In July 2012, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. The amendments were effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final 37 Table of Contents capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and • Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 23 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2014, five landfills required the 38 Table of Contents Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Two of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining three landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, 39 Table of Contents considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below. Landfills — The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Expansion Airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. 40 Table of Contents At December 31, 2014, one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the expansion permit is probable, is not currently accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for this site was $247 million at December 31, 2014. We performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying value of this site. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the reported periods. Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill for impairment using Level 3 inputs. We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units. 41 Table of Contents During our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our Wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $483 million, which had no related tax benefit. We estimated the implied fair value of our Wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches. Because the annual impairment test indicated that Wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, we performed the “step two” analysis. In the “step two” analysis, the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, power contracts, customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. The factors contributing to the $483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which Wheelabrator operated, characterized by lower available disposal volumes (which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue, as well as the amount of electricity Wheelabrator was able to generate), lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as Wheelabrator’s facilities aged. These factors caused us to lower prior assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue, and increase assumed operating costs. Additionally, the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates. In 2013, we incurred an additional $10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with our Puerto Rico operations and $4 million to impair goodwill associated with our recycling business. In 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Goodwill Impairments and Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 42 Table of Contents Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues set forth below have generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. Our recently divested Wheelabrator business provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste or Wheelabrator businesses, including Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”), Energy and Environmental Services, recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services, landfill gas-to-energy services, and expanded service offerings and solutions. We also offer portable self-storage services through a joint venture; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let® and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below.

(b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related-business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by 44 Table of Contents market-driven price changes in commodities.

Our revenues increased $13 million, or 0.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenue fluctuation in the current period has been driven by (i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (ii) revenue from acquired operations, particularly the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which contributed approximately $77 million to the revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2014; and (iii) fluctuations in electricity prices at Wheelabrator’s merchant waste-to-energy facilities that favorably affected revenues. Offsetting these revenue increases were (i) revenue declines due to lower volumes; (ii) divestitures, primarily our Puerto Rico divestiture in the second quarter of 2014, certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014, and our Wheelabrator business in December 2014; (iii) foreign currency translation, which affects revenues from our Canadian operations; and (iv) revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices. Our revenues increased $334 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our revenue fluctuation in the prior period was driven by (i) revenue from acquired operations, particularly Greenstar acquired in January 2013 and RCI, which increased revenues by $138 million and $80 million, respectively; (ii) increased revenue growth from our collection and disposal average yield; (iii) higher revenues provided by 45 Table of Contents our fuel surcharge program; and (iv) fluctuations in electricity prices at our merchant waste-to-energy facilities. Offsetting these revenue increases were (i) revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices; (ii) foreign currency translation, which negatively affected revenues from our Canadian operations; and (iii) revenue declines due to lower volumes. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $262 million, or 2.3%, and $235 million, or 2.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2014 and 2013. The details are as follows (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2014 vs. 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange2013 vs. 2012 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Commercial $ 134 4.3 % $ 101 3.3 % Industrial 84 4.2 88 4.5 Residential 32 1.3 43 1.8 $ 250 $ 232 Our year-over-year yield growth in both 2014 and 2013 was driven largely by our pricing strategy that combines focused effort on price increases with lower rollbacks. Conversely, our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy, with more significant volume declines during 2014. However, our pricing strategy and our focus on controlling variable costs have consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business, although we have seen margin deterioration in our residential line of business throughout 2014. Other drivers affecting the current period average yield include: • A fee instituted in April 2013 to help us recover a portion of the significant regulatory costs and fees, such as host fees and disposal taxes, which have not been recouped by our pricing programs. Revenues generated from this fee are approximately $97 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally in our collection business, with the most significant impact in our commercial line of business. • Revenue growth from yield in our industrial line of business was aided by our Energy Services business, which typically has higher average rates due to extended transportation distances, special waste handling costs and higher disposal costs as compared with our typical industrial business. • Our focus on bidding on residential contracts to improve our yield performance and increase our overall returns. Our effort to increase yield in our residential line of business is a challenge principally due to a very competitive environment. A high percentage of our residential business is in municipal franchise markets, and many municipalities are facing significant budget challenges, which results in increased competition on the basis of price as we rebid contracts and try to win new contracts. 46 Table of Contents • Yield growth from our landfill and transfer station operations also improved slightly for both 2014 and 2013. Recycling commodities — Decreases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sell resulted in revenue declines of $53 million and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with the same prior year period. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $2 million and increased $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. We experienced a fuel price decline of approximately 2.4% in 2014, which caused a slight decrease in our fuel surcharge revenues. These revenues increased in 2013 resulting from a revision of the surcharge calculation implemented to better capture price increases intended to be recovered by the surcharge. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. Volume — Declines in our volume caused our revenue to decrease $188 million, or 1.4%, and $133 million, or 1.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, as compared with prior year periods, driven primarily by declines in our collection business. Our volume fluctuations are generally attributable to economic conditions, pricing changes, competition and diversion of waste by customers. Our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy. We are experiencing volume declines due to the loss of low margin customers that we are not willing to keep at current rates. Additionally, we are experiencing losses of certain municipal contracts that are up for bid. As a result of both the very competitive environment and our focus on reasonable returns, we continue to face challenges to keep existing contracts and to win new contracts. Finally, we experienced revenue declines associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization. Other drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for the periods presented include: • We experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in our material recovery facilities in 2014 primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets. Revenue increased due to higher volumes in 2013 driven by additional recycling capacity that we added in 2012. • We experienced revenue declines of approximately $23 million associated with the severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014. • We experienced higher landfill volumes in both comparable periods primarily driven by our municipal solid waste business. In addition, higher special waste volumes in the Southern U.S. also contributed to our higher landfill volumes in 2014. • We experienced revenue increases due to higher volumes in our ancillary services, primarily driven by increases in our Energy and Environmental Services, our WM Renewable Energy Program and our portable self-storage services in 2014. Acquisitions and Divestitures — Revenues increased $124 million and $292 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to acquisitions. The revenue increase due to acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013 was principally associated with the RCI operations acquired in July 2013. To a lesser extent, 2013 revenues increased due to the acquisition of Greenstar in January of that year, which is reported in our “Recycling” line of business. These revenues were offset partially by revenue decreases of $90 million and $6 million due to divestitures for the years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively. The revenue decrease in 2014 is primarily due to (i) our divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014; (ii) the divestiture of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014; and (iii) the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses decreased $110 million, or 1.2%, when comparing 2014 with 2013 and increased $233 million, or 2.6%, when comparing 2013 with 2012. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 64.3% in 2014, 65.2% in 2013, and 65.1% in 2012. Divestitures — During 2014, we divested our Wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter, our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter. As mentioned above, we estimate that divestitures reduced our annual revenues by $90 million. Commensurately, we estimate our operating expenses decreased by approximately $56 million due to divestitures when compared to the prior year period. The decreases in costs were primarily in (i) labor and related benefits and (ii) maintenance and repairs. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions), with significant changes in our operating expenses discussed below: 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange 2012 Labor and related benefits $ 2,452 $ (54 ) (2.2 )% $ 2,506 $ 99 4.1 % $ 2,407 Transfer and disposal costs 935 (38 ) (3.9 ) 973 9 0.9 964 Maintenance and repairs 1,181 — — 1,181 24 2.1 1,157 Subcontractor costs 1,223 41 3.5 1,182 (8 ) (0.7 ) 1,190 Cost of goods sold 974 (26 ) (2.6 ) 1,000 81 8.8 919 Fuel 553 (50 ) (8.3 ) 603 (46 ) (7.1 ) 649 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 669 16 2.5 653 23 3.7 630 Landfill operating costs 266 34 14.7 232 8 3.6 224 Risk management 219 (25 ) (10.2 ) 244 14 6.1 230 Other 530 (8 ) (1.5 ) 538 29 5.7 509 $ 9,002 $ (110 ) (1.2 )% $ 9,112 $ 233 2.6 % $ 8,879 Labor and related benefits — The following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented. 48 Table of Contents The decrease in labor and related benefits in 2014 as compared with 2013 was due to: • Lower headcount and contract labor due to lower volumes in our collection line of business and operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business; • Lower costs resulting from recent divestitures, particularly the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations, offset in part by; • Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2013 and 2014; and • Increased health and welfare costs. The increase in labor and related benefits in 2013 as compared with 2012 was due to: • Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2013; • Higher incentive compensation expense in 2013; • Higher contract labor principally attributed to the recycling line of business; • Recent acquisitions, principally the Greenstar acquisition, offset in part by; and • Lower headcount resulting principally from the flexing of our costs in response to lower collection volumes. Maintenance and repairs — The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by (i) the Greenstar acquisition and (ii) higher internal shop labor costs due in part to higher incentive compensation and merit increases. Subcontractor costs — The increase in 2014 was driven by (i) remediation services within our Energy and Environmental Services business and (ii) the RCI operations acquired in July 2013; offset in part by the volume decline related to the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization. The decrease in 2013 was driven primarily by the volume decline associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher costs associated with the acquired RCI operations. Cost of goods sold — The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2014 is due to (i) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers; (ii) better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts; (iii) ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control and (iv) lower commodity prices. These cost decreases were offset in part by our business in portable self-storage services and remediation services. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 is due in large part to higher customer rebates resulting from higher volumes in our recycling commodity business driven primarily by the acquired Greenstar operations. Fuel — The decrease in fuel expense in both 2014 and 2013 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by (i) lower fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes; (ii) lower costs resulting from the conversion of our fleet to CNG vehicles; (iii) lower fuel prices and (iv) retroactive CNG fuel excise credits. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes— The increase in costs in both 2014 and 2013 can be attributable to (i) higher disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes and (ii) higher municipal franchise fees relating to the collection line of business. A disposal surcharge at one of our waste-to-energy facilities in 2013 affected the comparability in both periods. Landfill operating costs — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include (i) unfavorable adjustments in 2014 and 2012 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery rates and (ii) higher leachate costs for all comparable periods. 49 Table of Contents Risk management — The decrease in costs in 2014 was primarily due to lower auto and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation, claims and lower truck insurance expenses. The increase in costs in 2013 was driven principally by higher workers’ compensation claims. Other — The decrease in 2014 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of a vacant facility and lower rental costs. The increased costs in 2013 when compared to 2012 were due in part to (i) higher telecommunications costs driven by our initiative to equip our fleet with onboard computers; (ii) higher utilities; (iii) higher property taxes and (iv) lower gains on the sale of assets. These increases were offset, in part, by favorable adjustments to contingent consideration associated with acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13 million, or 0.9%, and decreased by $4 million, or 0.3%, when comparing 2014 with 2013 and 2013 with 2012, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.6% in 2014, 10.5% in 2013 and 10.8% in 2012. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange 2012 Labor and related benefits $ 933 $ 2 0.2 % $ 931 $ 81 9.5 % $ 850 Professional fees 126 (5 ) (3.8 ) 131 (32 ) (19.6 ) 163 Provision for bad debts 41 — — 41 (19 ) (31.7 ) 60 Other 381 16 4.4 365 (34 ) (8.5 ) 399 $ 1,481 $ 13 0.9 % $ 1,468 $ (4 ) (0.3 )% $ 1,472 Labor and related benefits — Factors affecting the year-over-year changes in our labor and related benefits costs include: • Merit increases; • Higher incentive compensation cost, particularly in 2013, as compared with the prior year periods, including bonuses and equity-based compensation; • Higher health and welfare costs in 2014 as compared to 2013; and • Year-over-year labor and related benefits cost savings of approximately $40 million in 2014 and $45 million in 2013 from restructuring plans implemented in 2014 and 2012. Professional fees — Our professional fees continued to decline during 2014 as a result of our concerted effort to reduce consulting fees. Our 2013 consulting fees were lower as we incurred significant fees during 2012 resulting from company-wide initiatives. The lower consulting fees were partially offset by higher legal fees in 2014 as compared to 2013. 50 Table of Contents Provision for bad debts — Our provision for bad debts decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of (i) the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our Puerto Rico operations and (ii) resolution of billing delay issues experienced during 2012 in our WMSBS organization. Other — In 2014, increased costs resulting principally from litigation settlements were partially offset by a decline in controllable costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment costs. In 2013, controllable costs associated with (i) building and equipment; (ii) advertising; (iii) computer and telecommunication; (iv) travel and entertainment and (v) seminars and education declined primarily as a result of our July 2012 restructuring and focus on cost-control initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange 2012 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 834 $ (19 ) (2.2 )% $ 853 $ 20 2.4 % $ 833 Amortization of landfill airspace 380 (20 ) (5.0 ) 400 5 1.3 395 Amortization of intangible assets 78 (2 ) (2.5 ) 80 11 15.9 69 $ 1,292 $ (41 ) (3.1 )% $ 1,333 $ 36 2.8 % $ 1,297 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates and fixed asset depreciation that was suspended when our Wheelabrator business was classified as held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in December 2014. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2013 that continued in 2014 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of RCI. Restructuring In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees have separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring, but we do not anticipate that all of these positions will be permanently eliminated. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. We do not expect to incur any material charges associated with our 2014 restructuring in future periods. 51 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a total of $18 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI and our 2012 restructurings. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. Principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including positions at both the management and support level. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a total of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $56 million were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. Goodwill Impairments During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $509 million of goodwill impairment charges, primarily related to (i) $483 million associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $10 million associated with our Puerto Rico operations and (iii) $9 million associated with a majority-owned waste diversion technology company. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $4 million related to certain of our non-Solid Waste operations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (Income) expense from divestitures $ (515 ) $ (8 ) $ — Asset impairments 345 472 79 $ (170 ) $ 464 $ 79 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $170 million, primarily related to the following: • (Income) expense from divestitures — We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. Refer to Note 19 for additional information related to our divestitures. • Oil and gas properties impairments — We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil and gas prices 52 Table of Contents in the fourth quarter of 2014. We wrote down the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value using an income approach. • Other impairments — We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized net charges of $464 million, primarily related to the following: • Landfill impairments — We recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. • Waste-to-energy impairments — We recognized $144 million of impairment charges relating to three waste-to-energy facilities, primarily as a result of closure or anticipated closure due to continued difficulty securing sufficient volumes to operate the plants at capacity and the prospect of additional capacity entering the market where the largest facility is located. We wrote down the carrying value of our facilities to their estimated fair value using a market approach. • Other impairments — The remainder of our 2013 charges were attributable to (i) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (ii) $20 million of charges to write down assets related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company and (iii) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair value. • Divestitures — Partially offsetting these charges were $8 million of net gains on divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized impairment charges of $79 million, attributable to (i) $45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities; (ii) $20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and (iii) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values, all of which are individually immaterial. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. In addition to the impairments discussed above, we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives or are underperforming. Accordingly, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become held-for-sale. 53 Table of Contents Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2014 Period-to-Period Change 2013 Period-to-Period Change 2012 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 893 $ 41 4.8 % $ 852 $ 1 0.1 % $ 851 Tier 2 1,318 27 2.1 1,291 21 1.7 1,270 Tier 3 588 297 * 291 (213 ) (42.3 ) 504 Solid Waste 2,799 365 15.0 2,434 (191 ) (7.3 ) 2,625 Wheelabrator 669 1,186 * (517 ) (630 ) * 113 Other (400 ) (229 ) * (171 ) 71 (29.3 ) (242 ) Corporate and other (769 ) (102 ) 15.3 (667 ) (22 ) 3.4 (645 ) Total $ 2,299 $ 1,220 * $ 1,079 $ (772 ) (41.7 )% $ 1,851 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Items affecting the comparability of our results of operations include (i) charges associated with our August 2014 and July 2012 restructurings; (ii) subsequent benefits realized as a result of these restructurings and ongoing cost containment efforts; (iii) increased labor costs due to merit increases effective in 2014 and 2013 and (iv) lower 2012 year-over-year incentive compensation costs. Solid Waste — The comparability of our income from operations for the periods presented is driven by $279 million of net charges primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013. The most significant impairment charges were in our Eastern Canada Area, which is included in Tier 3, and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. Other significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2014 are summarized below: • Our base business benefited from (i) internal revenue growth, principally in our collection and disposal business; (ii) increased fuel cost recovery and (iii) decreased fuel costs. These favorable variances were offset, in part, by net cost increases driven by higher operating expenses in 2013; • Results from our recycling business contributed favorably in 2014 when compared to the prior period principally due to (i) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers; (ii) better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts and (iii) ongoing business improvement efforts around inbound quality control. These favorable variances more than offset lower market prices for recyclable commodities and lower volumes. Results from our recycling business contributed unfavorably in 2013 when compared to the prior period primarily due to (i) lower prices for commodities; (ii) higher processing costs driven in part by increased outbound quality control in 2013 and (iii) operating losses related to the operations of Greenstar acquired in 2013. In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2014 to 2013 within specific segments: • The loss on the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in 2014, which were included in Tier 3 and Tier 1, respectively; • Adverse weather in the first quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected income from operations primarily in Tier 2; • The gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014, which were included in Tier 3; • The accretive benefits of the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which are included in Tier 3; 54 Table of Contents • The gain on the sale of a vacant facility in 2014, which was included in Tier 3; and • A reversal of a reserve in 2014 due to a favorable litigation resolution, which was included in Tier 1. In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2013 to 2012 within specific segments: • A decrease in bad debt expense during 2013 due primarily to the collection of receivables previously reserved during 2012, principally in Puerto Rico, which was included in Tier 3; • The accretive benefits of the RCI operations acquired, as discussed above; • A charge for the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan in New England in 2012, which is included in Tier 2; and • Incremental operating expenses due to a labor union dispute in the Pacific Northwest Area in 2012, which is included in Tier 3. Wheelabrator — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Wheelabrator business in 2014 and 2013 were (i) a $519 million gain on sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and (ii) $627 million of pre-tax charges to impair goodwill and certain waste-to-energy facilities in 2013 as discussed above in Goodwill Impairments and (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. Other items contributing to the variability included (i) higher year-over-year electricity prices at our merchant waste-to-energy facilities and (ii) impairment charges at a waste-to-energy facility as a result of projected operating losses in 2013. Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Energy and Environmental Services and Renewable Energy organizations, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and (iii) the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste. Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: • Net charges of $339 million and $59 million primarily related to impairments recognized in 2014 and 2013, respectively; • Improved results in our Strategic Business Solutions as a result of our system and process enhancements; • Favorable adjustments in 2014 and 2013 to contingent consideration associated with the Greenstar acquisition, offset by higher administrative and restructuring costs associated with the acquired operations in 2013; and • Improved results in our organics and medical waste services in 2013. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: • Restructuring charges recognized in 2014 and subsequent benefits realized as a result of the restructuring; • Charges for the settlement of a legal dispute and related fees in 2014; • Increased health and welfare costs in 2014; 55 Table of Contents • Unfavorable adjustments in both 2014 and 2012 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets; • Our professional fees continued to decline during 2014 as a result of our concerted effort to reduce consulting fees. Our 2013 consulting fees were lower as we incurred significant fees during 2012 resulting from company-wide initiatives; and • Favorable risk management allocation in 2014 and higher year-over-year risk management expense in 2013 primarily due to increased overall costs associated with auto and general liability insurance. Interest Expense, net Our interest expense, net was $466 million in 2014, $477 million in 2013 and $484 million in 2012. During 2014, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to (i) the impacts that lower market interest rates have had on certain of our tax-exempt debt; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and (iii) reduced costs associated with our letter of credit facilities due to improvements in the Company’s overall credit rating. These decreases were partially offset by increases in expense associated with our terminated interest rate swaps due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes. In December 2014, the Company decided to redeem $947 million of senior notes due in 2015, 2017 and 2019 with a weighted average coupon rate of 7.0%. The Company incurred a make-whole premium of $130 million to repay these notes with available cash in January 2015. We anticipate that a near-term refinancing of these debt balances will reduce interest expense in future years. During 2013, our debt balances increased by approximately $300 million, which can generally be attributed to the debt financing of our acquisition of RCI offset by debt repayments. In spite of this increase in debt, we reduced our interest costs by (i) reducing the interest rate periods of some of our tax-exempt bonds, allowing us to benefit from lower rates available for shorter-term remarketings; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and (iii) reducing the cost of our revolving credit facility by amending the credit agreement to provide for lower fees and rates. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of $53 million, $34 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility, as well as (i) noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. The expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was impacted by charges of $11 million in 2014 primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value. The expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was impacted by a charge of $10 million in 2012 related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an equity method investment in an unconsolidated entity that went into liquidation. Other, net We recognized other, net expense of $29 million, $74 million and $18 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were impacted by impairment charges of $22 million, $71 million and $16 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies which were accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated 56 Table of Contents future cash flow projections and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities. Partially offsetting the 2013 charges was a $4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment. The remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $413 million in 2014, $364 million in 2013 and $443 million in 2012. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 23.6%, 73.8% and 34.0% for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) the tax implications of divestitures; (iii) federal tax credits; (iv) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes; (v) tax audit settlements; (vi) the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards and (vii) the tax implications of impairments. The impacts of these items are summarized below: • Tax Implications of Divestitures — During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to divestitures. • Investment in Refined Coal Facility — Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $21 million, $20 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal facility investment. • Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties — Our low-income housing properties investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $37 million, $38 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our low-income housing properties investment. • Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes — Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state law resulted in a reduction of $24 million and increases of $4 million and $7 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. • Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions to our provision for income taxes of $12 million, $11 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. • State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards — During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $16 million, $16 million and $5 million, respectively. • Federal Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards — During 2012, we recognized additional federal net operating loss carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $8 million. • Tax Implications of Impairments — A portion of the impairment charges recognized are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have been reduced by $8 million, $235 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively. See Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to asset impairments and unusual items. We expect our 2015 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 36.0% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items. 57 Table of Contents The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2015 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our future cash taxes by approximately $60 million. Taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014, $32 million in 2013 and $43 million in 2012. These amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from the third parties in anticipation of our sale of the Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities, respectively. The decrease in 2013 is primarily due to the net loss of $10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the $20 million impairment charge related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2014 and 262 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Remaining cubic yards 4,708 275 4,983 4,839 279 5,118 Remaining tonnage 4,660 275 4,935 4,769 282 5,051 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2014 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 23 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 58 Table of Contents The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2014, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 11 12 27 63 89 202 Operated through lease(a) 5 3 1 2 6 17 Operating contracts(b) 9 7 3 6 8 33 Total landfills 25 22 31 71 103 252 (a) Landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance, beginning of year 4,769 282 5,051 4,558 612 5,170 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures (90 ) (5 ) (95 ) 22 — 22 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 90 90 — 33 33 Expansion permits granted(b) 94 (94 ) — 364 (364 ) — Airspace consumed (96 ) — (96 ) (93 ) — (93 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) (17 ) 2 (15 ) (82 ) 1 (81 ) Balance, end of year 4,660 275 4,935 4,769 282 5,051 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at eight of our landfills during 2014 and 12 of our landfills during 2013, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. 59 Table of Contents The tons received at our landfills in 2014 and 2013 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2014 2013 # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay Solid waste landfills 247 (a) 92,847 341 262 93,804 345 Hazardous waste landfills. 5 505 2 5 568 2 252 93,352 343 267 94,372 347 Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 15 3,768 5 390 97,120 (b) 94,762 (b) (a) In 2014, we divested 11 landfills, our contract expired at three landfills and we closed one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.2 million tons at December 31, 2014 and 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2013, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2014, our closed sites management group managed 210 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 (in millions): Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2013 $ 13,416 $ (7,518 ) $ 5,898 Capital additions 407 — 407 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 54 — 54 Amortization of landfill airspace — (380 ) (380 ) Foreign currency translation (106 ) 34 (72 ) Asset retirements and other adjustments (308 ) 174 (134 ) December 31, 2014 $ 13,463 $ (7,690 ) $ 5,773 As of December 31, 2014, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2015, and approximately $800 million in 2016 and 2017 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. 60 Table of Contents Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2013 $ 1,421 $ 227 Obligations incurred and capitalized 54 — Obligations settled (69 ) (21 ) Interest accretion 88 5 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (9 ) 25 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (42 ) (1 ) December 31, 2014 $ 1,443 $ 235 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 88 $ 87 $ 84 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 14 (10 ) 6 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 84 77 67 Landfill remediation costs 9 10 — Other landfill site costs 71 68 67 Total landfill operating costs $ 266 $ 232 $ 224 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and 61 Table of Contents • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 380 $ 400 $ 395 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 96 93 92 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 3.96 $ 4.29 $ 4.30 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 252 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments, and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases. 62 Table of Contents Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,307 $ 58 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 129 $ 125 Tax-exempt bond funds 1 27 Other 41 15 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 171 $ 167 Debt: Current portion $ 1,090 $ 726 Long-term portion 8,345 9,500 Total debt $ 9,435 $ 10,226 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 45 $ 59 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. The increase at December 31, 2014 is primarily related to the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. These balances are primarily included within “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The “Other” balance at December 31, 2014 includes the $29.2 million funding of a legal settlement pending final court approval for disbursement. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2014 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013 were primarily attributable to (i) the use of cash proceeds from the sale of our Wheelabrator business to temporarily repay outstanding borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility; (ii) the use of cash generated from our Canadian operations to reduce the balance of our Canadian term loan and (iii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, interest accretion and capital leases and other debt obligations. Our current debt balances as of December 31, 2014, are primarily related to $947 million of senior notes that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturity, including $350 million of 6.375% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2015, $147 million of 7.125% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in December 2017 and $450 million of 7.375% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2019. We repaid these notes and the related make-whole premium and accrued interest with available cash in January 2015. We anticipate that a near-term refinancing of these debt balances will reduce interest expense in future years. 63 Table of Contents We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2014 2013 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 785 $ 872 Letter of credit facilities(b) 400 400 Other(c) 278 267 $ 1,463 $ 1,539 (a) In July 2013, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, increasing our total credit capacity to $2.25 billion and extending the term through July 2018. At December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings and $785 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,465 million. (b) As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $400 million under letter of credit facilities with terms extending through December 2018. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of December 31, 2014. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,331 $ 2,455 $ 2,295 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 995 $ (1,900 ) $ (1,830 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,072 ) $ (687 ) $ (530 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparisons of our operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 are summarized below: • Increase in earnings – Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $1.2 billion, on a year-over-year basis. Certain of the more significant drivers of our earnings improvement include: • Lower non-cash impairment charges of $652 million in 2014 as compared to 2013; and • The net gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business of $519 million in 2014. After considering these items, and certain other non-cash items included in our comparative results, our earnings drove an improvement in our cash flows from operating activities of approximately $100 million. • Increase in tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes was approximately $247 million higher on a year-over-year basis due to (i) higher pre-tax earnings; (ii) approximately $210 million anticipated overpayment during 2014, when comparing our year-end tax provisions to payments made throughout the year; and (iii) taxes associated with the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. • Forward starting swaps — During the first quarter of 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured, and we paid cash of $36 million to settle the liabilities related to the swaps. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 64 Table of Contents • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2013 as compared with 2012 are summarized below: • Earnings change — Our 2013 earnings drove our improved net cash provided by operating activities in spite of a year-over-year decrease in income from operations, of $772 million. Our income from operations decline resulted from higher non-cash charges during 2013 of $945 million, associated principally with higher impairment charges. Absent these non-cash charges, we experienced higher earnings, which resulted in cash flow expansion. • Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $144 million higher on a year-over-year basis. Note that, while pre-tax income on a year-over-year basis has declined $809 million, a significant portion of the 2013 impairments discussed above do not qualify for a tax benefit. See Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items below for additional information. • Forward starting swaps — During the third quarter of 2012, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances were terminated contemporaneously with the actual issuance of senior notes requiring a cash payment of $59 million. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Other liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Termination of interest rate swaps — In April 2012, we elected to terminate our $1 billion interest rate swap portfolio associated with senior notes that were scheduled to mature from November 2012 through March 2018. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $72 million in cash for their fair value. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in “Other assets” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted in 2013 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Additionally, accruals for our annual incentive plan favorably affected our working capital comparison, driven by both higher incentive plan expense accruals in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower incentive plan payments in 2013 as compared to 2012. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Capital expenditures — We used $1,151 million during 2014 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,271 million in 2013 and $1,510 million in 2012. The decrease can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management. Capital expenditures in 2012 included increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure, and information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as our taking advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation. • Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures and other assets (net of cash divested) were $2,253 million in 2014, $138 million in 2013 and $44 million in 2012. These divestitures were made as 65 Table of Contents part of our initiative to improve or divest certain non-strategic or underperforming operations. In 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. In 2013, our proceeds from divestitures included approximately $41 million related to oil and gas producing properties and $14 million related to certain of our medical waste service operations and a transfer station in our Greater Mid-Atlantic Area. The remaining amount reported for 2013, as well as the proceeds in 2012 generally relate to the sale of fixed assets. • Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $35 million in 2014 compared with $724 million in 2013 and $250 million in 2012. All of our 2014 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. In 2013, our acquisitions consisted primarily of the recycling operations of Greenstar, for which we paid $170 million, and substantially all of the assets of RCI, for which we paid $481 million. The remainder of our 2013 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business and energy services operations. In 2012, our acquisitions consisted primarily of interests in oil and gas producing properties acquired through two transactions, for which we paid $94 million. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. • Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $33 million, $33 million and $77 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014 and 2013, our investments primarily related to additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility and waste diversion technology companies. In 2012, our investments primarily related to furthering our goal of expanding our service offerings and developing waste diversion technologies. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $19 million to our investing activities in 2014 compared with $71 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012. The significant increase in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2013 was due to an increase in tax-exempt borrowings. • Other — Net cash used by our other investing activities of $58 million, $81 million and $51 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in the U.K., prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the ASR repurchase periods, we delivered the $600 million in cash and received 9.6 million shares, which represented 70% of the shares expected to be repurchased based on then-current market prices. These agreements were completed in February 2015 and we received approximately 2.8 million additional shares. The final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed ASR agreements was $48.58. We paid $239 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares of our common stock in 2013. We did not repurchase any shares during 2012. We announced in February 2015 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases; this authorization is the only currently outstanding authorization for share 66 Table of Contents repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. • Dividend payments — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared and approved by our Board of Directors and paid in accordance with our financial plans. We paid an aggregate of $693 million in cash dividends during 2014, compared with $683 million in 2013, and $658 million in 2012. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.355 in 2012, to $0.365 in 2013, and to $0.375 in 2014 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2013 and 2014 as a result of our share repurchase programs. In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.375 to $0.385 per share for dividends declared in 2015. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. • Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $93 million of financing cash inflows during 2014 compared with $132 million during 2013 and $43 million during 2012. The increase in exercised stock options during 2013 and, to a lesser extent, during 2014 is primarily due to the increase in the Company’s stock price combined with exercises in advance of stock option expiration dates. • Debt borrowings (repayments) — Net debt repayments were $751 million in 2014 compared to net debt borrowings of $155 million and $122 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following summarizes our cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Borrowings: U.S. revolving credit facility $ 2,225 $ 1,140 $ 650 Canadian credit facility 88 1,007 379 Senior notes 347 — 495 Capital leases and other debt 157 85 96 $ 2,817 $ 2,232 $ 1,620 Repayments: U.S. revolving credit facility $ (2,645 ) $ (1,120 ) $ (400 ) Canadian credit facility (243 ) (666 ) (447 ) Senior notes (350 ) — (400 ) Tax-exempt bonds (123 ) (162 ) (129 ) Capital leases and other debt (207 ) (129 ) (122 ) $ (3,568 ) $ (2,077 ) $ (1,498 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ (751 ) $ 155 $ 122 During 2014 and 2012, we did not have any significant non-cash investing and financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2013, non-cash investing and financing activities included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds, of $99 million. • Acquisitions of and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests — The purchases of and distributions paid to our noncontrolling interests were $125 million, $59 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase during 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs related to our waste-to-energy facilities in December 2014 67 Table of Contents for $91 million, in anticipation of our sale of our Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our Wheelabrator business. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these LLCs. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities:(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 104 $ 120 $ 128 $ 115 $ 116 $ 2,112 $ 2,695 Environmental remediation 43 26 26 24 12 98 229 147 146 154 139 128 2,210 2,924 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 1,075 717 402 801 132 6,349 9,476 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 103 83 70 57 47 308 668 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 189 172 156 116 91 430 1,154 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2014 $ 1,514 $ 1,118 $ 782 $ 1,113 $ 398 $ 9,297 $ 14,222 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2014 include $638 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 68 Table of Contents Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items Bonus Depreciation — The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2015 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately $60 million. Taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Overall, the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs resulted in increased cash taxes of $30 million in 2014. Separately, our tax payments in 2014 were $247 million higher than the tax payments made in 2013 primarily due to (i) higher pre-tax earnings, (ii) an anticipated overpayment of taxes, and (iii) divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. Uncertain Tax Positions — We have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We anticipate that approximately $12 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and $3 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals primarily relate to state tax items, none of which are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2014, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standard Pending Adoption In May 2014, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our income from operations margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not 69 Table of Contents expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2014, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2014, we had $9.4 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $1.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2015. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $501 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $638 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months and (iii) $232 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian credit facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2015 interest expense by approximately $11.2 million. As of December 31, 2013, the effective interest rates of approximately $2.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments, if any, can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $650 million at December 31, 2014. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally 70 Table of Contents correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. During the three years ended December 31, 2014, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities, with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives divested in conjunction with the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as a cost center in India and investments in Hong Kong. From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. The foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives. 71 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:44.795112
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2003. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1 of this report, under the section “Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements.” The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We are in an industry that provides an essential service needed by nearly every business and person. Our success depends on our ability to focus on our core business, operational excellence and financial strength and flexibility. In 2003, we continued to build financial strength by meeting our goal of producing adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. Free cash flow is not a financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, we include it in our communications to stockholders because we believe that the amount of cash we produce from our non-financing activities that is available to us for such things as acquisitions, share repurchases, debt reductions and dividends is important in evaluating our performance, including meeting our goal of providing value to our stockholders. We compute free cash flow by taking the net cash that was provided by our operating activities, subtracting capital expenditures and adding proceeds from our divestitures and other sales of assets. Free cash flow is then adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider unusual for the year. In 2003, the net cash provided by our operating activities was approximately $1.9 billion. We spent approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures. After adding back the proceeds we received of approximately $74 million from divestitures of businesses and other asset sales, our free cash flow was approximately $800 million. We adjusted this amount to take into consideration the approximately $223 million net cash impact for the settlement of our stockholder class action settlement, giving us approximately $1.02 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2003. To help us improve our business and operations, we have developed branded initiatives like WasteRoute and Service Machine, as well as other initiatives to improve safety, procurement, operations, cost control and sales. Although we made significant progress in 2003, we have much more to do in 2004 and beyond and our Company is now better positioned to reap the benefits of the programs we have put in place. An integral part of our focus has been on internal, or organic, growth. In 2003, internal revenue growth was 0.9%, or $103 million, as compared to 2002. The biggest driver in this increase was price, and we continue to work on our pricing program. However, volumes declined as compared to the prior year, due mostly to the loss of a large contract with the City of Chicago early in the year, offsetting some of our pricing achievement. We believe some of our performance in 2003 was due to general economic factors, although increased competition also played a part. We cannot control the economy, but we can compete, and therefore we focused on customer churn rates and sales force effectiveness. In 2003, we continued to hold our customer churn rate below 10%, which we see as a benchmark for success, and we maintained the same amount of new sales dollars in 2003 as compared to the prior year, even with a smaller sales force. Moreover, it is generally believed that the waste industry lags the economy by six to nine months. Consequently, our sales force effectiveness program, including our pricing strategy, should result in greater internal revenue growth if the recent economic recovery continues in 2004 and beyond. Finally, we also actively pursue strategic acquisitions in our NASW operations. Through acquisitions, we increased our 2003 revenue by $334 million. To achieve our goal of operational excellence, we have been working hard to seek operational and cost efficiencies. In 2003, we further streamlined our operating infrastructure, which resulted in the elimination of about 1,300 employee positions and 470 contract workers. For 2003, we saw cost savings from the reorganization in our selling, general and administrative costs, while at the same time growing our total revenues by 4%. The reorganization changed the roles of our people in the field so that our operating sites are responsible for delivering service and operational excellence and the market areas are responsible for implementing strategy, improving performance and ensuring profitability in their markets. 20 When measured on an initiative-by-initiative basis, which is the way we measure our goals internally, we believe that our efforts on cost reductions and efficiency programs are paying off. We have continued to decrease the maintenance cost per driver hour, which is the primary performance metric for fleet maintenance. We also are focusing on container maintenance, and have created improvement plans and conducted test pilots to see where we can reduce costs. Additionally, our focus on our safety program resulted in another year-over-year decrease in recordable injuries and vehicle accidents, although our per claim costs continued to rise, offsetting the financial benefit of the reduced number of claims. Finally, our WasteRoute initiative reduced the number of routes we have, and now we are looking for opportunities to further save on route-related costs. Our operating costs and expenses for 2003 do not show the level of improvement we believe we have made in our initiatives to cut overall costs. This is due to an increase in those costs as a result of a recharacterization of expenses that had previously been classified as selling, general and administrative costs, increased costs of goods sold due to acquisitions of recycling businesses, the implementation of SFAS No. 143, increased disposal costs at third party facilities and increased labor rates. However, we believe that we have the momentum necessary to continue all of our efforts and make progress in 2004. We also believe that we have our organizational structure and field based management at the appropriate size for the current economy as well as for business opportunities from an expanding economy. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments, as described below. Landfills — Effective January 1, 2003, our method of accounting for landfill closure and post-closure, as well as landfill final capping, changed as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Through December 31, 2002, the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with (i) amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and (ii) future closure and post-closure obligations on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice, referred to as life-cycle accounting within the waste industry, continues to be followed, with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill, as was the practice prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity. This includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events. The total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs, landfill liner construction costs, operating construction costs, and capitalized interest costs. 21 Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. They then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain. Available Airspace — Our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills. This is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate, based on height restrictions and other factors, how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable, using the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 84 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2003, 25 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Approximately two-thirds of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because legal, community, or other issues could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements, which in many cases were due to state-specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs at our landfills, including final capping costs and closure and post-closure costs, and the available and probable expansion airspace relating to such costs, we then determine the per ton 22 rates that will be expensed. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. It is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, the costs of the landfill, including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing, as described below. Lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher closure and post-closure rates, and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. Additionally, if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an actual third-party evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. 23 Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: • A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; • A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; • A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; • An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; • Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or • A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — We assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. 24 Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period-to-period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the various statement of operations line items.

As shown below, North American Solid Waste, or NASW, is our principal operation, and is comprised of seven operating Groups within North America, along with our Other NASW services. The operations shown as “Other” in the table below consisted of international waste management services and non-solid waste services, all of which were divested as of March 31, 2002.

Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our five geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of NASW operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions).

Certain of these price increases relate to additional costs and taxes that have been charged to our customers. However, the increase was partially offset by our landfill business, where we experienced decreases in price-related revenue principally 27 due to our special waste landfill operations, mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the United States. 2002 versus 2001 The revenue increase due to price in our base business was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations. However, these increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations. Price — Commodity 2003 versus 2002 The commodity price increases in 2003 were driven by the prices of ONP and plastic commodities. ONP prices increased to an average of $69 per ton for 2003 as compared to an average of $67 per ton for 2002. Plastic commodity prices have increased an average of 50%. Partially offsetting these increases is a decline in the price of OCC, which has declined to an average of $64 per ton in 2003 as compared to an average of $71 per ton in 2002. 2002 versus 2001 There were significant increases in commodity prices in 2002 as compared to 2001, most notably an increase in OCC prices, which increased to an average price of $71 per ton for 2002 as compared to an average price of $45 per ton for 2001. Price — Electricity and Fuel 2003 versus 2002 Electricity rates remained relatively flat in 2003 as compared to 2002. However, we experienced positive price increases due to increased fuel surcharges billed to customers as a result of higher fuel costs. 2002 versus 2001 Reduced electricity rates and fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change in 2002 as compared to the prior year. Volume 2003 versus 2002 The decrease in revenue due to volumes was primarily in our collection and recycling businesses. We believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition, particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the United States. Our loss of a contract with the City of Chicago during February 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling, accounting for lost revenues of approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills, primarily in the southern and western portions of the United States. 2002 versus 2001 The volume decline in 2002 as compared to 2001 largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations, with the exception of the southern portion of the United States, where we realized slight volume increases. We also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the United States. We believe that the overall decreased volumes, particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services, were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition. However, the declines were offset by increased volumes in our recycling operations of $19 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. 28 Acquisitions and Divestitures 2003 versus 2002 In connection with our formation of Recycle America Alliance in January 2003, we acquired the Peltz Group, the largest privately-held recycler in the United States. We also acquired several collection businesses that complemented and enhanced our existing collection network. These increases were partially offset by divestitures of low margin operations. 2002 versus 2001 Revenue in 2002 increased due to a number of individually small acquisitions consummated during 2002 and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in 2001. The increases due to acquisitions were partially offset by 2002 divestitures. Foreign Currency Translation 2003 versus 2002 Fluctuations in the relative value of the Canadian dollar favorably affected revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2002 versus 2001 Fluctuations in the relative value of the Canadian dollar negatively affected revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating Costs and Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Shown Below) Our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits, risks management costs, fuel, facility operating costs, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations, and accretion of and expense revisions relating to future landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs and environmental remediation. Certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed, and include acquisition, engineering, upgrading, construction, capitalized interest, and permitting costs. Additionally, we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial, defense and tort claim costs. Such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating costs and expenses were $637 million higher than the prior year period, representing an increase of 9.3%. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating costs and expenses were 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003, which is a 3.2 percentage point increase from the prior year period. The increase was generally due to: • Increased cost of goods sold of approximately $205 million, largely related to higher commodity sales through our acquisition of the Peltz Group in January 2003; • Increased disposal costs of approximately $104 million, attributable to related volume increases, disposal cost increases at third party facilities and increased taxes of approximately $18 million on disposal of waste in Pennsylvania, although the majority of the tax increases have been passed on to our customers as price increases; • Salary and wage increases of approximately $59 million representing annual merit raises and increased overtime expenses, partially offset by headcount reductions; • The reorganization of our operations in March 2002 and the determination that certain employee costs and facility-related expenses were more appropriately classified as operating expenses after the adoption of the new organizational structure and the reclassification of these costs beginning in the second quarter of 2002, the first full accounting period that these organizational changes were effective. 29 During the first quarter of 2003, approximately $50 million of such costs have been classified as operating expenses that would have been reported as selling, general and administrative costs before the reorganization; • The effect of strengthening of the Canadian dollar on foreign currency translation, which resulted in a $47 million increase in operating expenses related to our Canadian operations; • An increase in fuel costs of approximately $45 million, an average increase of $0.19 per gallon; • Increases in subcontractor costs of approximately $40 million due to (i) the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints primarily in the eastern portion of the United States, (ii) increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business, (iii) general volume increases and (iv) increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services; • Increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately $24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003; • Increased risk management expenses of approximately $20 million as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs; and • Increased repair and maintenance costs of approximately $8 million, which is mostly from changes in the timing and scope of certain maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities. Business acquisitions accounted for approximately $286 million of the increases discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating costs and expenses were $214 million higher than the prior year period, representing an increase of 3.2%. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating costs and expenses were 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002, which is a 2.8 percentage point increase from the prior year period. The increase was generally due to: • A re-characterization of certain costs that were reported as selling, general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in certain roles and responsibilities as a result of our March 2002 reorganization; • Increases in disposal and subcontractor costs. Disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the disposal of waste in Pennsylvania, which were partially offset by decreases in disposal costs due to declines in volumes in 2002. Subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors for certain of our national account customers in areas where we do not provide services and increased use of third party transportation of waste to disposal facilities; • Annual merit increases and other employee benefit cost increases; • Higher costs associated with recycling commodities due primarily to an increase in market prices for OCC and ONP, which resulted in increased rebates paid to customers; and • The recovery of claims against insurers for the reimbursement of environmental expenses recorded in 2001 as an offset to operating costs and expenses. These increases in operating costs and expenses were offset by headcount reductions as a result of the March 2002 reorganization and divestitures of our international operations in 2001 and the non-solid waste operations in the first quarter of 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses include management salaries, clerical and administrative costs, marketing costs, professional services, facility rentals, provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs, as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service. 30 For the year ended December 31, 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $176 million, or 12.6%, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease was 2.0 percentage points from 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was generally due to: • The re-characterization of costs related principally to employee costs and facility-related expenses, including property taxes, utilities, and risk management expenses, that have been reflected as operating costs since April 1, 2002, as discussed above in Operating Costs and Expenses; • Cost savings of approximately $41 million through reductions in salary and other labor-related costs as a result of our March 2002 reorganization and February and June 2003 restructurings; • A reduction of over $20 million in costs due to management’s focus on reducing spending related to professional fees, supplies, travel and entertainment and other administrative costs; and • Favorable settlements of legal disputes in 2003 in addition to the unfavorable impact of increases in legal reserves in 2002. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to: • Management’s focus on reducing spending related to professional fees, travel and entertainment, and other administrative costs; • Headcount reductions and the re-characterization of certain expenses as costs of operations as a result of the March 2002 restructuring; and • Divestitures of international and non-solid waste operations in 2001 and in early 2002. These reductions were offset partially by increased costs associated with litigation settlements, higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy, workers compensation costs, and property-related costs such as property taxes, maintenance and security. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life primarily on a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements (generally from 3 to 7 years); (ii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight-line basis from 3 to 50 years; (iii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site; and (iv) as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event. As a percentage of operating revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 10.9% in 2003, 11.0% in 2002 and 12.1% in 2001. Depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 even after considering the effect of the accounting changes that resulted from our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 is primarily attributable to our adoption of SFAS No. 142, which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on January 1, 2002. Goodwill amortization for 2001 was $156 million, or 1.4% of operating revenues. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in 2001, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 0.3% from 2001 to 2002. The following schedule reflects the 2001 adjusted net income (excluding goodwill 31 and negative goodwill amortization) as compared to the results of operations for December 31, 2002 and 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Reported net income $ 630 $ 822 $ 503 Add back: goodwill amortization, net of taxes — — 124 Adjusted net income $ 630 $ 822 $ 627 Basic earnings per common share: Reported net income $ 1.07 $ 1.34 $ 0.80 Goodwill amortization, net of taxes — — 0.20 Adjusted net income $ 1.07 $ 1.34 $ 1.00 Diluted earnings per common share: Reported net income $ 1.06 $ 1.33 $ 0.80 Goodwill amortization, net of taxes — — 0.20 Adjusted net income $ 1.06 $ 1.33 $ 1.00 Restructuring In 2002, we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic Groups to better align collection, transport, recycling and disposal resources. As part of the restructuring, we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1,900 field-level administrative and operational positions. In 2002, we recorded $38 million in pre-tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure. These charges included $36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and $2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements. In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating Groups to 66 from 91 at December 31, 2002, and reduced certain overhead positions to further streamline our organization. Management believes that this structure results in a more effective utilization of resources and enables us to serve our customers more efficiently. In connection with these restructuring efforts, we reduced our workforce by about 700 employees and 270 contract workers. We recorded $20 million of pre-tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure, all of which was associated with employee severance and benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by these organizational changes and a focus on fully utilizing the capabilities of our information technology resources enabled us to further reduce our workforce in June 2003. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of 600 employee positions and 200 contract worker positions. We recorded $24 million of pre-tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $11 million remains accrued for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of these workforce reductions. Our obligations for the accrued severance payments continue through the third quarter of 2005. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of $13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset, in part, by $5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges. In 2002, the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to (i) our receipt of approximately $11 million related to a previously impaired, non-revenue producing asset, (ii) net gains of 32 approximately $8 million on divestitures during the year and (iii) reductions to legal reserves of approximately $8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately $7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items. In 2001, the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of $374 million, which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in July 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The final net cash settlement payment of $377 million, which is the amount provided by the settlement agreement plus accrued interest less our recoveries, was made in the third quarter of 2003. Additionally in 2001, we recorded a held-for-sale adjustment of approximately $15 million related to our international operations along with a held-for-sale adjustment for an investment in Mexican solid waste operations of approximately $28 million. Offsetting these expenses was a net gain of $24 million (comprised of the reversal of the held-for-sale impairment of $109 million and a held-for-use impairment of $85 million) from our decision during the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our independent power production plants, and the reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of those plants from held-for-sale to held-for-use. Also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 were reversals of certain loss contract reserves of $13 million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased consistently each year from 2001 to 2003. The decrease in interest expense is partially attributable to our increased utilization of tax-exempt financing, which has resulted in a decline in our weighted average interest rate. The remaining decrease in interest expense from 2001 to 2003 is attributable to the overall positive impact of our interest rate derivative contracts, which are used to manage our interest rate exposure, and the general decline in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by $90 million in 2003, $86 million in 2002 and $39 million in 2001. Other Income We experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 as compared to other years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment. In 2002, a company in which we held an approximately 17% interest was acquired by another entity. We also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition. The proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $404 million for 2003, $422 million for 2002 and $283 million for 2001 resulting in an effective income tax rate of 36.0%, 34.0%, and 36.1% for each of the three years, respectively. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset in part by non-conventional fuel tax credits. Additionally, in 2003 we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits. In 2002 we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture. A tax benefit of approximately $31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carry-back of losses by our Dutch subsidiary. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2001 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses, the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested, offset in part by non-conventional fuel tax credits. Additionally, in 2001 scheduled Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of $42 million, which was 33 offset in part by a tax expense of $24 million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in Canada. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principle In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively, to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below. • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded approximately $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we recorded approximately $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. • In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded approximately $101 million, including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs. • In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded approximately $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. For a discussion of these variable interest entities see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a credit of $2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write-off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. In the first quarter of 2001, adoption of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, resulted in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $2 million. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Canadian, Wheelabrator and Recycling Groups. These Groups, when combined with certain other operations, comprise our North American Solid Waste, or NASW, operations. The operations not managed through our seven operating Groups are presented herein as “Other NASW.” 34 As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, our restructuring and workforce reductions have impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002. The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Canadian $ 76 (a) $ 37 (a) $ 73 Eastern 360 (b) 510 529 Midwest 323 345 356 Southern 589 571 584 Western 368 375 (c) 428 Wheelabrator 229 209 229 Recycling (7 ) 2 (23 ) Other NASW (26 ) (38 )(d) — Total NASW $ 1,912 $ 2,011 $ 2,176 (a) A favorable legal settlement of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of $26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of the increase in 2003 income from operations as compared with 2002. The unfavorable 2002 legal settlement also had a significant effect on the comparability of 2002 and 2001 income from operations for our Canadian Group. (b) The most significant factors that affected the Eastern Group’s 2003 operating income were (i) lower collection and landfill volumes, (ii) increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the United States, (iii) general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs and (iv) harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003. (c) The landfill line of business was the primary driver of the decline in 2002 income from operations as compared with 2001. Specifically, the Western Group’s landfill volumes were significantly affected by (i) volume constraints in the Los Angeles market and (ii) volume declines at industrial landfills associated with the economic downturn in the western region of the United States that began in the second half of 2001 and continued throughout 2002 and into 2003. (d) Other NASW includes operations provided throughout our operating Groups for methane gas recovery and certain third party sub-contract and administrative revenues managed by our national accounts function. Also included are certain year-end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their individual Group performance for the periods disclosed. The decline in income from operations was driven in part by increased costs associated with our national accounts function, primarily due to 2001 credit adjustments for bad debt and loss contract reserves, and in part by the effect of unfavorable 2002 year-end adjustments and favorable 2001 year-end adjustments related to the reportable segments. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year $ 135 $ 264 $ 730 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,926 $ 2,153 $ 2,355 Cash used in investing activities $ (1,084 ) $ (962 ) $ (1,232 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (973 ) $ (1,658 ) $ (485 ) Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. We generated cash flows from operations of approximately $1.9 billion in 2003, which included approximately $109 million received for the fair value of interest rate swap agreements terminated prior to their scheduled maturities. Also included as a component of 2003 cash flows from operations is a net cash 35 outflow of approximately $223 million associated with the final settlement of our securities class action lawsuit, which occurred during the third quarter. Settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during the year includes: (i) a final net cash settlement payment of approximately $377 million associated with the settlement agreement of a shareholder class action suit plus accrued interest; (ii) utilization of insurance proceeds of approximately $87 million to settle the remaining portion of the settlement; (iii) a total tax benefit of approximately $138 million, of which we realized $66 million in the second quarter and $36 million in each of the third and fourth quarters and (iv) related net settlement recoveries of approximately $16 million. During 2003 we used $1.1 billion for investing activities, consisting of $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and $337 million for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, which were offset by net receipts of $371 million from restricted funds and proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other asset sales and other items of $82 million. Additionally, we used $1.0 billion for financing activities, which consisted primarily of the repurchase of shares of our common stock for $550 million and net debt reductions of $456 million. Our cash balances decreased by $466 million from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures, our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates. In 2002, cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by $166 million for cash received from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities, offset by cash paid of $66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances. Included in our investing activities was cash paid of $1.3 billion for capital expenditures and $162 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds of $487 million from other investing activities, primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds. Included in our financing activities was cash paid of $982 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, we paid $697 million for net debt reductions and received $27 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants. In 2001, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $2.4 billion. Favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of $59 million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and $64 million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities. Included in our investing activities was $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of $212 million. In addition, we used $485 million for financing activities, which is comprised of $510 million of net debt reductions and $25 million of other financing activities, offset by proceeds of $50 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants. We operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: • the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; • our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; • our liquidity profile; • our asset base; and • our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. In addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations, we have capital requirements for (i) capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites, as well as new trucks and equipment 36 for collection and other operations, (ii) refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy facilities and (iii) business acquisitions. For 2004, we currently expect to spend approximately $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion for capital expenditures and approximately $250 million for acquisitions. In February 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion in annual repurchases for each year through 2004, to be implemented at management’s discretion. Share repurchases in 2003 were less than the $1 billion allowed because we used funds that would have otherwise been available for this program to settle our securities class action lawsuit and for our acquisition program. We expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions. The following is a summary of activity to date for our stock repurchase program (in millions, except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars). Agreement Common Stock Total Net Common Purchase Settlement Stock Transaction Type Initiating Date Settlement Date Shares Price Price (Received)/Paid Repurchases Private Accelerated Purchase(a) March 2002 August 2002 10,925 $27.46 $ 300 $ (18 )(b) $ 282 Private Accelerated Purchase(a) December 2002 February 2003 1,731 $24.52 42 (3 )(c) 39 Private Accelerated Purchase(a) March 2003 May 2003 2,400 $20.00 48 3 (d) 51 Open Market Purchases(e) N/A N/A 45,244 $19.70-$29.48 1,184 N/A 1,184 60,300 $ 1,574 $ 1,556 (a) We accounted for the initial payments as a purchase of treasury stock and classified the future settlements with the counterparty as an equity instrument because we had the option under these agreements to settle our obligations, if any, in shares of our common stock. (b) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $18 million less than the approximately $300 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the counterparty paid us this difference of approximately $18 million at the end of the valuation period, which occurred during the third quarter of 2002, to settle the agreement. We accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. (c) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $3 million less than the approximately $42 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the agreement, the counterparty paid us the difference of approximately $3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement. (d) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $3 million more than the approximately $48 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the agreement, we paid the counterparty the difference of approximately $3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement. (e) During 2003 we purchased 19.6 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately $526 million. During 2002 we purchased 25.6 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately $658 million. We engaged in these purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to law and our insider trading policy. In August 2003, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend program beginning in 2004. It is expected that the dividend will be $0.1875 per share per quarter, or $0.75 per share annually. The first quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share will be paid on March 25, 2004 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2004. Our 2004 dividend payments are expected to result in a cash outlay of approximately $430 million. 37 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 109 $ 118 $ 83 $ 71 $ 98 $ 1,165 $ 1,644 Environmental remediation 57 62 29 17 13 198 376 166 180 112 88 111 1,363 2,020 Debt payments(b) 514 (c) 863 433 475 518 5,708 8,511 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations(e) 81 75 69 62 49 230 566 Unconditional purchase obligations(f) 204 102 95 75 73 306 855 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2003 $ 965 $ 1,220 $ 709 $ 700 $ 751 $ 7,607 $ 11,952 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 without the impact of discounting and inflation. The environmental liabilities included in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 are based upon the estimated fair value of the final-capping, closure and post-closure obligations associated with the airspace capacity that has been consumed at our landfills through the end of the reporting period and our estimates of probable environmental remediation obligations. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our 2004 interest payments are expected to be approximately $500 million. Additionally, we use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure associated with the terms of these instruments. (c) We have $819 million of debt obligations with contractual maturities on or before December 31, 2004. This includes $150 million of 8.0% senior notes due April 30, 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes due May 15, 2004 and $294 million of 7% senior notes due October 1, 2004. We have classified $550 million of these debt obligations as long-term at December 31, 2003 because we have the intent and ability to refinance these obligations with long-term debt instruments. Classified as a current obligation at December 31, 2003 is $245 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the reoffering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed offering. (d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (e) Included in our non-cancelable operating lease obligations are minimum rent payments for two of our waste-to-energy facilities that are required under leasing arrangements that we have with unconsolidated variable interest entities. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of these lease agreements. Our commitments under these lease arrangements do not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations. However, we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and, when appropriate, will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had a three-year, $650 million syndicated revolving credit facility and a five-year, $1.75 billion syndicated revolving credit facility. The three-year revolver matures in June 2005 and the five-year revolver matures in June 2006. At December 31, 2003, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately $792 million. As of December 31, 2003, we are required to maintain the following financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities: (i) an interest coverage ratio; (ii) total debt to EBITDA ratio; and (iii) minimum net worth, all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the 38 covenants. The interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (A) our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes (“EBIT”) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to (B) consolidated total interest expense for such period, to be less than 3 to 1. The total debt to EBITDA covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter, we will not permit the ratio of (A) all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to (B) EBIT plus depreciation and amortization expense (“EBITDA”) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed 3.25 to 1. Our minimum net worth covenant restricts us from allowing stockholders’ equity to be less than $3.5 billion plus 75% of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter, beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001. The credit facilities requiring compliance with these financial covenants state that the calculations must be based on generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and applied by us during the latest fiscal year before the date of the facilities, or December 31, 2000 and 2001. Therefore, our adoption or implementation of accounting pronouncements or interpretations effective after those dates does not impact the calculation of the financial covenants defined above. We are in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facilities and all other debt instruments. We have increased our utilization of tax-exempt financing and plan to continue this trend due to the attractive rates offered for these instruments. As such, we continue to assess our financial assurance and letter of credit requirements and expect that we will arrange additional long-term letter of credit and/or surety bond capacity in advance of our business requirements. We have issued tax-exempt bonds primarily for the construction of collection and disposal facilities. Proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities. Accordingly, we report these amounts as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid. At December 31, 2003, approximately $465 million of funds were held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities. These fund balances are included as other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Historically, proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust funds have been invested in cash and cash equivalents. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 we determined that it would be beneficial to invest these funds in longer term, higher yield debt instruments. As of December 31, 2003, $397 million of our trust fund assets funded by tax-exempt bonds and held for future capital expenditures were invested in U.S. government agency debt securities with maturities ranging from less than one year to three years. We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, which was approximately 63% fixed and 37% floating at December 31, 2003. In addition, we use variable rate tax-exempt financings and periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the then-current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to (i) lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, (ii) product and service purchase commitments as discussed in the Other long-term commitments section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and (iii) guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These lease agreements and purchase commitments are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities, products and services at competitive, market-driven prices. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the period ended December 31, 2003 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 39 Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months, primarily due to the lower volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to decrease during the winter months. Our first and fourth quarter results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. We also use the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities, so repair and maintenance expense is generally higher in our first quarter than in other quarters during the year. In addition, particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations. We believe that inflation has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2003, all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions, with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations. An instantaneous, one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at both December 31, 2003 and 2002 by approximately $500 million. This analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. Since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately $752 million of restricted funds held in trust funds and escrow accounts included as a component of other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet. These funds are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short-terms of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. 40 Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreign-currency denominated debt. There would be no material impact if there were an instantaneous 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates at either December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled waste paper products such as ONP and OCC from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under these swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. We record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits. An instantaneous 10% increase in OCC and ONP prices would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately $10 million on both December 31, 2003 and 2002. This analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged. See Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 41",2023-12-30 20:45:10.933536
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2004. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1 of this report, under the section “Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements.” The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We had some positive experiences in 2004, but also some challenges. Volumes were generally strong throughout 2004, providing the most significant volume-related revenue growth we had seen in a few years. While generating revenue growth from pricing remained difficult, we experienced a positive change in yield on base business in 2004. We had reasonable success with price increases to existing customers in our collection line of business in most markets. However, we continue to experience increased pricing competition in our collection operations, characterized by offers from competitors to our customers to provide the same services at much lower prices than we are charging and by lower average rates being offered by the competition on new business bids. This was especially prevalent in the Midwest Group. Additionally, we experienced declines in yield from 2003 to 2004 for our landfill operations, due largely to competitive pricing on special waste, although those declines were partially offset by increased municipal solid waste pricing. Although we saw an economic recovery in 2004 that brought with it increased volumes, we did not experience significantly increased pricing. We previously implemented a pricing model for our collection operations, and recently announced a landfill pricing study. Pursuant to this study, we chose 30 landfills at which we will be increasing pricing on municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste. The objective is to gather and analyze information to help us better understand the reactions to the increases, which will help us to manage our pricing in the future. We also had continued success in implementing our operational excellence initiatives during 2004. In the area of safety, we launched Mission to Zero in late 2000 with the objective of promoting zero tolerance for unsafe actions, conditions and attitudes across the organization. Our goal is to attain world-class safety for the protection of our employees, customers and communities. We continue to see improvements in both our total recordable incident rate and hourly accident recordable rate, which are the metrics we use to measure our success in attaining this goal. We also continued to make progress in 2004 in the area of fleet maintenance and route optimization. The metric we use for our fleet maintenance is maintenance cost per driver hour, which we try to improve through basic planning and scheduling of maintenance work as well as enhanced training. For our route optimization initiative, we use a proprietary software application called WasteRoute, designed to help us organize our routes more efficiently. We believe the optimization initiative has resulted in improved productivity as we continue to reduce the number of routes. Our plans going forward are to institutionalize the best practices we have identified to support our future productivity improvement. In 2004, we experienced increases in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as compared with the prior year. However, these costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat, which we believe demonstrates the effectiveness of our cost reduction programs in these areas. We experienced the increases in operating expenses that are expected as a result of increased revenues. The biggest drivers increasing costs of operations were increased subcontractor costs as a result of higher volumes, some of which came from the hurricane clean up work, higher costs of goods sold, fuel costs and an increase in the cost of steel. Our costs of goods sold include rebates made by the Recycling Group to suppliers, and are based on market prices of recyclable commodities. Fuel costs also increased during the year, although a significant portion of those costs were offset through our fuel surcharges to customers. The increase in dollars spent in 2004 on selling, general and administrative costs related to increased salaries and wages and increased commissions and bonuses, which are a result of the overall improvement in our operating results. Additionally, we experienced increased professional fees as a result of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and increased litigation, defense and indemnification costs related to legal matters. 23 We believe that the production of free cash flow is a very important measure of our liquidity and operating results as it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase stock and execute our acquisition program. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows that was prepared in accordance with GAAP. We generated approximately $1.06 billion in free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2004. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities, and adding to that the proceeds from divestitures, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets, as shown in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,218 Capital expenditures (1,258 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets 96 Free cash flow $ 1,056 We are projecting full-year 2005 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, based on estimated net cash provided by operating activities being in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion, capital expenditures between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, and proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets of $125 million to $150 million. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the following reclassifications have been made in our prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation: • Mandated fees and taxes — We conformed the prior year’s presentation of our revenues and expenses with the current year’s presentation by increasing both our revenue and our operating expenses by approximately $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and by approximately $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. • Cash balances — We increased both our cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable balances at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 by approximately $82 million, $95 million and $25 million, respectively, upon identifying certain cash accounts with negative balances and no legal right of offset. The related changes in our accounts payable balances during each reporting period have been treated as financing activities within the statement of cash flows as a component of cash used in financing activities — other. • Foreign currency translation — We decreased both our accrued liabilities balance and our accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 by approximately $39 million and $2 million, respectively to reflect an adjustment required to fully capture the impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated Canadian operations. • Equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities — Our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated entities has historically been presented as a component of other income in our statements of operations and the related cash flow impact has been reflected as a component of the change in other assets within our statements of cash flows. As a result of investments we made during 2004, this activity has become a more significant component of our net income and operating cash flow activity. Accordingly, we have shown equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities as a separate component within our statement of operations and equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities, net of distributions, as a separate component of cash provided by operating activities. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. • Net deferred tax liability — During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a detailed review of our deferred tax balances and related tax-basis balance sheets. The culmination of this effort was a 24 decrease in our net current deferred tax assets of approximately $310 million, and a decrease in our net long-term deferred tax liabilities of approximately $356 million as of December 31, 2003. The resultant over accrual of our net deferred tax liability of approximately $46 million was recorded as a reduction of goodwill as this adjustment is associated with our previous acquisition activity. Our deferred tax balances and goodwill as of December 31, 2003 have been adjusted to reflect this change. • Segments — Early in the third quarter of 2004, we implemented a market realignment that consisted of moving our Ohio operations to the Midwest Group and our Kentucky operations to the Southern Group, both of which were previously in the Eastern Group. We believe that the realignment will provide benefits to each of the operating groups affected. Specifically, the Ohio Market Area faces many of the same issues as other industrial regions in the Midwest Group and the Kentucky Market Area’s rural characteristics make it similar to other markets in the Southern Group. By balancing the revenues between each of the Groups, we will enable the Eastern Group leadership team to focus on the challenges associated with the Northeast corridor. As a result of the realignment, we have reclassified the operating results of the Ohio and Kentucky Market Areas for all periods presented to provide segment financial information that appropriately reflects our approach to managing operations. Additionally, certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financials statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. The financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments, as described below. Landfills — Effective January 1, 2003, our method of accounting for landfill closure and post-closure, as well as landfill final capping, changed as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Through December 31, 2002, the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with (i) amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and (ii) future closure and post-closure obligations on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice, referred to as life-cycle accounting within the waste industry, continues to be followed, with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill, as was the practice prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and 25 landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs are dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. They then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually or more often, as significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. However, as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Available Airspace — Our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills. This is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate, based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors, how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, using the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of 26 Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 73 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2004, 19 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Approximately three-fourths of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because legal, community or other issues could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements, which in many cases were due to state-specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs at our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, the costs of the landfill, including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing, as described below. Lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher closure and post-closure rates, and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. Additionally, if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a 27 single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an actual third-party valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: • A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; • A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; • A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; • An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; • Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or • A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. 28 Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period-to-period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the respective statement of operations line items: Period-to-Period Change Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Statement of Operations: Operating revenues $ 868 7.5 % $ 437 3.9 % Costs and expenses: Operating (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) 637 8.4 642 9.2 Selling, general and administrative 51 4.2 (176 ) (12.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 71 5.6 43 3.5 Restructuring (45 ) * 6 * Asset impairments and unusual items (5 ) * 26 * 709 7.0 541 5.7 Income from operations 159 10.3 (104 ) (6.3 ) Other income (expense): Interest expense, net 42 9.8 19 4.3 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities (102 ) * (2 ) (33.3 ) Minority interest (30 ) * 1 14.3 Other, net (14 ) * (33 ) * (104 ) (24.9 ) (15 ) (3.7 ) Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 55 4.9 (119 ) (9.6 ) Provision for income taxes (157 ) * (18 ) (4.3 ) Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 212 29.5 % $ (101 ) (12.3 )% * Percentage change is not meaningful.

As shown below, North American Solid Waste, or “NASW,” is our principal operation, and is comprised of seven operating Groups within North America, along with our Other NASW services. The operations shown as “Non-NASW Divested Operations” in the table below consisted of our non-solid waste services, which were divested as of March 31, 2002.

Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties generally based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our five geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of NASW operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Collection $ 8,318 $ 7,782 $ 7,588 Landfill 3,004 2,834 2,811 Transfer 1,680 1,582 1,460 Wheelabrator 835 819 789 Recycling and other 1,083 894 635 Intercompany (2,404 ) (2,263 ) (2,080 ) Total NASW $ 12,516 $ 11,648 $ 11,203 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in NASW revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change for Change for 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Average yield: Base business $ 85 0.7 % $ 70 0.6 % Commodity 143 1.2 13 0.1 Electricity 2 — 4 — Fuel surcharges and fees 53 0.5 37 0.3 Total 283 2.4 124 1.0 Volume 340 3.0 (16 ) (0.1 ) Internal growth 623 5.4 108 0.9 Acquisitions 233 2.0 334 3.0 Divestitures (27 ) (0.2 ) (54 ) (0.4 ) Foreign currency translation 39 0.3 57 0.5 $ 868 7.5 % $ 445 4.0 % Base Business — Base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection, transfer and waste-to-energy operations in 2004 as compared with 2003. In our collection business, the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations, where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements. Although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 has been positive, it was affected by increased price competition, particularly in the Midwest, and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the South. The base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 31 have been almost exclusively attributable to the Eastern portion of the United States. However, increased pricing in our transfer business in the East has negatively affected our volume-related revenue in that region. The base business yield increases during 2004 have been partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations. This decline is primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste, particularly in the South and Midwest, which has been partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal. In 2003, the increase in base business yield as compared to 2002 was attributable to our collection, transfer and waste-to-energy businesses, with a significant increase in our residential collection operations. Certain of these price increases related to additional costs and taxes were passed on to our customers. However, the increase was partially offset by our landfill business, where we experienced decreases in price-related revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations, mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the Southern and Western portions of the United States. Commodity — Our revenues in both 2004 and 2003 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process. Average prices for old corrugated cardboard were up approximately 33% during the year, from $64 per ton in 2003 to $85 per ton in 2004. Average prices for old newsprint have also improved year-over-year by approximately 25%, from $69 per ton in 2003 to $86 per ton in 2004. However, a significant portion of increases from commodity prices is rebated to our suppliers, thereby increasing our cost of goods sold resulting in a relatively small impact to our income from operations. Fuel surcharges and fees — We experienced revenue improvements during 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by approximately $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. These increases were more than offset by increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices as discussed in Operating Expenses — Fuel. Volume — During 2004, we experienced significant volume-related revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses, driven principally by our Southern and Western Groups. A substantial portion of volume-related revenue growth is due to the volume increases each of our operating groups has experienced in its industrial collection operations. In the Southern and Western portions of the United States, our residential collection and transfer volumes have also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout the year. Additionally, hurricane clean-up efforts increased the Southern Group’s 2004 volume-related revenues by approximately $115 million. Landfill volume increases have also provided significant revenue improvements during 2004. The volume increases in our landfill business have been the most significant in the South and West, where increases in both construction and demolition waste and special waste have been substantial. Excluding the impact of hurricanes, we believe that a relatively strong economic environment has driven our volume-related revenue improvements. Our revenue due to volumes decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily in our collection and recycling businesses. We believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition, particularly in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the United States. Our loss of a contract with the City of Chicago during February 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling, accounting for lost revenues of approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills, primarily in the Southern and Western portions of the United States. Acquisitions — In 2004, the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. Other acquisitions of recycling, transfer and waste-to-energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004. In 2003, we also acquired the Peltz Group, the largest privately-held recycler in the United States. 32 Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Shown Below) Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits, which include salaries and wages, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to both equipment and facilities; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oils to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; and (viii) other operating costs, which include equipment and facility rent, property taxes, insurance and claims costs and landfill operating costs. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Labor and related benefits $ 2,915 $ 141 5.1 % $ 2,774 $ 78 2.9 % $ 2,696 Transfer and disposal costs 1,277 89 7.5 1,188 56 4.9 1,132 Maintenance and repairs 706 14 2.0 692 15 2.2 677 Subcontractor costs 887 189 27.1 698 51 7.9 647 Cost of goods sold 620 123 24.7 497 201 67.9 296 Fuel 401 79 24.5 322 47 17.1 275 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 629 29 4.8 600 59 10.9 541 Other 793 (27 ) (3.3 ) 820 135 19.7 685 $ 8,228 $ 637 8.4 % $ 7,591 $ 642 9.2 % $ 6,949 When comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 to other periods, our 2002 restructuring, as discussed below within Restructuring, resulted in the re-characterization of certain labor and facility-related costs. Through March 31, 2002, these costs were included within other selling, general and administrative costs. After the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since April 1, 2002, when the organizational changes became effective. The components of operating expenses impacted are labor and related benefits as well as other operating expenses. Labor and related benefits — After excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling, general and administrative costs as discussed above, these costs have increased year-over year as a result of (i) higher salaries and hourly wages when compared with the prior year due to annual merit increases; (ii) increased overtime costs due in part to increased volumes; and (iii) salary and hourly wage costs related to acquisitions. Additionally, the increases in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2003 have been partially offset by savings realized as a result of our 2003 workforce reductions. Transfer and disposal costs — The increases are due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions. Subcontractor costs — These cost increases during 2004 as compared with the prior year are primarily due to higher volumes we have experienced throughout the year, including increased subcontractor costs of approximately $78 million in 2004 attributable to hurricane clean-up services provided by our Southern Group. Also contributing to the increases are (i) the impact of acquisitions; (ii) increased third-party transportation costs in our Western Group due to the service requirements of certain event work; (iii) higher fuel surcharges paid to third party subcontractors; and (iv) additional transportation costs in our Eastern Group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills. 33 In 2003, we also experienced, to a lesser extent, the effects of the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints in the Eastern Group. Additionally, we had increased subcontractor costs in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to (i) increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business; (ii) general volume increases; and (iii) increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services. Cost of goods sold — Our Recycling Group provides our suppliers with rebates that are driven by market prices of recyclable commodities, which means that the increase in cost of goods sold correlates directly to the increase in the market prices of these commodities and our revenue yield. Fuel — We experienced an average increase of $0.30 per gallon for 2004 as compared with 2003 and in 2003 we experienced an average increase of $0.19 per gallon over 2002. However, a significant portion of this cost increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers, which are reflected as fuel price increases within our Operating Revenues section above. Other operating expenses — The primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the impact of the December 31, 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three waste-to-energy facilities. Prior to the consolidation of these entities, we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases. The consolidation of these entities has, therefore, resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004, which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation, interest expense and minority interest expense. Additionally, in 2004, we experienced increased landfill and environmental costs, but had partially offsetting gains from the sale of certain assets. After excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling, general and administrative costs as discussed above, the increase in 2003 other operating expenses over 2002 is partially attributable to (i) increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately $24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of SFAS No. 143 and (ii) increased risk management expenses of approximately $20 million largely as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, and payroll taxes; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit, and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage, and printing. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period to Period to 2004 Period Change 2003 Period Change 2002 Labor and related benefits $ 741 $ 15 2.1 % $ 726 $ (55 ) (7.0 )% $ 781 Professional fees 169 18 11.9 151 (8 ) (5.0 ) 159 Provision for bad debts 48 2 4.3 46 2 4.5 44 Other 309 16 5.5 293 (115 ) (28.2 ) 408 $ 1,267 $ 51 4.2 % $ 1,216 $ (176 ) (12.6 )% $ 1,392 Labor and related benefits — We realized an increase in labor and related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the prior year primarily attributable to (i) increased commissions paid to our sales personnel; (ii) higher salaries and hourly wages that were partially offset by the 2003 workforce reduction; and (iii) higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance for 2004. A decline in our use of contract labor has partially offset these increases. 34 During the year ended December 31, 2003, the overall reduction in labor and related benefits was a result of reductions in salary and other labor-related costs, which were primarily derived from our March 2002 reorganization and February and June 2003 restructurings. Professional fees — We experienced increases in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of higher litigation and defense costs and consulting fees for both general business reasons and our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We did not see a significant fluctuation in professional fees between the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Other selling, general and administrative costs — During 2003, we obtained favorable settlements for legal disputes, which are driving the apparent increase in costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. After excluding this impact, we have maintained our cost reduction efforts that were put in place in 2003. In 2003, management focused on reducing spending related to travel and entertainment and other administrative costs. This focus on cost reduction is a primary factor for the lower other selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with 2002. Additionally, in 2002 we experienced increases in our legal reserves that resulted in an unfavorable effect on results as compared with 2003. Also, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 to other periods, our 2002 restructuring, as discussed below within Restructuring, resulted in the re-characterization of certain labor and facility-related costs. Through March 31, 2002, these costs were included within other selling, general and administrative costs. After the adoption of the new organizational structure, these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since April 1, 2002, which is when the organizational changes became effective. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset; (ii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (iii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site; and (iv) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to (i) an increase in our landfill amortization rate, net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs, of $0.19 per ton, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes; (ii) increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise-wide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003; and (iii) increased depreciation expense for our Wheelabrator Group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities. The increase in our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization in 2004 was partially offset by the impact of approximately $18 million of incremental changes related to our final capping, closure and post closure obligations due to (i) the addition of new landfill expansions and the removal of certain expansions from the landfill cost base; (ii) permit modifications; (iii) the settlement of final capping events; and (iv) changes in certain estimates that are derived from an annual review which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year. Depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003. Restructuring In 2002, we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic Groups to better align collection, transport, recycling and disposal resources. As part of the restructuring, we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1,900 field-level administrative and operational 35 positions. In 2002, we recorded $38 million in pre-tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure. These charges included $36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and $2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements. All payments related to this restructuring have been made. In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating Groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization. As a result, we incurred approximately $20 million in one-time employee severance and benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by the February 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in June 2003. We recorded $24 million of pre-tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003. During 2004, we recorded a $1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with these workforce reductions. As of December 31, 2004, substantially all obligations associated with the February restructuring and workforce reduction have been paid. The first quarter of 2005 is the final period we are obligated to make any severance payments to employees associated with the February 2003 reorganization and workforce reduction. Approximately $1 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2004 for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the June 2003 workforce reduction, which will be paid to certain employees through the third quarter of 2005. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items In 2004, the net gain of $13 million for asset impairments and unusual items related to (i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs; (ii) $15 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain Port-O-Let operations; and (iii) $15 million of gains in 2004 related to adjustments we made to our estimated obligations associated with our Non-NASW Divested Operations and our receipt of cash from a third-party for a previously settled remedial obligation. During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of $13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset, in part, by $5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges. In 2002, the net gain of $34 million for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to (i) our receipt of approximately $11 million related to a previously impaired, non-revenue producing asset, (ii) net gains of approximately $8 million on divestitures during the year and (iii) reductions to legal reserves of approximately $8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately $7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Canadian, Wheelabrator and Recycling Groups. These Groups, when combined with certain other operations, comprise our NASW operations. The operations not managed through our seven operating Groups are presented herein as “Other NASW.” As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, charges associated with our restructuring and workforce reductions impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002. The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended December 31 36 for each respective period and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Canadian $ 67 $ (9 ) (11.8 )% $ 76 $ 39 105.4 % $ 37 Eastern 337 20 6.3 317 (123 ) (28.0 ) 440 Midwest 358 5 1.4 353 (43 ) (10.9 ) 396 Southern 665 63 10.5 602 12 2.0 590 Western 390 22 6.0 368 (7 ) (1.9 ) 375 Wheelabrator 283 54 23.6 229 20 9.6 209 Recycling 25 32 457.1 (7 ) (9 ) (450.0 ) 2 Other NASW (19 ) 7 26.9 (26 ) 12 31.6 (38 ) Total NASW $ 2,106 $ 194 10.1 % $ 1,912 $ (99 ) (4.9 )% $ 2,011 Canadian — While general economic factors, such as foreign currency rates, favorably affected operating results year-over-year, a favorable legal settlement of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of $26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of these changes. Eastern — Operating income improvement from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by (i) revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business, partially offset by volume declines in transfer, residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year; (ii) higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 due to the first quarter’s harsh weather conditions; and (iii) acquisitions. These earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste, higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill. The most significant factors affecting the decline from 2002 to 2003 were (i) lower collection and landfill volumes; (ii) increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the United States; (iii) general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs; and (iv) harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003. Midwest — Lower operating income in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily due to (i) the harsh winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2003 (ii) soft economic conditions leading to lower volume; and (iii) an increase in competitive activity leading to price roll-backs and lost business. These economic and competitive pressures continued to impact the Midwest’s results during 2004. Southern — Operating income in 2004 has been favorably affected by (i) positive internal revenue growth, largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations; (ii) acquisitions; (iii) increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter; (iv) favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004, largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004; and (v) various operating and administrative cost reductions. These improvements were partially offset by the write-off of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004. Results for the Southern Group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003. Western — The 2004 increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth, which is largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations. These gains were partially offset by (i) increased labor costs; (ii) higher fuel costs not passed on to customers; and (iii) increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs. Results for the Western Group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003. Wheelabrator — The increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to (i) positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long-term disposal contracts and (ii) the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on December 31, 2003, which has increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs, partially offset by 37 increases in depreciation expense (the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense). Wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an $11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement, which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented. Recycling — The Recycling Group’s 2004 operating revenues have been favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for recycling commodities. Improvements in the market prices for these commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers. These favorable market conditions were the primary drivers of the current year’s increase in earnings. Other Components of Income Before Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles The following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Interest expense, net $ 385 $ (42 ) 9.8 % $ 427 $ (19 ) (4.3 )% $ 446 Equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities 98 102 * (4 ) 2 (33.3 ) (6 ) Minority interest 36 30 * 6 (1 ) (14.3 ) 7 Other, net 2 14 * (12 ) 33 * (45 ) Provision for income taxes 247 (157 ) * 404 (18 ) (4.3 ) 422 * Percentage change not meaningful. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. Interest Expense, net In 2004, net interest expense decreased approximately $42 million when compared with 2003, which is due to a $58 million increase in interest income from $12 million in 2003 to $70 million in 2004. This increase is due primarily to interest income of $46 million realized on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. Partially offsetting the benefit of the current year increase in interest income is a $16 million increase in interest expense, which is primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on December 31, 2003 as a result of our implementation of FIN 46. The decline in net interest expense in 2003 when compared with 2002 can be largely attributed to our increased utilization of tax-exempt financing, which contributed to a decline in our weighted average interest rate for the period. For all periods, we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts, which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense reductions of approximately $90 million for 2004, approximately $96 million for 2003 and approximately $86 million for 2002. While we expect the benefits of our interest rate derivative contracts to continue in 2005, the benefit derived from our interest rate contracts will be impacted by changes in short-term rates on our active agreements and will decline as the debt associated with terminated contracts matures. Of the $90 million in reductions to interest expense realized in 2004 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements, $48 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $42 million in 2005, $41 million in 2006 and $37 million in 2007. Equity in Losses (Earnings) of Unconsolidated Entities In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. We account for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting 38 and their related losses are the reason for the 2004 versus 2003 change in equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities. These equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for Income Taxes. If, for any reason, the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, we would no longer incur these equity losses. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Minority Interest The increase in 2004 minority interest expense over prior years was primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities on December 31, 2003 as a result of our implementation of FIN 46. This increase was more than offset by an increase in our income from operations as a result of consolidating the entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Other, net Our other income and expense in 2003 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation. We experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 due primarily to the sale of an equity investment. In 2002, a company in which we held an approximately 17% interest was acquired by another entity. We also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition. The proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $247 million for 2004, $404 million for 2003 and $422 million for 2002 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 21.0%, 36.0% and 34.0% for each of the three years, respectively. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2004 is primarily due to (i) the realization of non-conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills and our investments in the coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities discussed above within equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities; and (ii) the realization of a net benefit of approximately $101 million for tax audit settlements that occurred during the year; offset in part by (iii) state and local income taxes. The decrease of approximately $131 million in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in the coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities discussed above. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset in part by non-conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills. Additionally, in 2003 we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits. In 2002, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture. A tax benefit of approximately $31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carry-back of losses by our Dutch subsidiary. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of approximately $8 million, net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by FIN 46. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 39 In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively, to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below. • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded approximately $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we recorded approximately $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. • In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded approximately $101 million, including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs. • In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded approximately $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. For a discussion of these variable interest entities see Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a credit of $2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. Liquidity and Capital Resources General As an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations. However, we operate in a capital-intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: • the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; • our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; • our liquidity profile; • our asset base; and • our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; and (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills. Beginning in 2002, we committed ourselves to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment 40 through our share repurchase program, and in 2004 began a quarterly dividend program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. We also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) became law. A provision of the Act temporarily reduces the tax rate on repatriated income if the income is permanently reinvested in the U.S. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this legislation, which includes an analysis of the funds provided by our Canadian operations available for repatriation. However, we do not expect this legislation to materially impact our consolidated liquidity position. Summary of Cash, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 (in millions): 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 443 $ 217 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 333 $ 465 Closure, post-closure and remediation funds 213 186 Debt service funds 83 89 Other 18 12 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 647 $ 752 Debt: Current portion $ 384 $ 514 Long-term portion 8,182 7,997 Total debt $ 8,566 $ 8,511 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 135 $ 168 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trusts and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection with landfill closure, post-closure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within long-term other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. Debt — Revolving credit and letter of credit facilities — The table below summarizes the credit capacity, maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and principal letter of credit facilities outstanding at December 31, 2004 (in millions). We also had an additional $88 million in 41 outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004 that have been issued under various arrangements, none of which provide for committed capacity. Outstanding Total Credit Letters of Facility Capacity Maturity Credit Five-year revolving credit facility(a) $ 2,400 October 2009 $ 1,366 Five-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 15 June 2008 15 Five-year letter of credit facility(b) 350 December 2008 349 Seven-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 175 June 2010 166 Ten-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 105 June 2013 101 Total $ 3,045 $ 1,997 (a) This facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and we had unused and available credit capacity of approximately $1,034 million. (b) These facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility. Through December 31, 2004 we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit. We have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain tax-exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste management contracts, closure and post-closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit. We expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future, and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs. On October 15, 2004, we renegotiated our three-year, $650 million and five-year, $1.75 billion revolving credit facilities, replacing them with a single, five-year, $2.4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility. Senior notes — During March 2004 we issued $350 million of 5.0% senior notes due March 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $346 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and expenses. We used these proceeds to repay $150 million of 8.0% senior notes due April 30, 2004 and $200 million of 6.5% senior notes due May 15, 2004. With cash on hand, we repaid $295 million of 7.0% senior notes that matured on October 1, 2004. We have $100 million of 7.0% senior notes and $3 million of 6.65% senior notes both due May 15, 2005 that we currently expect to redeem with available cash. Tax-exempt bonds — As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $2,047 million of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. We issued approximately $345 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2004, $35 million of which was issued to refinance higher rate tax-exempt bonds. We actively issue tax-exempt bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital expenditures. The proceeds from these financing arrangements are deposited directly into trust funds and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services. As we spend monies on the specific projects being financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds. As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above, we have approximately $333 million held in trust for future spending as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, we received $442 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $590 million of our tax-exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility, that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. During the second quarter of 2004, we fixed the interest rates of approximately $379 million of tax-exempt bonds that had previously been remarketed on a weekly basis. 42 Because our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds require letter of credit support, fixing the interest rates of these debt instruments resulted in a decrease in our financial assurance needs. Tax-exempt project bonds — As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $496 million of outstanding tax-exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of waste-to-energy facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments. As of December 31 2004, approximately $46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. Repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five-year revolving credit facility. Approximately $91 million of these bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months. Convertible subordinated notes — We had approximately $35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid, with cash on hand, upon maturity on January 24, 2005. Interest rate swaps — We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, the interest payments on approximately $2.6 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately 63% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 37% at variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2004 and approximately $168 million at December 31, 2003. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,218 $ 1,926 $ 2,153 Net cash used in investing activities $ (863 ) $ (1,084 ) $ (962 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,130 ) $ (986 ) $ (1,588 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — During both 2003 and 2002, cash generated from operations was positively affected by cash we received of approximately $109 million and $166 million, respectively, from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities. The positive cash receipts during 2002 were offset partially by cash payments of approximately $66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances. Cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a $223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003. Settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during 2003 includes: (i) a final net cash settlement payment, net of insurance proceeds of $377 million plus accrued interest; (ii) a total tax benefit of approximately $138 million and (iii) related net settlement recoveries of approximately $16 million. After adjusting 2003 and 2002 for the unusual items mentioned above, our 2004 cash flows from operations increased $178 million over 2003 and $165 million over 2002. Our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships are the primary contributors of this increase. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The primary contributor to the variation in cash used in investing activities is acquisition spending, which was $130 million in 2004, $337 million in 2003 and $162 million in 2002. In recent years, our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck-in acquisitions, which are 43 relatively small, accretive businesses that will easily integrate with, and provide value to, our existing operations. However, our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuck-in acquisitions, particularly in our recycling line-of-business. Our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets, which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins. We intend to continue to make accretive tuck-in investments and expect acquisition spending in 2005 to be approximately $250 million. In addition to decreased acquisition spending, net receipts from restricted trust fund and escrow accounts in 2004 have increased $73 million over 2003 and $171 million over 2002. As discussed above, our restricted trust and escrow accounts are related to our (i) tax-exempt bonds; (ii) closure, post-closure and remedial requirements; or (iii) debt service requirements. The increase in cash received from these sources is due to increased utilization of this type of financing, which is a direct result of the favorable interest rates available. Our capital expenditures have been maintained at a manageable range of annual spending of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We anticipate that our capital expenditures during 2005 will be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Additionally, we continue to receive cash proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets. In January of 2005, we received proceeds of approximately $89 million for the divestiture of one of our landfills due to a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Bureau. From time to time, we may be required to divest of certain assets due to governmental regulations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The primary reason for the increase in net cash used in financing activities is the payment of our quarterly dividends, which resulted in cash dividends of $432 million in 2004 compared with cash dividends of $6 million paid in each of 2003 and 2002. Our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend program in August 2003, and we have declared and paid a dividend of $0.1875 per share of common stock in each quarter of 2004, compared with the annual $0.01 per share dividend in 2003 and 2002. Additionally, the Board of Directors announced that it expects dividends to be $0.20 per share per quarter beginning in 2005. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. On January 28, 2005, the Board declared our first quarterly dividend under the program of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on March 24, 2005 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2005. Offsetting the increase in cash dividend payments were decreases in share repurchases and net debt repayments and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants. We paid approximately $496 million for share repurchases in 2004 as compared to $550 million paid during 2003 and $982 million paid in 2002. Our 2004 share repurchases include a cash payment of approximately $24 million to settle repurchases made in December 2003. Our 2004 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a capital allocation program that authorized management to spend up to $1 billion for this activity during the year. Since the inception of the repurchase program in February 2002, we have repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately $2 billion. We currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above. Future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations. Net debt repayments were approximately $386 million in 2004, $456 million in 2003 and $697 million in 2002. The following summary shows our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during 2004: • proceeds of approximately $346 million from the March 2004 issuance of $350 million of 5.0% senior notes; 44 • repayment of $150 million of 8.0% senior notes that matured in April 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes that matured in May 2004 and $295 million of 7.0% senior notes that matured in October 2004; and • repayments of approximately $25 million of tax-exempt bonds and $42 million of tax-exempt project bonds. Cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises increased to $193 million in 2004 from $52 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. Increased cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises were driven by the increase in our stock price during the year. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 100 $ 88 $ 95 $ 87 $ 87 $ 1,316 $ 1,773 Environmental remediation 62 49 30 16 13 194 364 162 137 125 103 100 1,510 2,137 Debt payments(b),(c) 382 491 526 535 684 5,824 8,442 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 102 91 81 65 57 927 1,323 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(e) 211 192 107 101 101 436 1,148 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2004 $ 857 $ 911 $ 839 $ 804 $ 942 $ 8,697 $ 13,050 a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2004 include approximately $380 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation. However, these bonds have been classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. The classification of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use our $2.4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. c) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, approximately $83 million of these future debt payments will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as other assets within our December 31, 2004 balance sheet. d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. e) Our unconditional purchase obligations are generally quantity driven. We have therefore made estimates of our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies. 45 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to (i) lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities and (ii) guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive, market-driven prices. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2004 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer, such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004, actually increase our revenues in the areas affected, although, for several reasons, including significant start-up costs, such revenues tend to provide lower margins. Conversely, harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. We believe that inflation has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2004, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. 46 An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $490 million at December 31, 2004 and $440 million at December 31, 2003. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately $647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short-terms of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt. There would have been no material impact to our fair value position if there were an instantaneous 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 we have no foreign currency derivatives outstanding. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled products such as waste paper, aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings, as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy, which governs the type of instruments that may be used. An instantaneous 10% increase in recyclable material prices would decrease the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately $10 million at December 31, 2003 and by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2004. This analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity positions that are being hedged. See Notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 47",2023-12-30 20:45:12.658075
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2005. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Waste Management is the leading provider of comprehensive waste services in North America. Throughout 2005, we continued to build a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality, reliable service, safety and environmental protection. By continuing to cultivate this reputation and focusing on quality customer service, we accomplished our main financial objectives for 2005 of strong earnings growth, margin expansion and improved cash flow. We believe that our pricing initiatives, which allowed us to grow our revenues by increasing our prices while maintaining solid volumes, were largely responsible for our improved financial performance. Significant financial achievements during the year ended December 31, 2005 include: • Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $2.4 billion and free cash flow increased to $1.4 billion, increases of 8% and 33%, respectively, when compared with 2004; • Internal revenue growth of 4.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 3.7% for the full year, driven by increases in base business yield, which is the highest it has been in five years; • Improvements in our costs as a percentage of revenues, particularly in the second half of the year, despite margin pressure created by continued increases in the cost of fuel; and • $706 million in stock repurchases and $449 million of dividends paid pursuant to our capital allocation plan. Cash Flow — Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance that we include in our disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we produce from non-financing activities that is available for our acquisition program, share repurchase program, scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends. The most comparable GAAP financial measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,391 $ 2,218 Capital expenditures (1,180 ) (1,258 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets 194 96 Free cash flow $ 1,405 $ 1,056 The growth in our 2005 operating and free cash flow reflects the current year improvements in our operating results, particularly those contributed by our increase in revenue from price, which is discussed below. Internal Revenue Growth — Internal revenue growth, or IRG, is the change in our revenues from: base business yield; commodities; electricity; fuel surcharges and fees; and volumes. IRG is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations. Our IRG for the year was 3.7% and consisted primarily of improvement in base business yield and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge program. Revenue growth from yield on base business is the combined effects on our revenues from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, disposal and waste-to-energy 23 Table of Contents operations, exclusive of volume changes. Our revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases, but also includes (i) price decreases to retain customers; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided. Our revenue growth from base business yield for 2005 was 2.7%, which is an increase of 2 percentage points from the prior year. In addition, our fuel surcharge program contributed $157 million, or 1.3%, to revenue growth in 2005 compared with $53 million, or 0.5% in 2004. The revenues generated by the program in 2005 substantially recovered the increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel. Margin Improvement — We use our net income as a percentage of revenues and income from operations as a percentage of revenues to gauge performance for employee incentive awards and to determine the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and strategies. Our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as a percentage of revenues increased in 2005 to 9.0% from 7.4% in 2004. This increase is largely due to a tax benefit resulting from tax audit settlements. Our income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 13.1% in 2005 from 13.6% in 2004 on an increase of $558 million in revenue. The decrease was caused primarily by $110 million of additional expenses in 2005 when compared with 2004 related to asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring. Excluding asset impairments and unusual items and restructuring charges for both periods, our income from operations as a percentage of revenues improved by 0.3 percentage points. This improvement in our income from operations as a percentage of revenues is primarily a result of our increased revenue on essentially flat volumes. We experienced a $403 million increase in our operating expenses from the prior year, but as a percentage of revenue, the measure increased by only 0.3 percentage points, to 66%, as compared with 2004. During the second half of 2005, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 0.4 percentage points when compared with the comparable prior year period. With the increased prices of fuel and other higher variable operating costs, we believe that these are positive results brought about primarily by our focus on implementing programs to recover our own higher costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 increased by $9 million, but as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 9.8%. We achieved our goal of reducing selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to below 10% as a result of both our revenue growth and our restructuring to streamline our business. As a result of higher revenues on relatively flat volumes, our depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points as compared with the prior period. Although there remains work to be done, we believe our 2005 operating margins demonstrate our pricing progress as well as our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations. Outlook for 2006 As part of our continuing efforts to improve our operations, we have developed a program to divest under-performing and non-strategic operations. In the third quarter of 2005, we identified operations with annual gross revenues of over $400 million for potential divestiture under this program. We recently announced that we have identified additional assets, representing over $500 million in annual gross revenues, that may also be sold as part of the divestiture program. While it is too early to assess the financial impact of the divestitures, and whether there may be any material asset impairments as a result of the program, we remain confident that our “fix or seek an exit strategy” approach to any under-performing operations will benefit our financial results in the long term. Additionally, we are continuing our focus on acquisitions and other investments. We intend to make investments in those locations and lines of businesses that offer superior margins and return on capital. Our Company is proud of the accomplishments made in 2005. We are focused on building on the momentum that we experienced this year to continue to expand our operating margins, increase our return on invested capital and generate strong cash flows. 24 Table of Contents Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following reclassifications have been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year financial information with the current period presentation. Cash balances — During 2004, we began making investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. Through December 31, 2004, we included these investments in “Cash and cash equivalents.” As a result of guidance issued in early 2005 associated with these types of securities, we determined that these investments were more appropriately classified as short-term investments, which are a component of current “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements we have decreased our “Cash and cash equivalents” and increased our current “Other assets” by $19 million at December 31, 2004. Gross purchases and sales of these investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, in our 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, relatively insignificant purchases and sales of other short-term investments were included on a net basis within “Cash flows from investing activities — Other.” This additional activity is now reflected within purchases and sales of short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Segments — As discussed in Notes 2 and 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in the third quarter of 2005, we eliminated our Canadian Group office, and the management of our Canadian operations was allocated among our Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups. We have allocated the operating results of our Canadian operations to the Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups for 2003, 2004 and the first half of 2005 to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations. This reorganization also resulted in the centralization of certain Group office functions. The administrative costs associated with these functions were included in the measurement of income from operations for our reportable segments through August 2005, when the integration of these functions with our existing centralized processes was completed. Beginning in September 2005, these administrative costs have been included in the income from operations of our Corporate organization. The reallocation of these costs has not significantly affected the operating results of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Certain other reclassifications have also been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year information with the current period presentation. The supplementary financial information included in this section has been updated to reflect these changes. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below. Landfills — The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (“SFAS No. 143”), based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because 25 Table of Contents landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. They then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. However, as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Available Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills. The available airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the final landfill topography. Once the remaining airspace is determined, an airspace utilization factor (AUF) is established to calculate the remaining capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; 26 Table of Contents • Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 65 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2005, 16 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Thirteen of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because legal, community or other issues could impede the expansion process. The remaining three landfills required approval primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one or five year requirements, generally due to state-specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs at our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available, permitted and likely expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information 27 Table of Contents with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: • A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; • A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; • A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; • An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; • Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or • A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of our business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of our reporting unit’s (Group’s) identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. Self-insurance reserves and recoveries — We have retained a portion of the risks related to our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator (which includes our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs) and Recycling Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year from our six operating Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Eastern $ 3,809 $ 3,744 $ 3,591 Midwest 3,054 2,971 2,840 Southern 3,590 3,480 3,149 Western 3,079 2,884 2,725 Wheelabrator 879 835 819 Recycling 833 745 567 Other 296 261 220 Intercompany (2,466 ) (2,404 ) (2,263 ) Total $ 13,074 $ 12,516 $ 11,648 Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling services. Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site, and are normally billed monthly. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our four geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Collection $ 8,633 $ 8,318 $ 7,782 Landfill 3,089 3,004 2,834 Transfer 1,756 1,680 1,582 Wheelabrator 879 835 819 Recycling and other 1,183 1,083 894 Intercompany (2,466 ) (2,404 ) (2,263 ) Total $ 13,074 $ 12,516 $ 11,648 31 Table of Contents The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change for Change for 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Average yield: Base business $ 336 2.7 % $ 85 0.7 % Commodity (38 ) (0.3 ) 143 1.2 Electricity (IPPs) 4 — 2 — Fuel surcharges and fees 161 1.3 53 0.5 Total 463 3.7 283 2.4 Volume 3 — 340 3.0 Internal growth 466 3.7 623 5.4 Acquisitions 112 0.9 233 2.0 Divestitures (62 ) (0.5 ) (27 ) (0.2 ) Foreign currency translation 42 0.3 39 0.3 $ 558 4.4 % $ 868 7.5 % Base Business — In 2005, base business yield improvements were driven by our collection operations, where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating group. The significant base business yield improvements in the collection line of business are primarily the result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives as a means of increasing our margins, cash flows and return on capital and, to a lesser extent, the adoption of a 1% environmental cost recovery fee, which increased revenues by $33 million during 2005. Our transfer business in the East and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the South have also provided significant revenue growth from base business yield improvements throughout the year. During the second half of 2005, we received substantial yield contributions to revenues from our waste-to-energy facilities. These revenue improvements were largely due to significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under our long-term contracts with electric utilities. These rates are generally indexed to natural gas prices, which increased significantly in 2005 as a result of hurricane related production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude oil prices. The 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield have been partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste landfill disposal operations, noted principally in our Midwest and Southern Groups. In 2004, base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection, transfer and waste-to-energy operations. In our collection business, the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations, where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements. Although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 was positive, it was affected by increased price competition, particularly in the Midwest, and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the South. The base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 were almost exclusively attributable to the Eastern portion of the United States. Base business yield increases during 2004 were partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations. This decline was primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste, particularly in the South and Midwest, which was partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal. Commodity — Our revenues in 2005 declined due to price decreases in recycling commodities. Average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8% during the year, from $85 per ton in 2004 to $78 per ton in 2005. Average prices for old newsprint were also down by about 3%, from $86 per ton in 2004 to $83 per ton in 2005. Conversely, our revenues in 2004 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process. 32 Table of Contents A significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials. Accordingly, changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold. Fuel surcharges and fees — Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. The substantial current year increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to (i) increases in market prices for fuel; (ii) an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program; and (iii) the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors. During the year ended December 31, 2005, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices, which are included within both Operating Expenses — Subcontractor Costs and Operating Expenses — Fuel, were substantially recovered by our fuel surcharge program. Volume — Volume-related revenues are relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004. This is generally because of the combined impacts of (i) a decline in revenues associated with hurricanes; (ii) increases in recycling and landfill disposal volumes; and (iii) lower revenue from residential, commercial and industrial collection volumes, particularly in the East and Midwest, which can generally be attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing yield. Our volume-related revenues generated from hurricane related services were $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $59 million decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain of our operations in the Gulf Coast region during 2005 as a result of the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues were associated with subcontracted services, which generated comparatively lower margins. In 2005, we generally elected not to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not support the required services with internal resources. When excluding the impacts of the hurricanes, revenue due to volume increased $62 million, or 0.5% during 2005. Current year volume-related revenue increases have largely been due to (i) increased recycling volumes provided by several new brokerage contracts; (ii) increased landfill disposal volumes in the Midwest, West and South; (iii) increased transfer station volumes in the West and the South; and (iv) increased residential collection volumes in the West. Also included as a component of volume-related revenue growth is revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in our Midwest Group. The revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. These revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines experienced in each line of business in the Eastern portion of the United States and significant volume declines in our collection business in the Midwest. We believe volume declines in our collection and transfer businesses in the East and Midwest can generally be attributed to our focus on improving base business yield and the price competition typical in these regions. During 2004, we experienced significant volume-related revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses. A substantial portion of volume-related revenue growth was due to the volume increases experienced in industrial collection operations for each of our operating Groups. In the Southern and Western portions of the United States, our residential collection, transfer, construction and demolition disposal and special waste landfill disposal operations also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout 2004. Acquisitions and divestitures — During the year ended December 31, 2005, acquisitions contributed $112 million of additional revenues offset by a decline in revenue of $62 million during the year as a result of divestitures. We expect the decrease in revenues attributable to divestitures to increase in future periods as a result of our plan to divest under-performing or non-strategic operations. In 2004, the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. Other acquisitions of recycling, transfer and waste-to-energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004. 33 Table of Contents Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Shown Below) Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below), which include salaries and wages, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include landfill remediation costs, leachate and methane collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Labor and related benefits $ 2,471 $ 84 3.5 % $ 2,387 $ 129 5.7 % $ 2,258 Transfer and disposal costs 1,270 (19 ) (1.5 ) 1,289 101 8.5 1,188 Maintenance and repairs 1,135 35 3.2 1,100 30 2.8 1,070 Subcontractor costs 937 26 2.9 911 190 26.4 721 Cost of goods sold 645 49 8.2 596 122 25.7 474 Fuel 532 131 32.7 401 79 24.5 322 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 642 22 3.5 620 20 3.3 600 Landfill operating costs 233 14 6.4 219 22 11.2 197 Risk management 312 (7 ) (2.2 ) 319 — — 319 Other 454 68 17.6 386 (56 ) (12.7 ) 442 $ 8,631 $ 403 4.9 % $ 8,228 $ 637 8.4 % $ 7,591 Labor and related benefits — When comparing 2005 with 2004, these costs have increased due to (i) salary and wage increases as a result of annual merit increases; (ii) a general increase in employee health care and benefit costs; (iii) an increase in the costs attributable to contract labor used at our material recovery facilities due to acquisitions; and (iv) increased payroll taxes. In 2004, the year-over-year increase in costs was generally due to higher salary costs and higher hourly wage and overtime costs. For purposes of the above disclosure, the presentation of prior years has been conformed to our current year presentation that excludes labor costs related to fleet and container maintenance facilities as well as workers’ compensation costs. Labor costs attributable principally to our fleet and container maintenance facilities of $395 million for 2004 and $376 million for 2003 have been reclassified as a component of the caption “Maintenance and repairs,” and workers’ compensation costs of $131 million for 2004 and $139 million for 2003 have been included as a component of the caption “Risk management.” Transfer and disposal costs — In 2005, the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at third party transfer stations or landfills declined due to our focus on improving internalization. These costs significantly increased in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions. Maintenance and repairs — Increases in these costs are attributable to (i) higher parts and supplies costs, which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities and 34 Table of Contents increased volumes in our Southern and Western Groups; (ii) increases in the cost of lubes and oils; and (iii) increases in the labor costs associated with our maintenance and repairs. Subcontractor costs — Throughout 2005 and 2004 we have experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices, which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third party subcontractors. Subcontractor cost increases attributable to higher fuel costs were significantly offset by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Additionally, in 2005 we incurred additional transportation costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work, particularly in our National Accounts organization and Western Group. The current year cost increases were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing hurricane related services. In addition to the significant increase in subcontractor costs related to hurricane-related services during 2004, we also experienced increases due to (i) the impact of acquisitions; (ii) increased third-party transportation costs in our Western Group due to the service requirements of certain event work; and (iii) additional transportation costs in our Eastern Group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills. Cost of goods sold — These costs are primarily for rebates paid to our suppliers, which are driven by the market prices of recyclable commodities. In 2005, we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior years. This decrease in pricing was more than offset by increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage contracts and recent acquisitions. In 2005, the increase in cost of goods sold was also partially due to costs incurred to construct an integrated waste facility for a municipality in the Midwest Group. The increase in 2004 over 2003 is directly related to the year-over-year increase in market prices of recyclable commodities. Fuel — We experienced an average increase of $0.59 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004 and in 2004 we experienced an average increase of $0.30 per gallon for 2004 over 2003. While we recover a significant portion of the cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices through our fuel surcharge program, increased fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margins. Revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — These cost increases are the result of increased volumes and increased rates for mandated fees and taxes. Certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers, and have been reflected as fee yield increases within Operating Revenues. Landfill operating costs — These cost increases have generally been related to higher site maintenance, leachate collection, monitoring and testing, and closure and post-closure expenses. Risk management — Over the last two years, we have been successful in maintaining these costs at a consistent level largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs, which can partially be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. Other operating expenses — The increase in these costs since 2004 can be attributed to (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs, particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the New Orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts; (ii) a year-over-year decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets; (iii) costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor strikes in New Jersey and Canada; and (iv) an increase in costs generated by a surety bonding company we have consolidated since the third quarter of 2003 under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46”). The primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the December 31, 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities, from which we lease three waste-to-energy facilities. The consolidation of these entities is as a result of our FIN 46 implementation. Prior to the consolidation of these entities, we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases. The consolidation of these entities, therefore, resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004, which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation, interest expense and minority interest expense. 35 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Labor and related benefits $ 757 $ 16 2.2 % $ 741 $ 15 2.1 % $ 726 Professional fees 152 (17 ) (10.1 ) 169 18 11.9 151 Provision for bad debts 52 4 8.3 48 2 4.3 46 Other 315 6 1.9 309 16 5.5 293 $ 1,276 $ 9 0.7 % $ 1,267 $ 51 4.2 % $ 1,216 Labor and related benefits — Throughout 2005 we experienced increases in (i) non-cash compensation costs associated with recent changes in equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plan and (ii) group insurance costs largely due to general health care cost increases. In both 2005 and 2004, these costs increased year-over-year due to higher salaries and hourly wages driven by annual merit raises as well as higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance on a year-over-year basis. Also contributing to the increase in labor costs in 2004 when compared with 2003 was an increase in commissions paid to our sales personnel. Declines in our use of contract labor, particularly for Corporate support functions, partially offset these cost increases for both 2005 and 2004. Additionally, during the second half of 2005 we began to realize the benefits of our July 2005 reorganization, which simplified our management structure to increase the accountability and responsibility of our Market Areas. Our ability to streamline our organization in this manner can be attributed to our continued focus on creating efficiencies with our key personnel. Our 2005 and 2003 restructurings have been a result of identifying the most effective utilization of our resources, and are discussed in the Restructuring section below. Professional fees — In 2004, we experienced an increase in professional fees as a result of higher litigation and defense costs as well as consulting fees that were largely due to our implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The decline in our litigation and defense costs in the current year is due to several cases winding down and either being settled or moving into the settlement stages. Consulting costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance have also decreased as we move from the implementation phase to continued monitoring and testing. In 2005, an increase in consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives and an increase in our computer support costs have partially offset these reductions. Provision for bad debts — As a percentage of revenue, these costs have continued to decline largely due to improved collection efforts. The increase in these costs in 2005 was generally attributable to a year-over-year increase in third-party collection costs. Other selling, general and administrative costs — Although we did not see a significant fluctuation in these costs when comparing 2005 with 2004, increased sales and marketing costs related to our national advertising campaign did result in a notable increase in these expenses in the current year. The recognition of favorable settlements for legal disputes during 2003 drove the increase in these costs from 2003 to 2004. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, 36 Table of Contents including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is largely attributable to a $21 million charge to landfill amortization recorded to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our landfills. These adjustments reflect cumulative corrections resulting from reducing the amortization periods of the landfills and were necessary to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations. We determined that the impact of these adjustments was not material to 2005 or prior periods’ results of operations. Our 2005 landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization also increased when compared with 2004 as a result of the comparative impact of landfill amortization reductions recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping, closure and post closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $12 million and $20 million, respectively, with the majority of the reduced expense resulting from revised estimates associated with final capping changes. Similar adjustments did not significantly affect our landfill amortization expense in 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $71 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 was primarily related to (i) an increase in our landfill amortization rate, net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs, of $0.19 per ton, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes; (ii) increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise-wide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003; and (iii) increased depreciation expense for our Wheelabrator Group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities. Restructuring Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure. These reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could capture by restructuring. The most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. The following summarizes the organizational changes that have occurred during the last three years to reach our current structure. In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating Groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization. As a result, we incurred $20 million in one-time employee severance and benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by the February 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in June 2003. We recorded an additional $24 million of pre-tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003. In 2004, we recorded a $1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with the 2003 workforce reductions. During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number of our operating groups from seven to six. This reorganization has reduced costs at the Group and Corporate offices and increased the accountability of our Market Areas. We recorded $28 million of pre-tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure, principally for employee severance and benefit costs. 37 Table of Contents Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “Asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Asset impairments $ 116 $ 17 $ 5 Net gains on divestitures (79 ) (12 ) (13 ) Other 31 (18 ) — $ 68 $ (13 ) $ (8 ) The significant transactions and events resulting in asset impairments, net gains on divestitures and other financial statement impacts within “Asset impairments and unusual items” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three years ended December 31, 2005 are discussed below: Year Ended December 31, 2005 Asset impairments — During the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a $35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options. After such evaluation and considering the length of time required for the appeal process and the permit application review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial. This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s required closure in 2010. We continued to operate the Pottstown Landfill using existing permitted airspace through the landfill’s permit expiration date of October 2005. The Pottstown Landfill had not been a significant contributor to our recent earnings nor do we expect the expansion denial to have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows. Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and equipment” had included approximately $80 million of accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system. Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use, while the remaining costs were associated with the general efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our existing applications and hardware. The development efforts associated with our revenue management system were suspended in 2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable software alternatives available to address our current needs. During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of potential revenue management system options. As a result, we entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its applications software, including waste and recycling functionality. We believe that these newly licensed applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially better capabilities and functionality than the software we were developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 for the software that had been under development and capitalized costs associated with the development efforts specific to that software. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an $18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software costs related to two applications we decided not to develop further. Net gains on divestitures — During the first quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as a result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada, which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we recognized a total of $40 million in 38 Table of Contents gains as a result of the divestiture of operations. With the exception of our divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill, our divestitures during 2005 were generally part of our plan to review under-performing or non-strategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations. Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which $140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the form of non-monetary assets. We do not believe that these divestitures are material either individually or in the aggregate and we do not expect these divestitures to materially affect our consolidated financial position or future results of operations or cash flows. Other — During the first quarter of 2005, we recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of stockholders that opted not to participate in the 2000 settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of 2005, we settled our ongoing defense costs and any future indemnity obligations for four former officers of WM Holdings related to legacy litigation brought by the SEC against such former officers. As a result, we recorded a $26.8 million charge for the funding of the court ordered distribution to our shareholders for the former officers’ settlement of the litigation. As discussed in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this settlement agreement resulted in a distribution of $27.5 million to WMI shareholders of record as of August 25, 2005. These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a $12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste operations divested in 1999 and 2000. Year Ended December 31, 2004 For 2004, the significant items included within “Asset impairments and unusual items” were (i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs; (ii) $12 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain Port-O-Let® operations; and (iii) $18 million in miscellaneous net gains, which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated obligations associated with non-solid waste services, which were divested in 1999 and 2000. Year Ended December 31, 2003 For 2003, the significant items included within “Asset impairments and unusual items” were $5 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and $13 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to divested operations in the Western Group. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended December 31 for each respective period and provides explanations of factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments’ operating results (in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Eastern $ 361 $ 3 0.8 % $ 358 $ 23 6.9 % $ 335 Midwest 426 40 10.4 386 11 2.9 375 Southern 699 34 5.1 665 63 10.5 602 Western 471 56 13.5 415 19 4.8 396 Wheelabrator 305 22 7.8 283 54 23.6 229 Recycling 15 (10 ) (40.0 ) 25 32 457.1 (7 ) Other 3 15 125.0 (12 ) 8 40.0 (20 ) Corporate (570 ) (149 ) (35.4 ) (421 ) (51 ) (13.8 ) (370 ) Total $ 1,710 $ 11 0.6 % $ 1,699 $ 159 10.3 % $ 1,540 39 Table of Contents Eastern — Operating income was relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004. Current year operating income has been favorably affected by base business yield improvement, particularly in the collection and transfer lines of business and recent tuck-in acquisitions. These operational improvements were offset by (i) the recognition of a net charge of $44 million to “Asset impairments and unusual items,” which was driven by the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill, and (ii) additional operating costs of $9 million attributable to a seven-week labor strike in New Jersey in the first quarter of 2005. In addition, our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during 2005, which reflects the competitive nature of the region and our decision to concentrate on higher margin revenues. The improvement in operating income from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by (i) revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business, partially offset by volume declines in transfer, residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year; (ii) higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 as compared with 2004 due to the first quarter’s harsh weather conditions; and (iii) acquisitions. These earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste, higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill. Midwest — The current year increase in income from operations was primarily due to revenue growth associated with increased base business yield for the collection line of business, which was driven principally by residential collection operations. Also positively affecting results compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. However, our focus on improving base business yield has resulted in partially offsetting volume declines during 2005. Operating income between 2003 and 2004 was relatively flat. The slight increase in operating income in 2004 can largely be attributed to higher operating expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2003 due to harsh winter weather conditions. Southern — Strong internal revenue growth contributed significantly to the increase in income from operations during 2005. The most significant revenue growth was associated with base business yield improvements in the collection line of business and volume-related revenue growth in the transfer and landfill disposal lines of business. In addition, $13 million of the increase in income from operations was attributable to gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decline in earnings related to hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina; (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs, generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations; (iii) higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations; and (iv) increases in salaries and wages. Operating income in 2004 was favorably affected by (i) positive internal revenue growth, largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations; (ii) acquisitions; (iii) increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter; (iv) favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004, largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004; and (v) various operating and administrative cost reductions. These improvements were partially offset by a charge to “Asset impairments and unusual items” for the write-off of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004. Western — The significant increase in income from operations in 2005 can partially be attributed to internal revenue growth, which was driven by yield improvements in commercial and industrial collection operations and volume growth in residential collection and transfer operations. In addition, during 2005, we recognized $24 million of gains associated with the divestiture of operations, an increase of approximately $14 million from 2004. These earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs, particularly for labor and related benefits. The increase in operating income between 2003 and 2004 was primarily attributable to revenue growth, which was largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and 40 Table of Contents average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations. These gains were partially offset by (i) increased labor costs; (ii) higher fuel costs not passed on to customers; and (iii) increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs. Wheelabrator — The electric rates we charge to our customers at our waste-to-energy facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of 2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas, which increased significantly as a result of hurricane-related production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude oil prices. This increase in rates was the principal reason for the current year increase in Wheelabrator’s income from operations. The favorable impact of market prices for natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing of work performed in 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to (i) positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long-term disposal contracts and (ii) the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on December 31, 2003, which increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs, partially offset by increases in depreciation expense (the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense). Wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an $11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement, which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented. Recycling — The decrease in income from operations in our Recycling Group during 2005 when compared with the prior year can generally be attributed to (i) an increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased competition; (ii) costs related to the deployment of new software; and (iii) higher subcontractor costs primarily related to increased distances traveled by third-party truckers. The comparability of operating results for the Recycling Group for all of the periods presented above has been affected by variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities. During the three years ended December 31, 2005, year-over-year changes in the quarterly average market prices of OCC and ONP have ranged from a decrease of as much as 37% to an increase of as much as 36%. In 2004, our operating revenues were favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for these commodities. Improvements in the market prices for recycable commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers. Other — The increase in income from operations from prior years is due to a pre-tax gain of $39 million resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada during the first quarter of 2005. This impact is included in “Asset impairments and unusual items” within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization, historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments. Accordingly, these impacts have been included in Other. Partially offsetting this gain are certain year-end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. Corporate — The higher expenses in the current year were driven primarily by impairment charges of $68 million associated with capitalized software costs and $31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters. These items are discussed in the Asset Impairments and Unusual Items section above. Also contributing to the increase in expenses during 2005 were (i) an increase in non-cash employee compensation costs associated with current year changes in equity-based compensation; (ii) increases in employee health care costs; (iii) salary and wage increases attributable to annual merit raises; (iv) increased sales and marketing costs attributed to a national advertising campaign and consulting fees related to our pricing initiatives; and (v) costs at Corporate associated with our July 2005 restructuring charge and organizational changes, which were partially offset by associated savings at Corporate. Higher professional fees contributed to the increase in 2004 expenses as compared with 2003. 41 Table of Contents Other Components of Income Before Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles The following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2005 Period Change 2004 Period Change 2003 Interest expense, net $ 465 $ 80 20.8 % $ 385 $ (42 ) 9.8 % $ 427 Equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities 107 9 9.2 98 102 * (4 ) Minority interest 48 12 * 36 30 * 6 Other, net (2 ) (4 ) * 2 14 * (12 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (90 ) (337 ) * 247 (157 ) * 404 * Percentage change not meaningful. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. Interest Expense, net Net interest expense increased by $80 million from 2004 to 2005 due to a $41 million increase in interest expense and a $39 million decline in interest income. The increase in interest expense in 2005 is generally related to a decline in the benefit of our interest rate swaps. For all periods, we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts, which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in net interest expense reductions of $39 million for 2005, $90 million for 2004 and $96 million for 2003. The significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our interest rate swap agreements in 2005 is largely attributable to the increase in short-term market interest rates. Our periodic interest obligations under our interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR, which has increased from 2.56% at December 31, 2004 to 4.54% at December 31, 2005. Included in the $39 million in net reductions to interest expense realized in 2005 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is $42 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $41 million in 2006, $37 million in 2007 and $33 million in 2008. The current year decrease in interest income is due primarily to interest income of $46 million realized during 2004 on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. The comparability of net interest expense for 2004 and 2003 was also significantly affected by this increase in interest income in 2004. Equity in Losses (Earnings) of Unconsolidated Entities In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. Our equity interest in these facilities drives our equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities. The year-over-year increase in these losses is due to the timing of our initial investments in 2004. These equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for Income Taxes. If, for any reason, the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, we could unwind the related investment in the period that determination is made and not incur these equity losses in future periods. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority Interest On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two special purpose type variable interest entities as a result of our implementation of FIN 46. Our minority interest expense for 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the 42 Table of Contents other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities. The increase in minority interest expense as a result of the consolidation of these entities has been more than offset by related increases in our consolidated income from operations. The increase in minority interest expense in 2005 when compared with 2004 was largely due to the improved operating results of the surety bonding company that we began consolidating in 2003. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other, net Our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $90 million in 2005 compared to a provision for income taxes of $247 million for 2004 and $404 million for 2003. For both 2005 and 2004, the effective income tax rates of (8.2)% and 21.0%, respectively, are significantly less than the 2003 effective income tax rate of 36.0% partially due to the resolution of significant tax audits within those years. The settlement of tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $398 million in 2005, $101 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. Excluding the impact of tax audit settlements, the effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 would be 28.2% and 29.5%. For 2005 and 2004, the decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate from 2003 is also attributable to our investments in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities that we obtained in the first half of 2004. The decrease in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in these coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities of $145 million in 2005 and $131 million in 2004 more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities. These tax credits, as well as our non-conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills, are available through 2007 pursuant to Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, but may be phased out if the price of oil exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the IRS. For all periods, a portion of the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes is due to state and local income taxes. In 2005, we reduced our estimated effective state tax rate, causing us to realize a benefit of $16 million related to the reduction of accumulated deferred taxes that was offset in part by additional income tax expense of $4 million to increase the accrued deferred tax as a result of a change in the provincial tax rate in Quebec. In 2005, our overall tax benefit has been partially offset by the accrual of $34 million of taxes associated with our repatriation of $496 million of accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which is discussed further within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of $8 million, net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles” as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by FIN 46. See Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively, to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles” for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below. • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.” 43 Table of Contents • Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as incurred. We recorded $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.” • In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded $101 million, including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a charge to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.” Substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs. • In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.” For a discussion of these variable interest entities see Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources General As an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations. However, we operate in a capital-intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: • the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; • our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; • our liquidity profile; • our asset base; and • our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; and (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills. We are also committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. We also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) became law. A provision of the Act allowed U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings. For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Summary of Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, short-term investments available for use, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 (in millions): 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 666 $ 424 Short-term investments available for use 300 19 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments available for use $ 966 $ 443 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 185 $ 333 Closure, post-closure and remediation funds 205 213 Debt service funds 52 83 Other 18 18 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 460 $ 647 Debt: Current portion $ 522 $ 384 Long-term portion 8,165 8,182 Total debt $ 8,687 $ 8,566 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 47 $ 135 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. For discussion regarding the December 31, 2004 reclassification of cash, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information section above. Short-term investments available for use — These investments include auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment in these securities, they have been classified as current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection with landfill closure, post-closure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 45 Table of Contents Debt Revolving credit and letter of credit facilities — The table below summarizes the credit capacity, maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, principal letter of credit facilities and other credit arrangements as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Outstanding Total Credit Letters of Facility Capacity Maturity Credit Five-year revolving credit facility(a) $ 2,400 October 2009 $ 1,459 Five-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 15 June 2008 15 Five-year letter of credit facility(b) 350 December 2008 328 Seven-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 175 June 2010 175 Ten-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 105 June 2013 105 Other(c) — Various 69 Total $ 3,045 $ 2,151 (a) This facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and we had unused and available credit capacity of $941 million. (b) These facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility. Through December 31, 2005 we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit. (c) We have letters of credit outstanding under various arrangements that do not provide for a committed capacity. Accordingly, the total credit capacity of these arrangements has been noted as zero. We have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain tax-exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste management contracts, closure and post-closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit. We expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future, and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs. Canadian Credit Facility — In November 2005, Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility agreement. The agreement was entered into to facilitate WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its Canadian subsidiaries as discussed above. The agreement, which matures November 30, 2008, allowed Waste Management of Canada Corporation to borrow up to Canadian $410 million at any time on or before December 31, 2005. Any unused portion of the available credit was subject to immediate cancellation. As of December 31, 2005, the entire credit capacity of the facility had been advanced resulting in proceeds of U.S. $339 million. The advances do not accrue interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we received were for the principal amount of U.S. $353 million net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the advance. The advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.39% and mature either three months or twelve months from the date of issuance. However, the terms of the credit facility allow Waste Management of Canada Corporation to elect to renew the advances. As of December 31, 2005, we expect to repay U.S. $86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility. Accordingly, $86 million of debt associated with these borrowings is classified as current in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings have been classified as long-term. Senior notes — As of December 31, 2005, we had $5.2 billion of outstanding senior notes. The notes have various maturities ranging from October 2006 to May 2032, and interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 8.75%. On May 15, 2005, $100 million of 7.0% senior notes and $3 million of 6.65% senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand. We have $300 million of 7.0% senior notes that mature in October 2006 that we currently expect to repay with available cash. 46 Table of Contents Tax-exempt bonds — We actively issue tax-exempt bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had $2.3 billion of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. We issued $246 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2005. The proceeds from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services. Accordingly, the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in “New borrowings” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. As we spend monies on the specific projects being financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds. As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above, we have $185 million held in trust for future spending as of December 31, 2005. During 2005, we received $404 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, $615 million of our tax-exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. Accordingly, these obligations have been classified as long-term in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, we have $333 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation. However, these bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The classification of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use our five-year revolving credit facility. Tax-exempt project bonds — As of December 31, 2005, we had $404 million of outstanding tax-exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of waste-to-energy facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments. As of December 31 2005, $46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. Repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five-year revolving credit facility. Accordingly, these obligations have been classified as long-term in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately $51 million of our tax-exempt project bonds will be repaid with available cash within the next twelve months. Convertible subordinated notes — We had $35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid, with cash on hand, upon maturity on January 24, 2005. Interest rate swaps — We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2005, the interest payments on $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately 65% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 35% at variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by $47 million as of December 31, 2005 and $135 million at December 31, 2004. 47 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,391 $ 2,218 $ 1,926 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,062 ) $ (882 ) $ (1,084 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,090 ) $ (1,130 ) $ (986 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — We generated $2,391 million in cash flows from our operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with $2,218 million in 2004, an increase of $173 million. In general, our current year operating cash flow was favorably affected by growth in our operating income and comparative changes in our trade and other receivables. As of December 31, 2005, our trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, have increased $40 million from December 31, 2004 compared with a $223 million increase in trade receivables during 2004. The increase in our receivables in both periods was primarily related to increased revenues, however, the significant change year-over-year can partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane related services provided in the second half of 2004. The relative change in our receivables can also be attributed to overall improvements in our collection efforts, which have contributed to a reduction in our days sales outstanding. Our 2005 and 2004 income taxes have been significantly affected by tax audit settlements. The increases in our net income associated with these tax benefits resulted in offsetting reductions in our accrued liability balances. Therefore, the significant variances in our income taxes during 2005, 2004 and 2003 have had an insignificant impact on each respective period’s cash flows from operations. Cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a $223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit, which was agreed to in 2001. This amount included: (i) a final net cash settlement payment, net of insurance proceeds of $377 million plus accrued interest; (ii) a total tax benefit of approximately $138 million and (iii) related net settlement recoveries of approximately $16 million. This net cash outflow was partially offset by $109 million of cash we received from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities. After adjusting 2003 for the unusual items mentioned above, our 2004 cash flows from operations increased $178 million over 2003. Our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships were the primary contributors of this increase. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — We used $1,062 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2005, an increase of $180 million as compared with 2004. This increase is primarily due to a $266 million change in net cash flows associated with purchases and sales of short-term investments. Net purchases of short-term investments during 2005 were $295 million compared with net purchases of $29 million during 2004. We increased our utilization of short-term investments in the first quarter of 2004, which resulted in this activity being relatively insignificant in 2003. The increase in our short-term investments available for use as of December 31, 2005 can generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash, which we plan to use to fund, among other things, a $275 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that became effective in January 2006 and our first quarter 2006 dividend that will be paid in March 2006. Our share repurchases and dividends are discussed in our Net Cash Used in Financing Activities section below. The current year increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a result of our short-term investments was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets, which were $194 million in 2005, $96 million in 2004 and $74 million in 2003. The $98 million increase from 2004 to 2005 is largely attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada, as required by a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Tribunal. As we continue to focus on our plan to divest of 48 Table of Contents certain under-performing and non-strategic operations, we expect proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales to make even greater contributions to our cash flows. Our cash used for capital expenditures and acquisition spending has also caused significant changes in our net cash used for investing activities for the three-year period. Due to the capital-intensive nature of our business, we have invested between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in property and equipment during each of the last three years. Capital expenditures for 2005 were $1,180 million, which is $78 million and $20 million less than we invested in capital in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $142 million in 2005, $130 million in 2004 and $337 million in 2003. In recent years, our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck-in acquisitions, which are relatively small, accretive businesses that will easily integrate with, and provide value to, our existing operations. However, our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuck-in acquisitions, particularly in our recycling line-of-business. Our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets, which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the three years ended December 31, 2005 are related to (i) variances in our net debt repayments, which can generally be attributed to scheduled maturities; (ii) increases in our dividend payments; and (iii) changes in cash paid for our repurchases of common stock. Cash paid for these financing activities are discussed below. Net debt repayments were $11 million in 2005, $386 million in 2004 and $456 million in 2003. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year: • 2005 — We received $365 million for new borrowings during the year, primarily related to our Canadian Credit Facility that was entered into to facilitate WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its Canadian subsidiaries. The terms of these borrowings are discussed above. We also repaid $376 million of debt, including $103 million of senior notes, $46 million of tax-exempt project bonds, $35 million of convertible subordinated notes and $192 million associated with capital leases and other debt. • 2004 — We received proceeds of approximately $346 million from the March 2004 issuance of $350 million of 5.0% senior notes, repaid $150 million of 8.0% senior notes that matured in April 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes that matured in May 2004 and $295 million of 7.0% senior notes that matured in October 2004. In addition, we borrowed $69 million, which was primarily for a short-term note that was repaid in 2005, and repaid $25 million of tax-exempt bonds and $42 million of tax-exempt project bonds and made $89 million of payments for capital leases and other debt. • 2003 — Our borrowings were primarily related to tax-exempt bonds and other debt. We repaid $435 million of 6.375% senior notes that matured in December 2003, $43 million of tax-exempt project bonds and $85 million of capital lease obligations and other debt. In August 2003, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend program, which began in the first quarter of 2004. Under this program, we declared and paid a dividend of $0.20 per share in each quarter of 2005 and of $0.1875 per share in each quarter of 2004. The payment of our quarterly dividends resulted in cash dividends of $449 million in 2005 and $432 million in 2004. Before this program was implemented, we paid an annual $0.01 per share dividend, which resulted in a $6 million dividend payment in 2003. In October 2005, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.22 per share. On December 15, 2005, the Board declared our first quarterly dividend for 2006 of $0.22 per share, which will be paid on March 24, 2006 to stockholders of record as of March 6, 2006. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. We paid $706 million for share repurchases in 2005 as compared with $496 million paid during 2004 and $550 million paid in 2003. Our 2005 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a Board approved capital allocation program providing for the authorization of up to $1.2 billion for these activities 49 Table of Contents during each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Since the inception of our repurchase program in February 2002, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately $2.7 billion. We currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above, and in January 2006 repurchased approximately 9 million shares for $275 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 114 $ 112 $ 92 $ 90 $ 92 $ 1,387 $ 1,887 Environmental remediation 47 39 24 16 14 202 342 161 151 116 106 106 1,589 2,229 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 806 533 541 685 716 5,382 8,663 Cash dividend payment(e) 122 — — — — — 122 Unrecorded Obligations:(f) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 75 68 55 47 39 225 509 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(g) 466 161 143 142 62 396 1,370 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2005 $ 1,630 $ 913 $ 855 $ 980 $ 923 $ 7,592 $ 12,893 a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2005 include $333 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation. However, these bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The classification of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use our $2.4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. c) We have classified approximately $290 million of our debt obligations with contractual maturities on or before December 31, 2006 as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 because we have the intent and ability to refinance these obligations with long-term debt instruments. d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, $52 million of our future debt payments and related interest obligations will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as “Other assets” within our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. e) On December 15, 2005, we declared our first quarterly cash dividend for 2006. The dividend is $0.22 per share and is payable March 24, 2006 to stockholders of record on March 6, 2006. Based on shares outstanding on December 31, 2005, the dividend declaration will result in a payment of $122 million. Our dividend declarations are under a Board of Directors approved capital allocation program that provides for up to $1.2 billion for stock repurchases and dividend payments in 2005, 2006 and 2007. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other relevant factors. f) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. g) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 50 Table of Contents We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these contingencies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2005 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including significant start-up costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions may actually result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Through December 31, 2005, we accounted for equity-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended. Under APB No. 25, companies were required to recognize compensation expense based on the “intrinsic value” of the award at the date of grant. For stock options, which were the primary form of awards we granted through December 31, 2004, this meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection with the grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense based on the “fair value” of share based payments on the date of grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, which is discussed further in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans, effective December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of pre-tax compensation charges that would have been recognized over the next three years as the stock options continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the acceleration, but will not be required to recognize future compensation 51 Table of Contents expense for the accelerated options under SFAS No. 123(R) unless further modifications are made to the options, which is not anticipated. Additionally, as a result of the changes in accounting under SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance, our Board of Directors approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we grant. Beginning in 2005, annual stock options grants, as well as stock option grants in connection with new hires and promotions, were replaced with either (i) grants of restricted stock units and performance share units or (ii) an enhanced cash incentive compensation award. The restricted stock units granted in 2005 vest over four years and the performance share units cliff vest based on the achievement of certain performance targets after a three-year performance period. Using APB No. 25, we generally have recognized compensation expense for these awards over their respective vesting periods. Compensation expense included in reported net income associated with restricted stock (shares of which were granted to a limited number of employees in each of the last three years), restricted stock units and performance share units was $17 million, or $11 million net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been significantly different had we accounted for them under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). As a result of our Board of Directors’ decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding options and replace stock options with restricted stock units and performance share units, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to significantly affect our accounting for equity-based compensation since the resulting compensation expense for our new share based payment awards is not significantly different than under APB No. 25. However, we do expect compensation expense to increase over the next three to four years because of the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as our Board of Directors grants additional awards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2005, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $480 million at December 31, 2005 and $490 million at December 31, 2004. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have $460 million and $647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and remedial activities at our disposal 52 Table of Contents facilities and are, therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. At December 31, 2005 and 2004 we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled products such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings, as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy, which governs the type of instruments that may be used. The fair value position of our commodity derivatives would decrease by approximately $10 million at December 31, 2005 and by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2004 if there were an instantaneous 10% increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 53 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:56.626757
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2008. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview In 2008, we saw significant changes in the environment in which we operate, including severe economic uncertainty, increasing market volatility and continued tightening of credit markets, as well as a merger of two of the largest industry competitors. The market conditions in 2008 contributed to record high fuel and commodity prices during most of the year and nearly unprecedented drops in these commodity prices in the second half of the year. We often note that we are a recession resilient industry, but in challenging economic times, reduced consumer and business spending means less waste is being produced. Additionally, businesses across the country are experiencing slower demands for their products and services and a tightening of the credit markets, which makes it more difficult for many of our customers to pay their bills, leading to decreases in the services they request and, in some cases, cancelling our services all together. Against this backdrop, we believe that our results of operations show just how successful we have been in improving our business. The highlights in 2008 include: • An increase in revenues of $78 million in 2008 as compared with the prior year, driven by internal revenue growth on base business due to yield of 2.8%; • Income from operations as a percentage of revenue of 16.7% in 2008 as compared with 16.9% in 2007, in spite of: • the dislocation in the recycling commodities markets experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008; • sharply higher fuel costs throughout most of 2008; and • higher operating expenses in the current year for non-recurring items, including (i) a $33 million non-cash charge for an increase in the estimated present value of recorded obligations for environmental remediation liabilities due to a sharp decline in risk-free interest rates at year-end; and (ii) $50 million of costs associated with labor related matters, which were primarily for the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension funds, compared with $33 million of costs incurred for labor disruptions in 2007; • Strong and consistent diluted earnings per share, which was $2.19 in 2008 compared with $2.23 in 2007; and • An increase in cash flow generated from operating activities of 5.6%, from $2,439 million in 2007 to $2,575 million in 2008. We experienced revenue increases during each of the first three quarters of 2008 as compared with 2007, followed by a significant decline in revenues in the fourth quarter caused primarily by the effect of the recycling commodities markets and the decrease in revenues from our fuel surcharge program. Our pricing program, which focuses on ensuring that we receive appropriate pricing for all of our services, continued to provide significant increases in our revenues from base business yield during 2008, reflecting our commitment to pricing discipline 21 Table of Contents despite the economic environment. We are committed to our pricing excellence program, and do not intend to take volumes at prices that do not cover our costs and provide strong operating margins. Our operating costs increased by $64 million, or less than one percent, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The largest contributors to the increase were the result of conditions discussed above. The negative effect of these cost increases was offset, in part, by benefits from our focus on operating efficiencies, managing fixed costs and reducing variable costs as our volumes decline due to (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing program; and (iii) divestitures. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $45 million, or 3.1%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase is largely attributable to increased labor costs as a result of merit increases, headcount increases, higher compensation costs associated with our equity-based compensation program for our senior employees, and higher insurance and benefit costs. We have also seen an increase in bad debt expense as a result of the weakened economy. Finally, we have incurred significant costs for our business development initiatives, which are focused on gaining new customers and entering new lines of business that are complementary to our core operations. These are costs that we believe are necessary to position Waste Management as a leading environmental solutions provider. As is our practice, we are including free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We also believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in millions), which may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,575 $ 2,439 Capital expenditures (1,221 ) (1,211 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets 112 278 Free cash flow $ 1,466 $ 1,506 Our free cash flow in 2008 exceeded the $1.4 billion we targeted for the year, which we believe is indicative of our continued ability to generate strong cash flow from our operations even in a challenging economic environment. The decrease in our free cash flow when comparing 2008 with 2007 is due to decreased proceeds from divestitures, which is largely a result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as part of our fix-or-seek-exit initiative, offset in large part by growth in our net cash provided by operating activities. Outlook In 2008, we experienced challenges associated with changing market conditions, which caused significant volatility in fuel and recyclable commodity prices, and the tightening of the economy, which has put negative pressure on both consumer and business spending, resulting in less consumption and waste produced. However, we are encouraged that our 2008 results demonstrate that the cornerstones of our business are resilient in a difficult economic environment. We believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn. In 2009, we will focus on (i) ensuring that we are operating efficiently; and (ii) generating strong and consistent free cash flow. In February 2009, we announced that we are taking steps to further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the 45 separate Market Areas that we previously operated have been consolidated into 25 Areas. We currently estimate that this restructuring will eliminate over 22 Table of Contents 1,000 employee positions throughout the Company and result in a restructuring charge of between $40 million and $50 million. We expect to recognize most of this charge during the first quarter of 2009. This realignment is the next step in our efforts to lower costs and further standardize processes and improve productivity, and we currently estimate that it will provide annualized cost savings in excess of $100 million. Although we expect that our net cash provided by operating activities may be negatively affected by general economic conditions, we believe that we will continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, which, along with our available cash, will provide sufficient liquidity to allow us to return value to our shareholders. Our 2009 capital allocation program provides for up to $1.3 billion in aggregate dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reductions. In 2009, we have significant debt repayment obligations, and while we currently intend to refinance a significant portion of the required repayments on a long-term basis, it is possible that we may not have access to the credit markets on acceptable terms. If the credit markets are not available to us, or are not available on terms we deem acceptable, we expect to rely on our available cash, our existing credit facility and the cash we generate from our operations to meet our debt repayment and other obligations. Our discretionary spending includes acquisitions of assets and businesses, dividends, repurchases of our common stock and certain capital expenditures. To the extent operating cash flows decline or are needed to support our debt repayment obligations, we have the ability to reduce our discretionary spending and still deliver superior service to our customers and a strong financial performance for our stockholders. Over the years, the recyclables that we process have been subject to significant market price fluctuations, and in the first three quarters of 2008, increases in the prices of recycling commodities contributed to our revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings. However, our fourth quarter 2008 operating results reflect the significant dislocation in the commodities markets, including substantial reductions in demand both domestically and internationally. In this environment, we have experienced sharp declines in commodity prices and a degree of difficulty in selling recyclable commodities, including at contractually defined prices. We currently expect this market downturn to reduce our revenues and negatively affect our earnings and operating cash flows in 2009. Further, a sustained period of depressed commodity prices and/or demand for recyclables could result in a significant decline in the estimated fair value of WMRA, which could require us to record a non-cash impairment charge to their goodwill. As discussed in our Overview, the cost of fuel also fell significantly in the second half of 2008. We do not expect future volatility in fuel prices to significantly affect our income from operations. However, we do expect the sharp decline in fuel prices to significantly reduce (i) the revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program; and (ii) our direct and indirect fuel costs in 2009 as compared with 2008. Technology Update — On March 20, 2008, we filed a lawsuit in state court in the Southern District of Texas against SAP AG and SAP America, Inc., alleging fraud and breach of contract. The lawsuit relates to our 2005 software license from SAP for a waste and recycling revenue management system and agreement for SAP to implement the software on a fixed-fee basis. We have been assigned a trial date in October 2009. As we continue to assess the alternatives available to us, we may determine that the best course of action is to abandon the SAP revenue management system, which would result in an impairment charge of between $45 million and $55 million. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information Accounting Changes — Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 during the first quarter of 2008 resulted in the recognition of a $6 million charge to operating expenses and a corresponding $3 million credit to minority interest expense for the re-measurement of the fair value of environmental remediation recovery assets accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position No. 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 17 for information about our fair value measurements. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and FSP No. 48-1. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the de-recognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties. FSP No. 48-1 provides guidance associated 23 Table of Contents with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position. Reclassification of Segment Information — During the second quarter of 2008, we moved certain Canadian business operations from the Western Group to the Midwest Group to facilitate improved business execution. We have reflected the impact of this change for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills — The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. 24 Table of Contents Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 42 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2008, 19 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Ten of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining nine landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one- or five-year requirements, as a result of state-specific permitting procedures. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent 25 Table of Contents multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, 26 Table of Contents and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset; (ii) actual third-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each Group to its carrying value, including goodwill. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant judgments and estimates about the future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired. Self-insurance reserves and recoveries — We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues in 2008 were $13.4 billion, compared with $13.3 billion in 2007 and $13.4 billion in 2006. We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Eastern $ 3,182 $ 3,281 $ 3,614 Midwest 3,117 3,141 3,141 Southern 3,667 3,681 3,759 Western 3,300 3,350 3,373 Wheelabrator 912 868 902 WMRA 1,014 953 740 Other 330 307 283 Intercompany (2,134 ) (2,271 ) (2,449 ) Total $ 13,388 $ 13,310 $ 13,363 27 Table of Contents Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling services. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our WMRA Group as well as recycling operations embedded in the operations of our four geographic operating Groups, generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel. Our “other” revenues include our in-plant services, methane gas recovery, Port-O-Let® services, street and parking lot sweeping services, portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Collection $ 8,679 $ 8,714 $ 8,837 Landfill 2,955 3,047 3,197 Transfer 1,589 1,654 1,802 Wheelabrator 912 868 902 Recycling 1,180 1,135 905 Other 207 163 169 Intercompany (2,134 ) (2,271 ) (2,449 ) Total $ 13,388 $ 13,310 $ 13,363 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) and includes internal revenue growth calculated as a percentage of revenues from related business and as a percentage of total Company revenues: Period-to-Period Change Period-to-Period Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 As a% of As a% of As a% of As a% of Related Total Related Total Amount Business(a) Company(b) Amount Business(a) Company(b) Average yield: Solid waste $ 347 3.2 % 2.6 % $ 431 4.0 % 3.3 % Waste-to-energy 19 2.7 0.2 1 0.1 — Base business 366 3.2 2.8 432 3.7 3.3 Commodity 81 6.9 0.6 306 34.3 2.3 Electricity (IPPs) 8 10.8 0.1 2 2.7 — Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 189 36.5 1.4 35 7.3 0.3 Total 644 4.9 4.9 775 5.9 5.9 Volume (557 ) (4.2 ) (588 ) (4.5 ) Internal revenue growth 87 0.7 187 1.4 Acquisition 117 0.9 37 0.3 Divestitures (130 ) (1.0 ) (320 ) (2.4 ) Foreign currency translation 4 — 43 0.3 $ 78 0.6 % $ (53 ) (0.4 )% 28 Table of Contents (a) These percentages are calculated by dividing the amount of the current year increase by the prior year’s related business revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of current year divestitures ($130 million and $320 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively). The table below summarizes the related business revenues for each year, which were used to calculate the percentages of related business: Denominator 2008 2007 Related business revenues: Solid waste $ 10,715 $ 10,877 Waste-to-energy 693 716 Base business 11,408 11,593 Commodity 1,180 893 Electricity (IPPs) 74 75 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 518 482 Total Company $ 13,180 $ 13,043 (b) These percentages are calculated by dividing the amount of the current year increase or decrease by the prior year’s total company revenue ($13,310 million and $13,363 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively) adjusted to exclude the impacts of current year divestitures ($130 million and $320 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively). Base Business — Yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, disposal and waste-to-energy operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. In both 2008 and 2007, our pricing excellence initiative was the primary contributor to our revenue growth from base business yield. Although our pricing programs are contributing to yield improvements in each of our core solid waste lines of business, the increase in revenue from base business yield has been driven by our collection operations in each reported period. Increased collection revenues due to yield were more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes. However, we continue to find that, in spite of collection volume declines, increased yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs provide notable margin improvements and earnings expansion in our collection line of business. Throughout 2008 and 2007, we also experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business from our pricing excellence initiative at our transfer stations and the municipal solid waste streams at our landfills. The increases in transfer station revenues have been the most significant in the Eastern portion of the United States. At our landfills, municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield has been the most significant in our Southern Group, although the Midwest and Western Groups also provided notable revenue growth from yield in this line of business. In 2007, we also experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business in the special waste and construction and demolition waste streams at our landfills. In addition to the revenue growth provided by our pricing initiative, we saw an increase in revenue from yield at our waste-to-energy facilities in 2008. This increase was largely due to annual rate increases for electricity under long-term contracts and favorable energy market pricing, which is generally indexed to natural gas prices. Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base business yield, were $181 million, $121 million and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Commodity — For the first nine months of 2008, revenues increased $178 million due to higher recycling prices as compared with the prior year period. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, a rapid decline in commodity prices due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and 29 Table of Contents internationally caused a year-over-year revenue decrease of $97 million. In 2008, average prices for old corrugated cardboard decreased 9% and average prices for old newsprint increased by 14%. However, when comparing commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the comparable prior year period, average prices for old corrugated cardboard decreased by 58% and average prices for old newsprint decreased by 30%. In 2007, average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased by 62% and average prices for old newsprint increased by 39% when compared with 2006, which drove the $306 million of revenue growth from commodity yield in 2007. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $189 million in 2008. This increase is due to our continued effort to pass on our higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. Although our fuel surcharge program is designed to respond to changes in the market price for fuel, there is an administrative delay between the time our fuel costs change and when we are able to make the corresponding change in our fuel surcharges. This delay negatively affected our ability to fully recover our cost increases in the first six months of 2008 as the increases in our fuel surcharges consistently lagged the sharp increases in fuel costs throughout the first half of the year. However, the cost of fuel began to decline during the third quarter of 2008, allowing us to fully recover the fuel cost increases we incurred during the year. Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $29 million in 2007. Market prices for fuel were relatively flat for the first nine months of 2007, but increased sharply during the fourth quarter. Accordingly, all of the revenue increase due to fuel surcharges in 2007 was generated during the fourth quarter, and we were unable to fully recover our higher fuel costs for the period. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — The decline in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2008 with 2007 has been driven by declines in our collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer station, recycling and third-party disposal volumes. Decreases in 2008 revenue due to lower volumes are discussed in more detail below: Our revenues from collection volumes continue to be affected by our focus on improving margins through increased pricing. However, the slowdown in the economy has also had a significant impact on our industrial collection line of business as a result of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial construction activities across the United States. While our commercial collection line of business tends to be relatively recession resistant, we have experienced some volume declines in this business that we attribute to the sluggish economy. Declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations have been the most notable in our Eastern and Southern Groups and can generally be attributed to the effects of pricing and sluggish economic conditions. The declines in our revenues due to lower volumes in our recycling operations are attributable to the drastic decline in the demand for recyclables in late 2008, both domestically and internationally. We have experienced declines in third-party revenue at our landfills due to reduced construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes throughout 2008, although the volume decline in our construction and demolition waste stream was at a slower rate than it had been in 2007 largely as a result of hurricane-related volume increases in our Southern Group. These volume declines have been offset, in part, by an increase in special waste disposal volumes, primarily in our Southern Group. The decline in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2007 with 2006 was driven by declines in our collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer station and third-party disposal volumes. Decreases in 2007 revenue due to lower volumes are discussed in more detail below: Collection volume declines significantly affected the revenues of each of our collection lines of business in each geographic operating Group, but they were the most significant in our industrial collection business due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the United States. 30 Table of Contents In 2007, declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations were the most notable in our Eastern Group and were generally due to the effects of pricing. We also experienced declines in third-party revenue at our landfills due to reduced disposal volumes. The most significant declines were in our construction and demolition waste, particularly in our Southern Group. The reduction in construction and demolition volumes was largely due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the United States. The volume declines for our municipal solid waste disposal operations were the most significant in our Midwest Group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases. Waste-to-energy and recycling revenues also declined in 2007 due to volume decreases. In our waste-to-energy business, the decrease was largely due to the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May 2007. The revenue decline due to lower third-party volumes in our recycling business was primarily attributable to the decreases in certain brokerage activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility. Acquisitions and Divestitures — Revenues increased $117 million in 2008 and $37 million in 2007 due to acquisitions, principally in the collection, transfer and recycling businesses, although we also made acquisitions in 2008 in our “Other” business as we focus on entering new lines of business. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of $130 million in 2008 and $320 million in 2007. These divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and, to a lesser extent, transfer station and recycling operations. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded revenue declines from divestitures, a trend we had not seen in over two years. This change reflects (i) that there are less under-performing operations that are being considered for divestiture and (ii) the resulting shift of focus to accretive acquisitions. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are driven by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on asset retirement and environmental remediation obligations, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2008 Period Change 2007 Period Change 2006 Labor and related benefits $ 2,420 $ 8 0.3 % $ 2,412 $ (67 ) (2.7 )% $ 2,479 Transfer and disposal costs 1,048 (100 ) (8.7 ) 1,148 (100 ) (8.0 ) 1,248 Maintenance and repairs 1,074 (5 ) (0.5 ) 1,079 (58 ) (5.1 ) 1,137 Subcontractor costs 901 (1 ) (0.1 ) 902 (69 ) (7.1 ) 971 Cost of goods sold 812 43 5.6 769 180 30.6 589 Fuel 715 134 23.1 581 2 0.3 579 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 608 6 1.0 602 (39 ) (6.1 ) 641 Landfill operating costs 291 30 11.5 261 23 9.7 238 Risk management 209 (8 ) (3.7 ) 217 (74 ) (25.4 ) 291 Other 388 (43 ) (10.0 ) 431 17 4.1 414 $ 8,466 $ 64 0.8 % $ 8,402 $ (185 ) (2.2 )% $ 8,587 The changes in our operating expenses for 2008 and 2007 compared with the prior years can largely be attributed to the following: • Volume declines and divestitures — In both 2008 and 2007, we experienced volume declines as a result of (i) the weakening economy; (ii) our focus on our pricing program and shedding unprofitable business; and (iii) divestitures. We continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines, and have achieved significant cost savings as a result. These cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table above. • Acquisitions and growth initiatives — During 2008, a significant portion of the cost savings derived from divestitures was offset by cost increases attributed to recently acquired businesses and, to a lesser extent, other growth initiatives. • Fuel price increases — In each year, increased fuel costs have increased our operating expenses and negatively affected our operating margins. Diesel fuel prices varied significantly in 2008, reaching a record-high price of $4.76 per gallon in July and falling to a three-year low of $2.33 per gallon by the end of the year. On average, diesel fuel prices increased 32% from $2.88 per gallon in 2007 to $3.81 per gallon in 2008. For 2007, we experienced an average increase of $0.18 per gallon as compared with 2006, or almost 7%. Higher fuel costs caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs throughout 2008 and 2007. As disclosed in the Operating Revenues section above, we have a fuel surcharge program that is designed to recover our increased fuel costs. Although our fuel surcharge program is designed to respond to changes in the market price for fuel, there is an administrative delay between the time our fuel costs change and when we are able to make the corresponding change in our fuel surcharges. This delay negatively affected our ability to fully recover our cost increases in the first six months of 2008 as the increases in our fuel surcharges consistently lagged the sharp increases in fuel costs throughout the first half of the year. However, the cost of fuel declined during the last half of 2008, allowing us to fully recover the fuel costs increase we incurred during the year. • Commodities markets — Market prices for recyclable commodities increased significantly from 2006 to 2007 and also continued to climb through most of 2008, resulting in higher costs of goods sold in both periods. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the market prices and demand for recyclable commodities declined sharply. The significant decrease in market prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 and significant decreases in our brokerage and recycling facility volumes during much of 2008 partially offset the effect of higher commodity prices on our cost of goods sold during the first three quarters of 2008. 32 Table of Contents • Union-related labor issues — Our 2008 operating expenses were significantly affected by a labor disruption associated with the renegotiation of a collective bargaining agreement in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the related agreement of the bargaining unit to withdraw from the underfunded Central States Pension Fund, which is discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These activities increased the operating expenses of our Midwest Group by $32 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Approximately $24 million of these costs have been included in the “Labor and related benefits” category, $21 million of which were associated with charges related to the bargaining unit agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from the underfunded Central States Pension Fund. The remaining $8 million has been included in our “Other” category and was related to security and the deployment and lodging costs incurred for the Company’s replacement workers who were brought to Milwaukee from across the organization. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred another $18 million in “Labor and related benefits” charges associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units in our Midwest and Eastern Groups from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. In 2007, our Western Group incurred “Other” operating expenses of $33 million for security, labor, lodging, travel and other costs incurred as a result of labor disruptions in Oakland and Los Angeles, California. • Changes in risk-free interest rates — We recognized a $33 million charge to landfill operating costs during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a sharp decline in United States Treasury rates, which are used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the discount rate used was reduced from 4.00% to 2.25%. During 2007, we recorded an $8 million charge to reduce the discount rate from 4.75% to 4.00% and during 2006 we recorded a $6 million decrease in expense to reflect an increase in the rate from 4.25% to 4.75%. Many of the cost increases summarized above are due to general economic and market conditions over which we have little or no control. After considering the significant impacts of market-driven factors, we are encouraged that our results continue to reflect our focus on (i) identifying operational efficiencies that translate into cost savings; (ii) managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable costs as volumes decline due to our pricing program and the downturn in the economy; and (iii) reducing our costs in light of recent divestitures. Other items affecting the comparability of our operating expenses by category for the three years presented include the following: Labor and related benefits • In each year, wages increased due to annual merit adjustments, although these higher costs have been more than offset by headcount reductions due to operational efficiencies and divestitures. • We experienced additional overtime and other labor costs due to severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2008 in our Midwest Group. • Our accrued bonus expenses were lower in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plans was not as strong as it had been in either 2007 or 2006. Transfer and disposal costs • During 2008 and 2007, these costs decreased due to volume declines and divestitures. • During 2008 and 2007, these costs further decreased due to our focus on improving internalization. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes • The favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group reduced these expenses by $18 million during 2007 and $3 million during 2008. Landfill operating costs • In 2008, these costs included the unfavorable impact of the January 1, 2008 adoption of SFAS No. 157, which resulted in a $6 million charge. 33 Table of Contents • During 2007, we recognized an $8 million charge for a revision in our estimate of remediation costs associated with one of our prior operations. Risk management • Over the last three years, we have been successful in reducing these costs, which can be primarily attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. • For 2008, the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of workers’ compensation costs and reduced auto and general liability claims for current claim periods. • For 2007, the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of auto and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, reduced workers’ compensation costs, all primarily related to prior claim periods. Other • In 2007, we incurred $21 million of lease termination costs associated with the purchase of one of our independent power production plants that had previously been operated through a lease agreement. • In 2008 and 2007, we had an increase in gains recognized on the sales of assets due to our focus on identifying under-utilized assets in order to increase our efficiency. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2008 Period Change 2007 Period Change 2006 Labor and related benefits $ 853 $ 18 2.2 % $ 835 $ 41 5.2 % $ 794 Professional fees 168 8 5.0 160 (1 ) (0.6 ) 161 Provision for bad debts 57 8 16.3 49 — — 49 Other 399 11 2.8 388 4 1.0 384 $ 1,477 $ 45 3.1 % $ 1,432 $ 44 3.2 % $ 1,388 A significant portion of the $45 million increase in our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in 2008 was as a result of our focus on business development initiatives, including gaining new customers and entering new lines of business. We estimate that these initiatives increased our expenses by nearly $19 million when comparing 2008 with 2007. Approximately $8 million of the $19 million increase is associated with increased consulting costs and has been included in “Professional fees.” The remaining cost increases can generally be attributed to increased headcount, advertising and travel and entertainment costs. Other significant changes in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the reported periods are summarized below: Labor and related benefits — The increases in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to (i) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit raises; (ii) higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an increase in the size of our sales force and our focus on our people and business development initiatives; and (iii) higher non-cash compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plans. In 2008, we also experienced higher insurance and benefit costs. These increases were 34 Table of Contents partially offset by lower bonus expenses accrued in 2008 because our performance against targets established by our incentive plan was not as strong as it had been in either 2007 or 2006. Professional fees — We incurred significant costs in both 2008 and 2007 that are of a non-recurring nature. In 2008, we incurred over $7 million of legal and consulting costs to support our previously proposed acquisition of Republic Services, Inc. In 2007, our consulting fees were higher due to increased spending for various strategic initiatives, including the support and development of the SAP waste and recycling revenue management system, which we discontinued development of in early 2008. For information related to the current status of our pending litigation against SAP, refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for bad debts — The increase in our provision for bad debts in 2008 is due to the effects of the weakened economy, which has increased collection risks associated with certain customers. Other — As discussed above, our continued focus on our sales, marketing and other initiatives and identifying new customers resulted in increases in our advertising costs and travel and entertainment costs in 2008. The comparability of these costs for the periods presented has also been affected by net charges of approximately $2 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006 to record our estimated obligations for unclaimed property. Additionally, in both 2007 and 2006, our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2008 Period Change 2007 Period Change 2006 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 785 $ (11 ) (1.4 )% $ 796 $ (33 ) (4.0 )% $ 829 Amortization of landfill airspace 429 (11 ) (2.5 ) 440 (39 ) (8.1 ) 479 Amortization of intangible assets 24 1 4.3 23 (3 ) (11.5 ) 26 $ 1,238 $ (21 ) (1.7 )% $ 1,259 $ (75 ) (5.6 )% $ 1,334 In both 2008 and 2007, the decrease in depreciation on tangible property and equipment is largely due to (i) components of enterprise-wide software becoming fully-depreciated; and (ii) our focus on identifying operational efficiencies as we shed unprofitable business, which has allowed us to retire or sell under-utilized assets. The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2008 and 2007 is largely due to volume declines as a result of (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing program, which has significantly reduced our collection volumes; and (iii) the redirection of waste to third-party disposal facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills where we are working on procuring an expansion permit. The comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $3 million, $17 million and $1 million, respectively, for the effects of these 35 Table of Contents changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs; or (iii) completed final capping construction that cost less than anticipated. Restructuring Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure. As discussed in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2009 we announced that we were taking steps to streamline our organization by consolidating many of our Market Areas and realigning our Corporate support organization. In 2008, we recognized $2 million of restructuring expenses for the reorganization of customer service functions in our Western Group and the realignment of certain operations in our Southern Group. In the first quarter of 2007, we restructured certain operations and functions, resulting in the recognition of a charge of approximately $9 million. We incurred an additional $1 million of costs for this restructuring during the second quarter of 2007, increasing total costs incurred to $10 million. Approximately $7 million of the 2007 restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate organization, $2 million was incurred by our Midwest Group and $1 million was incurred by our Western Group. These charges included approximately $8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and approximately $2 million related to operating lease agreements. The most significant cost savings we have obtained through these restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) $ (33 ) $ (59 ) $ (26 ) Impairments of assets held-for-use 4 12 24 Other — — 27 $ (29 ) $ (47 ) $ 25 (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) — The net gains from divestitures in all three years were a result of our fix-or-seek-exit initiative. In 2008, these gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our Southern Group; in 2007, the gains were related to the divestiture of underperforming collection, transfer and recycling operations in our Eastern, Western, Southern and WMRA Groups; and in 2006, the gains were primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our Western Group. Gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment charges of $18 million, which were principally recognized by our Eastern Group, for business operations held for sale as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Impairments of assets held-for-use — During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two landfills in our Southern Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill. The $24 million of impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of under-performing operations in our WMRA Group. 36 Table of Contents Other — In 2006, we recognized a $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2008 Period Change 2007 Period Change 2006 Operating segments: Eastern $ 501 $ (19 ) (3.7 )% $ 520 $ 131 33.7 % $ 389 Midwest 463 (39 ) (7.8 ) 502 47 10.3 455 Southern 863 47 5.8 816 12 1.5 804 Western 601 (3 ) (0.5 ) 604 (16 ) (2.6 ) 620 Wheelabrator 323 31 10.6 292 (23 ) (7.3 ) 315 WMRA 52 (26 ) (33.3 ) 78 64 * 14 Other (58 ) (18 ) 45.0 (40 ) (17 ) * (23 ) Corporate and other (511 ) 7 (1.4 ) (518 ) 27 (5.0 ) (545 ) Total $ 2,234 $ (20 ) (0.9 )% $ 2,254 $ 225 11.1 % $ 2,029 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Operating segments — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our geographic operating segments during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, are (i) increased revenue from yield on base business as a result of our pricing strategies, particularly in our collection operations; (ii) declines in revenues due to lower volumes, which can be attributed to pricing competition, the significant downturn in construction and the slowdown of the general economy; and (iii) our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies. For the first nine months of 2008, our Groups also experienced an unfavorable effect on operating income of significantly higher fuel costs. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, fuel costs decreased significantly enough to reverse this trend, resulting in an immaterial impact to the full year. See additional discussion in the Operating Revenues section above. Summarized below are the other significant items specific to each operating segment’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Eastern — The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was negatively affected by a $14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. This charge was offset, in part, by a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was favorably affected by (i) net divestiture gains of $33 million; (ii) an $18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter; and (iii) a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by $26 million in impairment charges associated with (i) businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program; and (ii) a change in our expectations for future operations of a landfill. In 2006, the Group also incurred $14 million of strike-related costs incurred primarily in the New York City area. Midwest — The Group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by $44 million of additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Included in the labor dispute expenses is a $32 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain of the Group’s bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension plans. In addition, the Group experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2008. Positively affecting operating results both in 2008 and in 2007 37 Table of Contents were divestiture gains of $4 million in 2008 and $1 million in 2007 and reductions in landfill amortization expense resulting from changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Southern — During 2008, the increase in the Group’s operating income is largely due to $29 million of divestiture gains, offset, in part, by a $3 million landfill impairment charge. During 2007, the Group recorded $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills. These charges were largely offset by gains on divestitures of $11 million. Western — The Group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected by an increase in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. In 2007, labor disputes negatively affected the Group’s operating results by $37 million, principally as a result of “Operating” expenses incurred for security, deployment and lodging costs for replacement workers. Gains on divestitures of operations were $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared with $48 million for 2006. Wheelabrator — The Group’s 2008 operating results were favorably affected by increases in market rates for energy during the second half of 2008. The decline in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by a $21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 for the early termination of a lease agreement. The early termination was due to the Group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement. Additionally, the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May 2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income compared with the prior year. WMRA — During the first nine months of 2008 and throughout all of 2007, the Group’s operating income benefited from substantial increases in market prices for commodities. Also during these periods, the Group experienced income growth due to an increased focus on maintaining or reducing rebates made to suppliers. During the fourth quarter of 2008, however, commodity prices dropped sharply as a result of a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and internationally. This significant decline in commodity prices resulted in operating losses that more than offset the income generated during the first nine months of the year. Higher than normal operating expenses, including higher subcontractor, repair and maintenance, and facility start-up costs, also negatively affected the Group’s operating income throughout 2008. The comparison of the Group’s operating income for the periods presented has also been affected by (i) $7 million of net gains on divestitures in 2007 and (ii) the recognition in 2006 of $10 million of charges for a loss from a divestiture and an impairment of certain under-performing operations, which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the Group’s cost control efforts. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized below: Other — The unfavorable change in operating results in 2008 when compared with 2007 is the result of costs being incurred to support our increased focus on the identification and development of new lines of business that will complement our core business. The unfavorable change in operating results in 2007 when compared with 2006 is largely related to (i) certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed; and (ii) the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in April 2006. Corporate and Other — The decline in expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was primarily due to: • lower bonus expense in 2008; • the recognition of approximately $6 million of restructuring charges during the first quarter of 2007 for employee severance and benefit costs; • reduced risk management costs in 2008, which is attributable to reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for workers’ compensation and auto and general liability claims; and • higher employee healthcare coverage expenses in the third quarter of 2007 due to unusually high claims activity. 38 Table of Contents The expense declines noted above were largely offset by the impacts of the following: • a $32 million charge to landfill operating costs for the closed landfills that are managed by our closed sites management group through our Corporate organization, due to a sharp decline in United States Treasury rates in late 2008, which caused an increase in the present value of our environmental remediation obligations; and • costs incurred for the potential acquisition of Republic during the third quarter of 2008. The decline in expenses when comparing 2007 with 2006 was primarily due to: • significantly lower risk management costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs; • a reduction in expenses from the discontinuation of depreciation for certain enterprise-wide software; and • a $20 million charge recorded in 2006 to recognize unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property. The expense declines noted above were offset, in part, by the impacts of the following: • increased spending on the support and development of our information technology, people and pricing strategic initiatives; • increased labor and related benefits costs; and • restructuring charges recognized during the first quarter of 2007. Other Components of Net Income The following table summarizes the other major components of our income for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2008 Period Change 2007 Period Change 2006 Interest expense $ (455 ) $ 66 (12.7 )% $ (521 ) $ 24 (4.4 )% $ (545 ) Interest income 19 (28 ) (59.6 ) 47 (22 ) (31.9 ) 69 Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities (4 ) 31 * (35 ) 1 (2.8 ) (36 ) Minority interest (41 ) 5 (10.9 ) (46 ) (2 ) 4.5 (44 ) Other, net 3 (1 ) (25.0 ) 4 3 * 1 Provision for income taxes 669 129 * 540 215 * 325 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. Interest Expense Although our outstanding debt balances are relatively consistent year-over-year, the decline in interest costs when comparing 2008 with 2007 is generally related to (i) the maturity of higher rate debt that we have refinanced at lower interest rates; (ii) significant declines in market interest rates, which impact the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps and our variable rate debt; and (iii) the early redemption of $244 million of 8.75% senior notes during the second quarter of 2008, which resulted in the recognition of a reduction in interest expense of approximately $10 million for the immediate recognition of fair value adjustments associated with terminated interest rate swaps that had been deferred and were being amortized over the life of the debt. The decrease in interest expense when comparing 2007 with 2006 is largely related to a decrease in our average debt balances. We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense decrease of $50 million for 2008 and net interest expense increases of $11 million for 2007 and $4 million for 2006. Our active interest rate swaps decreased our interest expense in 2008 by $8 million compared with an increase in interest expense in 2007 from active hedges of $48 million. The significant change in the impact of our active interest rate swaps when comparing 2008 with 2007 has been driven by the decrease in short-term market interest rates, which 39 Table of Contents drive our periodic interest obligations under our active swap agreements. Our periodic interest obligations under these agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR, which was as low as 1.43% in late 2008 and as high as 5.62% in the second half of 2007. In 2008, the year-over-year change in the impact of interest rate swaps is also due to our terminated swaps, which caused a $42 million reduction in interest expense in 2008 compared with a $37 million reduction in interest expense in 2007. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $18 million in 2009, $11 million in 2010, and $5 million in 2011. Interest Income When comparing 2008 with 2007, the decrease in interest income is primarily due to (i) significant declines in market interest rates; (ii) the recognition of $7 million in interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group; and (iii) a decrease in our average cash and investment balances. When comparing 2007 with 2006, the decrease in interest income is primarily due to (i) a decrease in our average cash and investment balances; and (ii) $14 million of interest income realized in 2006 on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities During the reported periods, our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our equity interests in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. The equity losses generated by the facilities were offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for income taxes. Our equity in the losses of these facilities was $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The significant decline in these losses in 2008 as compared with the prior year periods is due to the expiration of our investments at the end of 2007. The comparability of the losses incurred in 2007 and 2006 is primarily affected by (i) the impact of the partial phase-out of Section 45K credits during each year on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses; (ii) the temporary suspension of operations at the facilities in 2006; and (iii) the recognition of a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our life-to-date obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment, which was recognized in 2006. Refer to Note 8 for additional information related to the impact of these investments. Minority Interest On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group as a result of our implementation of FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $669 million in 2008, $540 million in 2007 and $325 million in 2006. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 38.1%, 31.7% and 22.1% for each of the three years, respectively. At current income levels, we expect that our 2009 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 40%. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is primarily affected by (i) increases in our income before taxes; (ii) differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements; and (iii) the impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits, which expired at the end of 2007. The impacts of tax audit settlements and non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are the items that had the most significant impacts on the comparability of our effective tax rate during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, are summarized below: • Tax audit settlements — When excluding the effect of interest income, the settlement of various tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (representing a 1.5 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate), $40 million for the year ended 40 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 (representing a 2.3 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate) and $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 (representing a 10.1 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate). • Non-conventional fuel tax credits — Through December 31, 2007, non-conventional fuel tax credits were derived from our landfills and our investments in the two coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities discussed in the Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities section above. Pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, these tax credits were phased-out if the price of oil exceeded an annual average as determined by the IRS. Based on an estimated phase-out of 69% of Section 45K tax credits generated during 2007, our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $50 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax credits resulted in a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. In April 2008, the IRS published the phase-out percentage that must be applied to Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007, which was 67.2%. Our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2008 included an adjustment of our 2007 year-end estimate to the final 2007 phase-out, which resulted in the recognition of a $3 million benefit. Our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 included $71 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits, resulting in a 4.8 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate. Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007 pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code. Other items that have affected our reported income taxes during the reported periods include the following: • Canadian tax rate changes and the related revaluation of deferred tax balances resulted in a $30 million tax benefit during 2007 compared with a $20 million tax benefit in 2006. We did not have any comparable adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2008. • We recorded reductions to income tax expense of $8 million in 2008, $9 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006 due to state-related tax items. These impacts were generally due to either (i) the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities as a result of a decrease in our effective state tax rate or (ii) the expected utilization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 267 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2008 and we owned or operated 271 solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Remaining cubic yards 4,456 816 5,272 4,265 944 5,209 Remaining tonnage 3,979 794 4,773 3,787 893 4,680 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2008 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 32 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 42 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 41 Table of Contents The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2008, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 11 17 41 65 78 212 Operated through lease(a) 5 4 5 7 6 27 Operating contracts(b) 11 4 10 5 4 34 Total landfills 27 25 56 77 88 273 (a) From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. The property owner is generally responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our operating contracts. The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions): December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance, beginning of year 3,787 893 4,680 3,760 959 4,719 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 20 15 35 (5 ) (15 ) (20 ) Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 94 94 — 60 60 Expansion permits granted(b) 228 (228 ) — 128 (128 ) — Airspace consumed (107 ) — (107 ) (114 ) — (114 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 51 20 71 18 17 35 Balance, end of year 3,979 794 4,773 3,787 893 4,680 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impact of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted; and (iv) decreases due to our decision to no longer pursue an expansion permit. (b) We received expansion permits at 28 of our landfills during 2008 and 17 of our landfills during 2007, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. 42 Table of Contents The tons received at our landfills in 2008 and 2007 are shown below (in thousands): 2008 2007 # of Total Tons # of Total Tons Sites Tons per Day Sites Tons per Day Solid waste landfills 267 (a) 106,731 391 271 113,449 417 Hazardous waste landfills 6 1,384 5 6 1,473 5 273 108,115 396 277 114,922 422 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 9 882 8 1,555 108,997 (b) 116,477 (b) (a) In 2008, we acquired five landfills, closed five landfills and discontinued operations at four landfills. (b) These amounts include 2.0 million tons at December 31, 2008 and 2.4 million tons at December 31, 2007 that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate (i) reaches its permitted waste capacity; (ii) is permanently capped; and (iii) receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, management of the site, including remediation activities, is generally transferred to our closed sites management group. In addition to the 273 active landfills we managed at December 31, 2008, we managed 195 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2008 (in millions): Accumulated Cost Basis of Landfill Airspace Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2007 $ 11,549 $ (5,834 ) $ 5,715 Capital additions 473 — 473 SFAS No. 143 obligations incurred and capitalized 51 — 51 Acquisitions 46 — 46 Landfill airspace amortization expense — (429 ) (429 ) Foreign currency translation (234 ) 61 (173 ) Asset retirements and other adjustments (169 ) 149 (20 ) December 31, 2008 $ 11,716 $ (6,053 ) $ 5,663 As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that we will spend approximately $500 million in 2009, and approximately $1 billion in 2010 and 2011 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. 43 Table of Contents Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and its Interpretations, and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2008 (in millions): Environmental Landfill Remediation December 31, 2007 $ 1,178 $ 284 Obligations incurred and capitalized 51 — Obligations settled (72 ) (38 ) Interest accretion 77 8 Revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions(a) (13 ) 49 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (3 ) (4 ) December 31, 2008 $ 1,218 $ 299 (a) The significant increase in our environmental remediation liabilities for revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions is largely related to the decline in the risk-free discount rate used to estimate the present value of the obligations. The impact of this revision in estimate is discussed further below. Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 77 $ 74 $ 70 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 41 18 3 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 69 58 59 Landfill remediation costs 17 17 6 Other landfill site costs 87 94 100 Total landfill operating costs $ 291 $ 261 $ 238 The increase in these costs in 2008 can largely be attributed to a significant decline in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities, which is based on the rate for United States Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $33 million charge to “Operating” expenses, offset in part by a $6 million reduction in “Minority interest” expense, to reduce the discount rate from 4.00% to 2.25%. We recorded an $8 million charge to “Operating” expenses during the fourth quarter of 2007 to reduce the discount rate from 4.75% to 4.00% and a $6 million decrease in “Operating” expenses during the fourth quarter of 2006 to increase the discount rate from 4.25% to 4.75%. Additionally, in 2008, our leachate collection costs were higher in our Eastern Group and Midwest Group due to increased precipitation and operational changes in these regions. 44 Table of Contents Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific final capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per ton amortization rates. The following table calculates our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Landfill airspace amortization expense (in millions) $ 429 $ 440 $ 479 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 107 114 126 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.01 $ 3.86 $ 3.80 Different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 273 landfills, and per ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to the next due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes received across the Company year-over-year. The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was reduced by $3 million in 2008, $17 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs; or (iii) completed final capping construction that cost less than anticipated. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying debt and discharging other obligations. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. 45 Table of Contents Summary of Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, short-term investments available for use, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (in millions): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 480 $ 348 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 123 $ 117 Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 213 231 Debt service funds 35 47 Other 10 23 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 381 $ 418 Debt: Current portion $ 835 $ 329 Long-term portion 7,491 8,008 Total debt $ 8,326 $ 8,337 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 150 $ 72 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in United States government obligations, all of which have original maturities of three months or less. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of our debt obligations, funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2008 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 can primarily be attributed to (i) net debt repayments of $260 million; (ii) non-cash proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of $169 million; (iii) a $78 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps; and (iv) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our balances due to foreign currency translation, interest and capital leases. We have approximately $1.2 billion of scheduled debt maturities during the next twelve months. We have classified approximately $509 million of these borrowings as long-term as of December 31, 2008 based on our intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. 46 Table of Contents We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31 categorized by facility: 2008 2007 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 1,803 $ 1,437 Letter of credit facility(b) — 350 Letter of credit and term loan agreements(c) 272 294 Other(d) 91 90 $ 2,166 $ 2,171 (a) WMI’s $2.4 billion revolving credit facility matures in August 2011. At December 31, 2008, $1,803 million of letters of credit and $300 million of borrowings were outstanding under the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $297 million. The increase in our utilization of this facility during 2008 is due to the expiration of our $350 million letter of credit facility in December 2008. (b) This $350 million letter of credit facility expired in December 2008, and the letters of credit that had previously been supported by this facility were issued under the revolving credit facility. (c) At December 31, 2008, we have a $175 million letter of credit and term loan agreement that expires in June 2010 and a $105 million letter of credit and term loan agreement that expires in June 2013. At December 31, 2008, no borrowings were outstanding under these agreements, and we had $8 million of unused and available capacity. At December 31, 2007, we also had a $15 million letter of credit and term loan agreement that expired in June 2008. (d) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not provide for a committed credit capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,575 $ 2,439 $ 2,540 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,183 ) $ (761 ) $ (788 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,256 ) $ (1,946 ) $ (1,803 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: • Earnings decline — Our income from operations, net of depreciation and amortization, decreased by $41 million, on a year-over-year basis, which negatively affected our cash flow from operations in 2008. • Receivables — The change in our trade receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, provided a source of cash of approximately $185 million in 2008. In 2008, our receivables balances declined primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved efficiency of collections. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2008, we collected an outstanding receivable related to our investments in the synthetic fuel production facilities that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007. Approximately $60 million of the cash we received represented amounts that we paid to the facilities during 2006 and 2007 for which we did not ultimately realize a tax benefit, and was reflected as an operating cash inflow. • Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $170 million higher on a year-over-year basis, due in large part to an increase in both our taxable income and our effective tax rate. The comparability of our 2008 and 47 Table of Contents 2007 effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. In addition, the overpayment of income taxes in 2006 reduced our 2007 tax payments. • Decreased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $65 million lower on a year-over-year basis. This decline is due primarily to a decline in our weighted average borrowing rate, which can be attributed to the maturity of higher rate debt that we refinanced at lower rates and a decline in market rates. • Accounts payable processes — In 2008, we began various initiatives to improve our working capital management, including reviewing our accounts payable process to ensure vendor payments are made on a basis that results in more optimal cash management. The changes made to the timing of our vendor payments favorably impacted our cash flow from operations on a year-over-year basis by approximately $30 million. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below: • Earnings improvements — Our income from operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by $150 million, on a year-over-year basis, which positively affected our cash flows from operations in 2007. • Decreased income tax payments and refunds — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $80 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely due to excess tax payments in 2006, which reduced our estimated tax payment made in the third quarter of 2007. Cash tax refunds attributable to audit settlements decreased by approximately $40 million on a year-over-year basis. • Risk management assets and liabilities — During 2007, we were able to reduce risk management liabilities by approximately $80 million, primarily as a result of reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for auto and general liability and worker’s compensation claims, which was attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. While this non-cash reserve reduction had a positive impact on income from operations, it did not have a significant impact on our cash flow from operations. • Trade receivables — The change in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, negatively affected the comparison of our cash flows from operations by approximately $70 million. This decline is primarily attributable to increased trade receivables when comparing 2007 and 2006 as compared to decreased trade receivables when comparing 2006 to 2005. • Increased bonus payments — Our bonus payments for 2006, which were paid in the first quarter of 2007, were higher than bonus payments for 2005 paid in 2006 due to the relative strength of our financial performance against incentive plan measures in 2006 as compared with 2005. The comparative changes in our liabilities for bonuses negatively affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $60 million. • Liabilities for unclaimed property — In 2007, we made significant cash payments for our obligations associated with unclaimed property, reducing our liabilities. In 2006, our liabilities for unclaimed property increased, primarily due to the charge to earnings required to fully record our obligations. The changes in our recorded obligations for unclaimed property negatively affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $30 million. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Cash paid for acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions increased from $32 million during 2006 to $90 million during 2007 and $280 million in 2008 due to an increased focus on accretive acquisitions and other investments that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. • Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $112 million in 2008, $278 million in 2007 and $240 million in 2006. Our proceeds from divestitures for all three years have been driven by the divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic operations. The 48 Table of Contents decrease in proceeds from divestitures in 2008 was largely a result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as part of our fix-or-seek-exit initiative. • Capital expenditures — We used $1,221 million during 2008 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,211 million in 2007 and $1,329 million in 2006. Capital expenditures in 2006 were higher than either 2007 or 2008 due to relatively high levels of fleet capital spending done in advance of significant mandated changes in heavy-duty truck engines beginning in January 2007. • Purchases and sales of short-term investments — Net sales of short-term investments provided $184 million of cash in 2007, compared with $122 million during 2006. We used proceeds from the sale of our short-term investments to provide cash that we used to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, which are discussed below. We did not hold any short-term investments during 2008. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $178 million to our investing activities in 2008 compared with $120 million in 2007 and $253 million in 2006. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases and dividend payments — Our 2008, 2007 and 2006 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $410 million for share repurchases in 2008 as compared with $1,421 million in 2007 and $1,072 million in 2006. We repurchased approximately 12 million, 40 million and 31 million shares of our common stock in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The significant decline in share repurchases during 2008 is largely attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in connection with our proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Republic Services, Inc. When the proposal was withdrawn in October 2008, we determined that, given the state of the financial markets, it would be prudent to suspend repurchases for the foreseeable future. We paid an aggregate of $531 million in cash dividends during 2008 compared with $495 million in 2007 and $476 million in 2006. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.22 in 2006, to $0.24 in 2007 and to $0.27 in 2008. The impact of the year-over-year increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program. In December 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new capital allocation program that includes the authorization for up to $1.3 billion in combined cash dividends, common stock repurchases, debt reduction and acquisitions in 2009. At this time, the Board of Directors also announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.29 per share. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. • Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and warrants — The exercise of common stock options and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $44 million of financing cash inflows during 2008 compared with $168 million during 2007 and $340 million in 2006. We believe the relatively large impact of stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 was due to the substantial increase in the market value of our common stock during 2006 and the accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options in December 2005 because the acceleration made additional options available for exercise. 49 Table of Contents • Net debt repayments — Net debt repayments were $260 million in 2008, $256 million in 2007 and $500 million in 2006. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility $ 350 $ 300 $ — Canadian credit facility 581 644 432 Senior notes 594 — — $ 1,525 $ 944 $ 432 Repayments: Revolving credit facility $ (371 ) $ — $ — Canadian credit facility (634 ) (680 ) (479 ) Senior notes (633 ) (300 ) (300 ) Tax exempt bonds (19 ) (52 ) (9 ) Tax exempt project bonds (67 ) (61 ) (50 ) Capital leases and other debt (61 ) (107 ) (94 ) $ (1,785 ) $ (1,200 ) $ (932 ) Net repayments $ (260 ) $ (256 ) $ (500 ) This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and debt repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, these non-cash financing activities were primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings. Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds, were $169 million in 2008, $144 million in 2007 and $157 million in 2006. • Accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances — Changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances are reflected as “Other” financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. There are significant changes in these accrued liability balances as of each year-end, which is generally attributable to the timing of cash deposits. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 108 $ 124 $ 84 $ 84 $ 90 $ 1,776 $ 2,266 Environmental remediation 49 35 24 18 15 152 293 157 159 108 102 105 1,928 2,559 Debt payments(b), (c) 1,184 719 255 583 170 5,277 8,188 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 81 71 58 57 46 272 585 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(e) 103 103 65 53 41 269 634 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2008 $ 1,525 $ 1,052 $ 486 $ 795 $ 362 $ 7,746 $ 11,966 50 Table of Contents (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2008 include $347 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds and $40 million of tax-exempt project bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, $35 million of our future debt payments and related interest obligations will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as long-term “Other assets” within our December 31, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. (d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (e) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. This approach has resulted in a significant decline in our reported contractual obligations associated with our waste paper purchase agreements due to the sharp decline in commodity prices late in 2008. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table will not be indicative of our actual cash flow obligations associated with these contracts should the market prices for the recyclable commodities recover. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies has not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these contingencies. Liquidity Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions As discussed in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2008 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 51 Table of Contents Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes generally experienced by our Southern Group, can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including significant start-up costs, such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our asset retirement obligations, which are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 143. FSP FAS 157-2 establishes January 1, 2009 as the effective date of SFAS No. 157 with respect to these fair value measurements for the Company. We do not currently expect the application of the fair value framework established by SFAS No. 157 to non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we will continue to assess the potential effects of SFAS No. 157 as additional guidance becomes available. SFAS No. 141(R) — Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The portions of the statement that relate to business combinations completed before the effective date will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, our adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result of (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets, liabilities and contingencies at their fair values; and (ii) the requirement that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition. SFAS No. 160 — Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It states that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied 52 Table of Contents retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, it could impact our accounting for future transactions. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2008, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. As of December 31, 2008, 33% of our total debt is at variable interest rates, compared with 34% at December 31, 2007. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $595 million at December 31, 2008 and $445 million at December 31, 2007. As disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there have not been any material changes in the amount or type of debt or derivatives outstanding since December 31, 2007; nor has there been a material change in the extent of our exposure to variability in interest rates. Accordingly, the significant increase when comparing the effect of the one percentage point increase at December 31, 2008 with December 31, 2007 can be attributed to a substantial decline in risk-free interest rates, which are used in the discounted cash flow analysis performed to support this disclosure. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on items other than our outstanding debt and interest rate derivatives, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have $381 million and $418 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are, therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. 53",2023-12-30 20:44:57.566727
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2006. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Significant financial achievements during the year ended December 31, 2006 include: • Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $2.54 billion and free cash flow increased to $1.45 billion, increases of 6.2% and 3.3%, respectively, when compared with 2005; • Internal revenue growth of 2.7% in 2006, driven by the 3.6% increase in yield on base business, which is the highest base business yield increase we have had in at least six years; • Improvement in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, which decreased by 1.7 percentage points from 66.0% of revenue in 2005 to 64.3% of revenue in 2006; and • Nearly $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $476 million in dividends paid pursuant to our capital allocation plan. Free Cash Flow — Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance that we include in our disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we produce from non-financing activities that is available for acquisitions, share repurchases, scheduled debt repayments and the payment of 23 Table of Contents dividends. The most comparable GAAP financial measure to free cash flow is “Net cash provided by operating activities.” We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,540 $ 2,391 Capital expenditures (1,329 ) (1,180 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets 240 194 Free cash flow $ 1,451 $ 1,405 The growth in our 2006 operating and free cash flow reflects the current year improvements in our operating results, particularly those contributed by our increase in revenue from yield, which is discussed below. Revenue Growth — Our revenues for the year increased over 2%, from $13,074 million in 2005 to $13,363 million in 2006. The overall increase was largely a result of internal revenue growth, or IRG. IRG is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations. Our IRG for the year was 2.7% and consisted primarily of improvement in yield on base business and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge program. Our revenue growth from improved yield on base business for 2006 was 3.6%, which is an increase of 0.9 percentage points from the prior year. In addition, our fuel surcharge program contributed $117 million to revenue growth in 2006 compared with $157 million in 2005. The revenues generated by the program in 2006 recovered the increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel. The increases in revenue from improved yield on base business and our fuel surcharge program were partially offset by decreased revenues due to lower volumes. Additionally, the positive effect IRG had on overall revenue growth was offset by divestitures during the year. We have divested of under-performing operations, which resulted in lower revenues in the year. Although we continue to seek appropriate acquisitions, in 2006 we lost more revenue as a result of divestitures than we gained from acquisitions. As discussed below, we believe that the negative impact divestitures had on revenues resulted in improvements in our operating margins. Margin Improvement — In 2006, our income from operations improved by $319 million, or 18.7%, as compared with 2005. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues was 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Several items that negatively affected our 2005 results and are not part of our ongoing operations significantly impact the comparability of our 2006 and 2005 operating results. When focusing on our core operating costs (which are Operating; Selling, general and administrative; and Depreciation and amortization expenses) as a percentage of revenues, our margin improvement was considerable, increasing 1.6 percentage points from 13.8% in 2005 to 15.4% in 2006. The year-over-year decrease in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is largely a result of our increased revenue provided by base business yield, but is also due to the success of our cost control initiatives, which have focused on improving productivity and standardizing our practices, and the divestitures of under-performing operations. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 increased by $112 million, and as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points to 10.4%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is due largely to higher bonus expense as a result of the significant improvement in the Company’s performance, non-capitalizable costs incurred to support the development of our revenue management system and a $20 million charge to record estimated unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property audits. 2007 Objectives — In 2007, we will continue to pursue our goal of improving our profitability by focusing on revenue growth through pricing, eliminating our less profitable work, lowering our operating expenses, managing our selling, general and administrative expenses and generating strong and consistent cash flows that can be returned to our shareholders. Late in 2006, we began to see a decline in our revenue growth due to decreases in volumes. We believe that this decline can be attributed to our pricing strategy and an economic softening in certain lines of our business in certain parts of the country. Even when considering these volume declines, which may continue in 2007, we have seen that our focus on increasing revenue through yield and shedding our less profitable volumes has been positive for our 24 Table of Contents operating margins and our cash flows. As we consider the continuing effects of this approach on our business, we will continue to focus on our stated long-term strategy of seeking operational excellence and improving profitability, divesting under-performing and non-strategic operations and seeking acquisition and investment candidates, such as landfill gas-to-energy projects, that we believe will offer superior margins and returns on capital. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information Accounting Change — On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which requires compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which results in (i) the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based awards granted or modified after December 31, 2005 and (ii) the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (“SFAS No. 123”) for all unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption. Through December 31, 2005, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, we accounted for equity-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended (“APB No. 25”). Under APB No. 25, we recognized compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value. For stock options, which were the primary form of awards we granted through December 31, 2004, this meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection with the grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and all other provisions were fixed. As discussed below, beginning in 2005, restricted stock units and performance share units became the primary form of equity-based compensation awarded under our long-term incentive plans. For restricted stock units, intrinsic value is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. For performance share units, APB No. 25 required “variable accounting,” which resulted in the recognition of compensation expense based on the intrinsic value of each award at the end of each reporting period until such time that the number of shares to be issued and all other provisions are fixed. In December 2005, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans, effective December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimated that the acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of cumulative pre-tax compensation charges that would have been recognized during 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would have continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the acceleration, but do not expect to recognize future compensation expense for the accelerated options under SFAS No. 123(R). Additionally, as a result of changes in accounting required by SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market performance, the Management Development and Compensation Committee approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we grant. Beginning in 2005, annual stock option grants were replaced with either (i) grants of restricted stock units and performance share units or (ii) an enhanced cash compensation award. Stock option grants in connection with new hires and promotions were replaced with grants of restricted stock units. The terms of restricted stock units and performance share units granted during 2006 are summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of stock options and the replacement of future awards of stock options with other forms of equity awards, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 did not significantly affect our accounting for equity-based compensation or net income for the year ended December 31, 2006. We do not currently expect this change in accounting to significantly impact our future results of operations. However, we do expect equity-based compensation expense to increase over the next three years because of the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as additional awards are granted. Reconsideration of a Variable Interest — During 2006, the debt of a previously consolidated variable interest entity was refinanced. As a result of the refinancing, our guarantee arrangement was also renegotiated, significantly reducing the value of our guarantee. We determined that the refinancing of the entity’s debt obligations and 25 Table of Contents corresponding renegotiation of our guarantee represented significant changes in the entity that required reconsideration of the applicability of FIN 46(R). As a result of the reconsideration of our interest in this variable interest entity, we concluded that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of this entity. Accordingly, in April 2006, we deconsolidated the entity. The deconsolidation of this entity did not materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Certain reclassifications have also been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year information with the current period presentation. The supplementary financial information included in this section has been updated to reflect these changes. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of our assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills — The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. 26 Table of Contents Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 62 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2006, 14 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of community or political support that could impede the expansion process. The remaining six landfills required approval mainly due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes would not meet the one or five year requirements, generally due to state-specific permitting procedures. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined, an airspace utilization factor (AUF) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In addition, the 27 Table of Contents initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or 28 Table of Contents changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: • A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; • A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; • A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; • An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; • Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or • A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, the asset is reviewed to determine whether there has been an impairment. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the book value of goodwill to its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of each of our reporting unit’s (Group’s) identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. Self-insurance reserves and recoveries — We have retained a portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period-to-period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the respective Consolidated Statement of Operations line items: Period-to-Period Change Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Operating revenues $ 289 2.2 % $ 558 4.5 % Costs and expenses: Operating (44 ) (0.5 ) 403 4.9 Selling, general and administrative 112 8.8 9 0.7 Depreciation and amortization (27 ) (2.0 ) 25 1.9 Restructuring (28 ) * 29 * (Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items (43 ) * 81 * (30 ) (0.3 ) 547 5.1 Income from operations 319 18.7 11 0.6 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (11 ) 2.4 (80 ) 20.8 Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities 71 * (9 ) 9.2 Minority interest 4 (8.3 ) (12 ) 33.3 Other, net (1 ) * 4 * 63 (10.2 ) (97 ) 18.6 Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 382 35.0 (86 ) (7.3 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 415 * (337 ) * Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ (33 ) (2.8 )% $ 251 27.0 % * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison.

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator (which includes our waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs) and Recycling Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Eastern $ 3,830 $ 3,809 $ 3,744 Midwest 3,112 3,054 2,971 Southern 3,759 3,590 3,480 Western 3,160 3,079 2,884 Wheelabrator 902 879 835 Recycling 766 833 745 Other 283 296 261 Intercompany (2,449 ) (2,466 ) (2,404 ) Total $ 13,363 $ 13,074 $ 12,516 Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling services. Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a 31 Table of Contents liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site, and are normally billed monthly. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our four geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Collection $ 8,837 $ 8,633 $ 8,318 Landfill 3,197 3,089 3,004 Transfer 1,802 1,756 1,680 Wheelabrator 902 879 835 Recycling and other 1,074 1,183 1,083 Intercompany (2,449 ) (2,466 ) (2,404 ) Total $ 13,363 $ 13,074 $ 12,516 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change for Change for 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Average yield: Base business $ 461 3.6 % $ 336 2.7 % Commodity (48 ) (0.4 ) (38 ) (0.3 ) Electricity (IPPs) 2 — 4 — Fuel surcharges and fees 120 0.9 161 1.3 Total 535 4.1 463 3.7 Volume (187 ) (1.4 ) 3 — Internal revenue growth 348 2.7 466 3.7 Acquisitions 52 0.4 112 0.9 Divestitures (154 ) (1.2 ) (62 ) (0.4 ) Foreign currency translation 43 0.3 42 0.3 $ 289 2.2 % $ 558 4.5 % Base Business — Revenue growth from yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, disposal and waste-to-energy operations, exclusive of volume changes. Our revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases, but also (i) price decreases to retain customers; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided. Our pricing excellence initiative continues to be the primary contributor to internal revenue growth. In both 2005 and 2006, revenue growth from base business yield was primarily attributable to our collection operations, where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating Group. Our base 32 Table of Contents business yield improvement resulted largely from our focus on pricing our business based on market-specific factors, including our costs. As discussed below, the significant collection revenue increases due to yield have been partially offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes. In assessing the impact of higher collection yield on our volumes, we continue to find that, in spite of collection volume declines, revenue growth from base business yield and a focus on controlling variable costs are providing notable earnings, margin and cash flow improvements. Throughout 2006, increases in revenue due to yield on base business at our transfer stations and for our construction and demolition and municipal solid waste streams at our landfills were also noteworthy. These improvements were due to the practices implemented as a result of our findings from our pricing studies. The increases in transfer station revenues in 2006 were the most significant in the Eastern and Western portions of the United States. At our landfills, construction and demolition revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the West and South and municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield was provided by the East, South and Midwest. In 2005, our transfer business in the East and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the South provided the most significant revenue growth from base business yield in those lines of our business. We also experienced substantial yield contributions to revenues from our waste-to-energy facilities in the second half of 2005 and through the third quarter of 2006. The revenue improvements at our waste-to-energy facilities were largely due to significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under our long-term contracts with electric utilities, which generally are indexed to natural gas prices. Our environmental cost recovery fee, which is included in base business yield, increased revenues on a year-over-year basis by $43 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005. Other fee programs, which were targeted at recovering the costs we incur for services that are included in base business yield, such as fees for the collection of past due balances, also contributed to yield improvement in 2006. The 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield discussed above were partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste landfill disposal operations, noted principally in our Midwest and Southern Groups. Commodity — Our revenues in both 2005 and 2006 declined as compared with the prior year due to price decreases in recycling commodities. Average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8% in both 2005 and 2006, from $85 per ton in 2004 to $78 per ton in 2005 and to $72 per ton in 2006. Average prices for old newsprint were also down by about 3% in 2005 and 7% in 2006, from $86 per ton in 2004 to $83 per ton in 2005 and to $77 per ton in 2006. A significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials. Accordingly, changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold. Fuel surcharges and fees — Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $117 million for 2006 and $157 million for 2005. These increases are due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. The substantial increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to (i) increases in market prices for fuel; (ii) an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program; and (iii) the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors. Increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations, which are included in Operating Expenses — Fuel, as well as estimated indirect fuel costs, which are included primarily in Operating Expenses — Subcontractor Costs. As discussed in the Operating Expenses section below, during 2006 our fuel surcharge program recovered both components of our higher costs. Our fuel surcharge program substantially recovered these costs for the year ended December 31, 2005. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — Declines in revenue due to lower volumes between 2006 and 2005 were driven by decreases in our collection volumes, due primarily to our focus on improving the margins in this line of business through pricing. 33 Table of Contents These revenue declines were the most significant in our residential and industrial collection operations, with our Eastern, Southern and Midwestern Groups experiencing the most notable decreases. Our commercial collection operations also had declines in revenue due to lower volumes in 2006, principally in the Midwestern and Eastern Groups. The decline in revenue due to lower volumes for our collection operations was also due to a decrease in hurricane related revenues in the South. The revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our geographic regions through the first nine months of the year. Our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth in revenues due to higher volumes. We believe that the strength of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the higher disposal volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, which we believe is due to the lack of hurricane volumes in 2006, competition, impacts of our pricing initiatives and an economic softening in certain lines of our business in certain parts of the country. Also contributing to the decline in our revenues due to lower volumes for 2006 were (i) the completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in Canada in early 2006; (ii) the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity during the second quarter of 2006; and (iii) decreased volumes from our transfer station and recycling operations. Revenues due to changes in volumes were relatively flat when comparing 2005 with 2004. This was generally because of the combined impacts of (i) a decline in revenues associated with hurricanes; (ii) increases in recycling and landfill disposal volumes; and (iii) lower revenue from residential, commercial and industrial collection volumes, particularly in the East and Midwest, which can generally be attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing yield. Our revenue due to volumes generated from hurricane related services were $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $59 million decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain of our operations in the Gulf Coast region during 2005 as a result of the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues was associated with subcontracted services, which generated comparatively lower margins. In 2005, we generally elected not to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not support the required services with internal resources. When excluding the impacts of the hurricanes, revenue due to higher volumes increased $62 million, or 0.5% during 2005. This increase was largely due to (i) increased recycling volumes provided by several brokerage contracts; (ii) increased landfill disposal volumes in the Midwest, West and South; (iii) increased transfer station volumes in the West and the South; and (iv) increased residential collection volumes in the West. Also included as a component of revenue growth from volumes in 2005 was revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a municipality in Canada. The revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. These revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines experienced in each line of business in the Eastern portion of the United States and significant volume declines in our collection business in the Midwest. Acquisitions and divestitures — The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on our revenues was a decrease of $102 million in 2006 and an increase of $50 million in 2005. The significant change in these impacts is a result of our divestiture plan, which was initiated in the third quarter of 2005. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel prices; 34 Table of Contents (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include landfill remediation costs, leachate and methane collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2006 Period Change 2005 Period Change 2004 Labor and related benefits $ 2,479 $ 8 0.3 % $ 2,471 $ 84 3.5 % $ 2,387 Transfer and disposal costs 1,248 (22 ) (1.7 ) 1,270 (19 ) (1.5 ) 1,289 Maintenance and repairs 1,137 2 0.2 1,135 35 3.2 1,100 Subcontractor costs 971 34 3.6 937 26 2.9 911 Cost of goods sold 589 (56 ) (8.7 ) 645 49 8.2 596 Fuel 579 47 8.8 532 131 32.7 401 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 641 (1 ) (0.2 ) 642 22 3.5 620 Landfill operating costs 238 5 2.1 233 14 6.4 219 Risk management 291 (21 ) (6.7 ) 312 (7 ) (2.2 ) 319 Other 414 (40 ) (8.8 ) 454 68 17.6 386 $ 8,587 $ (44 ) (0.5 )% $ 8,631 $ 403 4.9 % $ 8,228 Our operating expense margin improved 1.7 percentage points, from 66.0% in 2005 to 64.3% in 2006. This improvement can be attributed to the fact that we experienced increased revenues while controlling our total operating costs. Our ability to manage operating costs demonstrates progress on our operational excellence initiatives such as improving productivity, reducing fleet maintenance costs, standardizing operating practices and improving safety. In addition, our operating expenses have declined when comparing 2006 with 2005 due in part to divestitures and reduced volumes. Divestitures and reduced volumes have contributed to reduced costs or have offset other cost increases in every category throughout 2006. The impact of our cost control initiatives, divestitures, volumes and other significant factors on the comparability of costs incurred for each operating expense category in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are summarized below. Labor and related benefits — When comparing 2006 with 2005, these costs have increased due to annual merit increases and higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance on a year-over-year basis. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) declines in health and welfare insurance expenses, due to our focus on controlling costs and reductions in operations personnel as a result of divestitures; (ii) reduced overtime generally associated with our reduced volumes; and (iii) reduced headcount due to divestitures and our focus on operating efficiencies. In 2005, the year-over-year increase in costs was generally due to higher salary and wage costs, general increases in health care and benefits costs, increased costs attributable to contract labor and increased payroll taxes. Transfer and disposal costs — In 2006 and 2005 the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at third-party transfer stations or landfills declined due to our focus on improving internalization. During 2006, declines in these costs are also attributable to the impact of divestitures and general volume declines. Maintenance and repairs — In 2006, these costs were relatively flat due to the offsetting impacts of increases in labor costs and decreases driven by (i) changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities; (ii) the impact of divestitures and (iii) various fleet initiatives, all of which have favorably affected our maintenance, parts and supplies costs. The increases in these costs in 2005 were attributable to (i) higher parts and supplies costs, which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities 35 Table of Contents and increased volumes in our Southern and Western Groups; (ii) increases in the cost of lubes and oils and (iii) increases in the labor costs associated with our maintenance and repairs. Subcontractor costs — Throughout 2006 and 2005 we experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices, which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third-party subcontractors. Subcontractor cost increases attributable to higher fuel costs were offset by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Additionally, in 2006, the increase in our subcontractor costs due to higher fuel costs was partially offset by a decrease attributable to our divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic operations and decreases in volumes. In 2005, we also incurred additional transportation costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work, particularly in our National Accounts organization and our Western Group. This cost increase was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing hurricane related services, which were particularly significant during 2004. Cost of goods sold — These costs are primarily for rebates paid to our recycling suppliers, which are driven by the market prices of recyclable commodities. In 2006, we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities and reduced recycling volumes. Additionally, in 2006, the decrease in costs of goods sold was partially due to completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility in Canada in early 2006. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2005 was partially due to costs incurred to construct this integrated waste facility. Also in 2005, we experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior years. This decrease in pricing was more than offset by increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage contracts and acquisitions. Fuel — We experienced an estimated average increase of $0.31 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005 and of $0.59 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004. While our fuel surcharge is designed to recover the cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices, increased fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margin percentages. Revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — In 2006, these costs have remained relatively flat primarily as a result of decreases associated with divestitures and general volume declines, partially offset by increases in rates for mandated fees and taxes in certain markets. In 2005, these cost increases were the result of increased volumes and increased rates for mandated fees and taxes. Certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers, and have been reflected as fee yield increases within Operating Revenues. Landfill operating costs — For 2006 and 2005, these cost increases have generally been related to higher site maintenance, leachate collection, monitoring and testing, and closure and post-closure expenses. Risk management — Over the last two years, we have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs, which can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. Other operating expenses — The lower costs in 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs in 2005, particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the New Orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts; (ii) higher rental expense in 2005; and (iii) a decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in early 2006. In addition to the 2005 items noted above, the increase in our other operating costs when comparing 2005 with 2004 can be attributed to (i) a year-over-year decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets; (ii) costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor strikes in New Jersey and Canada; and (iii) an increase in costs generated by the variable interest entity discussed above. 36 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2006 Period Change 2005 Period Change 2004 Labor and related benefits $ 794 $ 37 4.9 % $ 757 $ 16 2.2 % $ 741 Professional fees 161 9 5.9 152 (17 ) (10.1 ) 169 Provision for bad debts 49 (3 ) (5.8 ) 52 4 8.3 48 Other 384 69 21.9 315 6 1.9 309 $ 1,388 $ 112 8.8 % $ 1,276 $ 9 0.7 % $ 1,267 Our professional fees and, to a lesser extent, our labor costs and other general and administrative costs, for the year ended December 31, 2006 were increased by $20 million for non-capitalizable costs incurred to support the planned implementation of our new revenue management system. This increase and other significant changes in our selling, general and administrative expenses are summarized below. Labor and related benefits — In both 2006 and 2005, these costs increased year-over-year due to higher bonus expense attributable to the overall improvement in our performance and higher non-cash compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plan. Also contributing to the increase in labor costs in 2006 and 2005 are higher salaries and hourly wages driven by annual merit raises and an increase in the size of our sales force. These increases were partially offset by savings associated with our 2005 restructuring. Fluctuations in our use of contract labor for corporate support functions caused an increase in 2006 and a decline in 2005 as compared with the prior year periods. Professional Fees — In 2006, our professional fees were higher than in 2005 due to higher consulting fees associated with our pricing initiatives and the development of our revenue management system. However, the overall increase in consulting fees in 2006 was partially offset by costs incurred during 2005 for computer support costs related to a revenue management project for our Recycling Group. In 2005, we experienced a decline in professional fees as compared with the prior year as a result of lower litigation and defense costs and lower consulting costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as we moved from the implementation phase in 2004 to continued monitoring and testing in 2005. Other — We are currently undergoing unclaimed property audits, which are being conducted by various state authorities. The property subject to review in this audit process generally includes unclaimed wages, vendor payments and customer refunds. During 2006, we submitted unclaimed property filings with all states. As a result of our findings, we determined that we had unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property for escheatable items for various periods between 1980 and 2004. The increase in our expenses includes a $20 million charge to record these estimated unrecorded obligations. Refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the nature of this charge. Additionally, in both 2006 and 2005, our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs associated with our national advertising campaign and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including 37 Table of Contents those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $27 million during 2006 when compared with 2005. The decrease was due in part to the suspension of depreciation on assets held-for-sale, divestitures and the discontinuation of depreciation on enterprise-wide software that is now fully depreciated. The comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 has also been significantly affected by (i) a $21 million charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and (ii) adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $1 million, $13 million and $18 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes in estimate. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes. Restructuring Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure. These reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could capture by restructuring. The most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number of our operating Groups from seven to six. This reorganization has reduced costs at the Group and Corporate offices and increased the accountability of our Market Areas. We recorded $28 million of pre-tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure, principally for employee severance and benefit costs. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Asset impairments $ 42 $ 116 $ 17 (Income) expense from divestitures (44 ) (79 ) (12 ) Other 27 31 (18 ) $ 25 $ 68 $ (13 ) Year Ended December 31, 2006 Asset impairments — During the second and third quarters of 2006, we recorded impairment charges of $13 million and $5 million, respectively, for operations we intend to sell as part of our divestiture program. The charges were required to reduce the carrying values of the operations to their estimated fair values less the cost to sell in accordance with the guidance provided by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, for assets to be disposed of by sale. 38 Table of Contents During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we recorded impairment charges of $10 million and $14 million, respectively, for assets and businesses associated with our continuing operations. The charges recognized during the third quarter of 2006 were related to operations in our Recycling and Southern Groups. The charges recognized during the fourth quarter of 2006 were primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions. (Income) expense from divestitures — We recognized $44 million of net gains on divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2006, which were direct results of the execution of our plan to review under-performing or non-strategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations. The majority of these net gains was recognized during the second quarter of 2006 and relates to operations located in our Western Group. Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended December 31, 2006 were $184 million, all of which were received in cash. Other — During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recognized a charge of approximately $26 million for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000. The party that purchased our interest in the joint venture had sued us, seeking a variety of remedies ranging from monetary damages to unwinding the sale of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the arbitration tribunal ruled in the other party’s favor, awarding them approximately $29 million, which includes monetary damages, interest, and certain fees and expenses. Prior to the ruling, the Company had recorded a reserve of $3 million. For additional information regarding this matter refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Asset impairments — During the second quarter of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a $35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options. After such evaluation and considering the length of time required for the appeal process and the permit application review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial. This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s required closure in 2010. We continued to operate the Pottstown Landfill using existing permitted airspace through the landfill’s permit expiration date of October 2005. Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and equipment” had included approximately $80 million of accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system. Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use, while the remaining costs were associated with the general efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our existing applications and hardware. The development efforts associated with our revenue management system were suspended in 2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable software alternatives available to address our current needs. During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of potential revenue management system options. As a result, we entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its applications software, including waste and recycling functionality. We believe that these newly licensed applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially better capabilities and functionality than the software we were developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 for the software that had been under development and capitalized costs associated with the development efforts specific to that software. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an $18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software costs related to two applications we decided not to develop further. 39 Table of Contents (Income) expense from divestitures — During the first quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as a result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada, which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we recognized a total of $40 million in gains as a result of the divestiture of operations. With the exception of our divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill, our divestitures during 2005 were direct results of the execution of our plan to review under-performing or non-strategic operations and to either improve their performance or dispose of the operations. Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which $140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the form of non-monetary assets. Other — In the first quarter of 2005, we recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of stockholders that opted not to participate in the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of 2005, we settled our ongoing defense costs and possible indemnity obligations for four former officers of WM Holdings related to legacy litigation brought against them by the SEC. As a result, we recorded a $26.8 million charge for the funding of the court-ordered distribution of $27.5 million to our shareholders in settlement of the legacy litigation against the former officers. These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a $12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste operations divested in 1999 and 2000. Year Ended December 31, 2004 For 2004, the significant items included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” were (i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs; (ii) $12 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain Port-O-Let® operations; and (iii) $18 million in miscellaneous net gains, which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated obligations associated with non-solid waste services, which were divested in 1999 and 2000. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2006 Period Change 2005 Period Change 2004 Eastern $ 417 $ 56 15.5 % $ 361 $ 3 0.8 % $ 358 Midwest 484 58 13.6 426 40 10.4 386 Southern 804 105 15.0 699 34 5.1 665 Western 561 90 19.1 471 56 13.5 415 Wheelabrator 315 10 3.3 305 22 7.8 283 Recycling 16 1 6.7 15 (10 ) (40.0 ) 25 Other (23 ) (26 ) * 3 15 * (12 ) Corporate and other (545 ) 25 (4.4 ) (570 ) (149 ) 35.4 (421 ) Total $ 2,029 $ 319 18.7 % $ 1,710 $ 11 0.6 % $ 1,699 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Overview — Revenue growth from base business yield improvement, which is primarily the result of our continued focus on pricing, significantly contributed to the operating income of each of our geographic Groups during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Base business yield provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2006, but was driven primarily by our collection operations, where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating Group for the second consecutive year. The operating results of the Groups have also benefited from our focus on cost control and from increases in higher margin disposal volumes during 40 Table of Contents both 2005 and 2006. These improvements were partially offset by declines in revenues due to lower volumes in the collection line of business, particularly in our Eastern Group. See the additional discussion in the Operating Revenues section above. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 also compare favorably with the prior years due to the $27 million restructuring charge recognized during the third quarter of 2005. “Corporate and other” reflects $10 million of this impact with the remaining $17 million allocated across the operating Groups. See additional discussion of these charges in the Restructuring section above. Other significant items affecting the comparability of the operating segments’ results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are summarized below: Eastern — The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by $26 million in charges associated with (i) the impairment of businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program and (ii) the impairment of a landfill. The year ended December 31, 2005 was negatively affected by the recognition of $44 million in impairment charges related primarily to the Pottstown landfill. Finally, the operating results of our Eastern Group for 2006 and 2005 were negatively affected by costs incurred in connection with labor strikes. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the New York City area. The Group incurred similar costs during the first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in New Jersey, which decreased operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $9 million. Midwest — Positively affecting 2005 results compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Southern — During 2005, several large non-recurring type items were recognized, impacting comparisons to the other periods presented. These items include $13 million of pre-tax gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to (i) hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina; (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs, generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations; and (iii) higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Western — Gains on divestitures of operations were $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with $24 million for 2005 and $10 million for 2004. Wheelabrator — The electric rates we charge to our customers at our waste-to-energy facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of 2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas. The rates we charge customers are indexed to natural gas prices, which increased significantly as a result of hurricane-related production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude oil prices. This increase in rates was the principal reason for the 2005 increase in Wheelabrator’s income from operations as compared with 2004. The favorable impact of market prices for natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing of maintenance performed in 2005 as compared with 2004. Recycling — During 2006, the Group recognized $10 million of charges for a loss on divestiture and an impairment of certain under-performing operations, which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the Group’s cost control efforts. The decrease in income from operations in our Recycling Group during 2005 when compared with 2004 can generally be attributed to (i) an increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased competition; (ii) costs related to the deployment of new software; and (iii) higher subcontractor costs primarily related to increased distances traveled by third-party haulers. The comparability of operating results for the Recycling Group for all of the periods presented has been affected by variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, year-over-year changes in the quarterly average market prices of OCC and ONP have 41 Table of Contents ranged from a decrease of as much as 33% to an increase of as much as 36%. However, declines in the market prices for recyclable commodities resulted in only marginal year-over-year decreases to our income from operations during 2006 and 2005 because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers. Other — The changes in “Income from operations” attributed to our other operations is driven primarily by the 2005 recognition of a $39 million pre-tax gain resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada. This impact is included in “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization, historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments. Accordingly, these impacts have been included in Other. The impact of this 2005 divestiture gain is partially offset by the effect of certain other quarter-end adjustments related to the operating segments that are recorded in consolidation and, due to timing, not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. Corporate — Expenses were higher in 2005 as compared with 2006 primarily due to impairment charges in 2005 of $68 million associated with capitalized software costs and $31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters. In 2006, we recognized $37 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters. These items are discussed in the (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items section above. In 2006, we experienced lower risk management and employee health and welfare plan costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs. These cost savings have been largely offset by the following cost increases: (i) a $20 million charge recorded to recognize unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property, which is discussed in the Selling, General and Administrative section above; (ii) increased incentive compensation expense associated with the Company’s current strong performance; (iii) higher consulting fees and sales commissions primarily related to our pricing initiatives; (iv) an increase in our marketing costs due to our national advertising campaign; and (v) the centralization of support functions that were provided by our Group offices prior to our 2005 reorganization. The higher expenses in 2005 as compared with 2004 were driven by the previously noted $99 million charged to “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” during 2005. Also contributing to the increase in expenses during 2005 were (i) non-cash employee compensation costs associated with current year changes in equity-based compensation; (ii) inflation in employee health care costs; (iii) salary and wage annual merit increases; (iv) costs for sales and marketing programs; and (v) costs at Corporate associated with our July 2005 restructuring charge and organizational changes, which were partially offset by associated savings at Corporate. Other Components of Income Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2006 Period Change 2005 Period Change 2004 Interest expense $ (545 ) $ (49 ) 9.9 % $ (496 ) $ (41 ) 9.0 % $ (455 ) Interest income 69 38 * 31 (39 ) (55.7 ) 70 Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities (36 ) 71 * (107 ) (9 ) 9.2 (98 ) Minority interest (44 ) 4 (8.3 ) (48 ) (12 ) 33.3 (36 ) Other, net 1 (1 ) * 2 4 * (2 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 325 415 * (90 ) (337 ) * 247 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. 42 Table of Contents Interest Expense The increase in interest expense in 2006 and 2005 is generally related to higher market interest rates, which have resulted in a decrease in the benefit of our interest rate swaps and an increase in the interest rates of our variable rate debt. The increase in our interest expense in 2006 due to higher market interest rates was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in our outstanding debt, which is due to our repayment of borrowings throughout the year. We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense increase of $4 million for 2006 and net interest expense reductions of $39 million and $90 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our active interest rate swap agreements is attributable to the increase in short-term market interest rates. Our periodic interest obligations under our active interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR, which has increased from 2.56% at December 31, 2004 to 4.54% at December 31, 2005 and to 5.36% at December 31, 2006. Included in the $4 million net increase in interest expense realized in 2006 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is a $41 million reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $37 million in 2007, $33 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2009. In addition, we have $652 million of tax-exempt borrowings remarketed either daily or weekly to effectively maintain a variable yield. The interest rates of these borrowings increased over the last two years due to higher market rates. Interest Income The increase in interest income when comparing 2006 with 2005 is due to an increase in our investments in variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities throughout the year. Interest income for 2006 and 2004 includes interest income of $14 million and $46 million, respectively, realized on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. The activities of these facilities drive our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities”. The significant decrease in the equity losses attributable to these facilities when comparing 2006 with prior years is due to (i) the estimated effect of a 36% phase-out of Section 45K (formerly Section 29) credits generated during 2006 on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses as a result of a substantial increase in market prices of crude oil; (ii) the suspension of operations at the facilities from May to September of 2006; and (iii) a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our life-to-date obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment. The increase in these losses from 2004 to 2005 is due to the timing of our initial investments in 2004. These equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments. The impact of these facilities on our provision for taxes is discussed below within Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority Interest On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two special purpose type variable interest entities as a result of our implementation of FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other, net Our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations. 43 Table of Contents Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $325 million in 2006, a benefit from income taxes of $90 million in 2005, and a provision for income taxes of $247 million in 2004 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 22.1%, (8.2)%, and 21.0% for each of the three years, respectively. When excluding the effect of interest income related to audit settlements, the settlement of various federal and state tax audit matters during 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted in a reduction in our provision for income taxes of $149 million, (representing a 10.1 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate), $398 million, (representing a 36.4 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate) and $101 million, (representing an 8.5 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate), respectively. The benefit of non-conventional fuel tax credits is derived from methane gas projects at our landfills and our investments in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities, which are discussed in the Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities section above. These tax credits are available through 2007 pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, and are phased-out if the price of crude oil exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the IRS. Our effective tax rate for 2006 reflects a phase-out of 36% of Section 45K tax credits generated during 2006 and a temporary shut down of the synthetic fuel production facilities. We have developed our estimate of the phase-out using market information for crude oil prices as of December 31, 2006. Our synthetic fuel production facility investments resulted in a decrease in our tax provision of $64 million for 2006, $145 million for 2005 and $131 million for 2004, which more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities. Refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of these investments on our provision for taxes. For all periods, a portion of the difference in income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes is due to state and local income taxes. Additionally, in 2006, we recorded reductions to income tax expense related to (i) a decrease in our effective state tax rate resulting in a $9 million benefit related to the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities; (ii) a $20 million tax benefit due to scheduled tax rate reductions in Canada and the resulting revaluation of related net accumulated deferred tax liabilities; and (iii) an $11 million state tax benefit arising from the reduction in the valuation allowance related to the expected utilization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards. In 2005, we recorded additional income tax expense related to (i) the accrual of $4 million to increase net accumulated deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in the provincial tax rate in Quebec and (ii) the accrual of $34 million of taxes associated with our plan to repatriate $496 million of accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. These amounts were offset in part by a change in our estimated state effective tax rate causing us to realize a benefit of $16 million related to the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of $8 million, net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, to “Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by FIN 46(R). See Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have consistently generated cash flows from operations in excess of our reinvestment needs. However, we operate in a capital-intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: • the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; 44 Table of Contents • our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; • our liquidity profile; • our asset base; and • our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying debt and discharging other obligations. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) became law. A provision of the Act allowed U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings. For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, short-term investments available for use, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 (in millions): 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 614 $ 666 Short-term investments available for use 184 300 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments available for use $ 798 $ 966 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 94 $ 185 Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 219 205 Debt service funds 45 52 Other 19 18 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 377 $ 460 Debt: Current portion $ 822 $ 522 Long-term portion 7,495 8,165 Total debt $ 8,317 $ 8,687 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 19 $ 47 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. 45 Table of Contents Short-term investments available for use — These investments include auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment in these securities, they have been classified as current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection with landfill closure, post-closure and remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Debt Revolving credit and letter of credit facilities — The table below summarizes the credit capacity, maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, principal letter of credit facilities and other credit arrangements as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Outstanding Total Credit Letters Facility Capacity Maturity of Credit Five-year revolving credit facility(a) $ 2,400 August 2011 $ 1,301 Five-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 15 June 2008 15 Five-year letter of credit facility(b) 350 December 2008 346 Seven-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 175 June 2010 175 Ten-year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 105 June 2013 105 Other(c) — Various 75 Total $ 3,045 $ 2,017 (a) On August 17, 2006, WMI entered into a five-year, $2.4 billion revolving credit facility, replacing the $2.4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that would have expired in October 2009. This facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit. At December 31, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and we had unused and available credit capacity of $1,099 million. (b) These facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility. Through December 31, 2006 we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit. (c) We have letters of credit outstanding under various arrangements that do not provide for a committed capacity. Accordingly, the total credit capacity of these arrangements has been noted as zero. We have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain tax-exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste management contracts, closure and post-closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These facilities require us to pay fees to the financial institutions and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit. We expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future, and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs. Canadian Credit Facility — In November 2005, Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility agreement under which we could borrow up to Canadian $410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its Canadian subsidiaries as discussed above. 46 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, we had $313 million of principal ($308 million net of discount) outstanding under this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not accrue interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we initially received were for the principal amount of the advances net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.8% at December 31, 2006, which is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition of $15 million of interest expense. A total of $47 million of advances under the facility matured during 2006 and were repaid with available cash. Accounting for changes in the Canadian currency translation rate did not significantly affect the carrying value of these borrowings during 2006. Our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility. While we may elect to renew portions of our outstanding advances under the terms of the facility, we currently expect to repay our borrowings under the facility within one year with available cash. Accordingly, these borrowings are classified as current in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2005, we had expected to repay $86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility. Based on our expectations at that time, we classified $86 million as current and $254 million as long-term in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Senior notes — As of December 31, 2006, we had $4.8 billion of outstanding senior notes. The notes have various maturities ranging from October 2007 to May 2032, and interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 8.75%. On October 15, 2006, $300 million of 7.0% senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand. We have $300 million of 7.125% senior notes that mature in October 2007 that we currently expect to repay with available cash. Accordingly, this borrowing is classified as current as of December 31, 2006. Tax-exempt bonds — We actively issue tax-exempt bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, we had $2.4 billion of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. We issued $159 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2006. The proceeds from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services. Accordingly, the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in “New borrowings” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. As we spend monies on the specific projects being financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds. As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above, we have $94 million held in trust for future spending as of December 31, 2006. During 2006, we received $258 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, $606 million of our tax-exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. Accordingly, these obligations have been classified as long-term in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, we have $255 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation for financial reporting purposes. However, these bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. The classification of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use our five-year revolving credit facility. Tax-exempt project bonds — As of December 31, 2006, we had $352 million of outstanding tax-exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of waste-to-energy facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments. As of 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, $46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. Repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five-year revolving credit facility. Accordingly, these obligations have been classified as long-term in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately $61 million of our tax-exempt project bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months. Interest rate swaps — We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2006, the interest payments on $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately 64% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 36% of our debt at variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by $19 million as of December 31, 2006 and $47 million at December 31, 2005. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,540 $ 2,391 $ 2,218 Net cash used in investing activities $ (788 ) $ (1,062 ) $ (882 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,803 ) $ (1,090 ) $ (1,130 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — During 2006 and 2005, our cash flows from operating activities increased $149 million and $173 million, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. In both years, the increases were due to growth in our operating income and comparative changes in our receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and were partially offset by increases in cash paid for income taxes. The change in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, provided a source of cash of $12 million in 2006, compared to a use of cash in both 2005 and 2004 of $102 million and $223 million, respectively. In 2006, our receivables balances declined in part due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved efficiency of collections. We have created and implemented new processes to assist our Market Areas with collections. The increases in our receivables balances, and resulting uses of cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, in 2005 and 2004 were primarily related to increased revenues. However, the significant year-over-year change can partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane related services provided in the second half of 2004. We made income tax payments of $475 million in 2006, $233 million in 2005 and $136 million in 2004. The increase in 2006 is primarily the result of improved earnings, a 36% phase-out of Section 45K tax credits and the temporary shutdown of our two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. There was no phase-out of Section 45K tax credits or temporary shutdown of the coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities in either 2005 or 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 is the combined result of increased earnings and the expiration of first-year bonus depreciation on property acquired after September 1, 2001 and before January 1, 2005, which favorably impacted taxes paid in 2004. Our provision for income taxes has been significantly affected by tax audit settlements in each period presented. Tax audit settlements and related interest positively affected our net income by $158 million in 2006, $398 million in 2005 and $129 million in 2004. Additionally, we received cash refunds of $62 million in 2006 and $71 million in 2005 related to these tax audit settlements. The remaining impact of these settlements has been reflected as changes in our “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” for the related periods. The comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods presented is also affected by our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) requires reductions in income taxes payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation to be included in cash flows from financing 48 Table of Contents activities, which are discussed below. Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation were included within cash flows from operating activities as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.” During 2005 and 2004, these excess tax benefits improved our operating cash flows by approximately $17 million and $37 million, respectively. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — We used $788 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2006, a decrease of $274 million compared with 2005. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a $417 million increase in net cash flows provided by purchases and sales of short-term investments; (ii) a $110 million decline in spending for acquisitions of businesses; and (iii) a $46 million increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. The effect of these items on our cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $149 million increase in capital spending and a $142 million decline in net receipts from restricted trust and escrow accounts. Net sales of short-term investments provided $122 million of cash in 2006, compared with net purchases of short-term investments of $295 million during 2005. In 2006, we experienced net sales of short-term investments as we utilized our short-term investments and available cash to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, which are discussed below. Our spending on acquisitions decreased from $142 million during 2005 to $32 million in 2006. As we make progress on our divestiture program, we plan to increase our focus on accretive acquisitions and other investments that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $240 million in 2006 compared with $194 million in 2005, an increase of $46 million. Approximately $89 million of our 2005 proceeds were related to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada as required by a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Tribunal. When excluding the cash proceeds generated by this transaction, proceeds from divestitures have increased by $135 million during 2006 when compared with 2005. This increase is primarily a result of the execution of our plan to divest of certain under-performing and non-strategic operations. Net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $253 million to our investing activities in 2006 compared with $395 million in 2005. The decrease is due to a decline in new tax-exempt borrowings. We used $1,329 million during 2006 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,180 million in 2005. The increase occurred across all asset categories. However, our landfill and vehicles asset categories were the most significantly affected. We used $1,062 million of our cash resources for investing activities during 2005, an increase of $180 million compared with 2004. This increase is primarily due to a $266 million change in net cash flows associated with purchases and sales of short-term investments. Net purchases of short-term investments during 2005 were $295 million compared with net purchases of $29 million during 2004. The increase in our short-term investments available for use as of December 31, 2005 can generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash, which we used to fund, among other things, a $275 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that became effective in January 2006 and our first quarter 2006 dividend that was paid in March 2006. Our share repurchases and dividends are discussed in our Net Cash Used in Financing Activities section below. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a result of our short-term investments was partially offset by (i) an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets and (ii) a decrease in capital expenditures. Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $194 million in 2005 and $96 million in 2004. The $98 million increase from 2004 to 2005 is largely attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada. Capital expenditures were $1,180 million in 2005, which is $78 million less than we invested in capital in 2004. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the three years ended December 31, 2006 are related to (i) increases in cash paid for our repurchases of common stock and cash dividends; (ii) variances in our net debt repayments, which can generally be attributed to scheduled 49 Table of Contents maturities; and (iii) variances in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants. These financing activities are discussed below. Our 2006 and 2005 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with a three-year capital allocation program that was approved by our Board of Directors. This capital allocation program authorizes up to $1.2 billion of combined share repurchases and dividend payments each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. In June 2006, the Board of Directors authorized up to $350 million of additional share repurchases in 2006, increasing the total of capital authorized for share repurchases and dividends in 2006 to $1.55 billion. We paid $1,072 million for share repurchases in 2006, as compared with $706 million in 2005 and $496 million in 2004. We repurchased approximately 31 million, 25 million and 17 million shares of our common stock in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above. We paid an aggregate of $476 million in cash dividends during 2006 compared with $449 million in 2005 and $432 million in 2004. The increase in dividend payments is due to annual increases in our per share dividend payment, which increased from a quarterly per share dividend of $0.1875 in 2004, to $0.20 in 2005 and to $0.22 in 2006. The impact of the year-over-year increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program. In December 2006, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.24 per share. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Net debt repayments were $500 million in 2006, $11 million in 2005 and $386 million in 2004. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Borrowings: Canadian credit facility $ 432 $ 365 $ — Senior notes — — 346 Other debt — — 69 $ 432 $ 365 $ 415 Repayments: Canadian credit facility $ (479 ) $ — $ — Senior notes (300 ) (103 ) (645 ) Tax exempt bonds (9 ) — (25 ) Tax exempt project bonds (50 ) (46 ) (42 ) Convertible subordinated notes — (35 ) — Capital leases and other debt (94 ) (192 ) (89 ) $ (932 ) $ (376 ) $ (801 ) Net repayments $ (500 ) $ (11 ) $ (386 ) The exercise of common stock options and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $340 million of financing cash inflows during 2006, compared with $129 million in 2005 and $193 million in 2004. We believe the significant increase in stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 is due to the substantial increase in the market value of our common stock during 2006. The accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options in December 2005 also resulted in increased cash proceeds from stock option exercises because the acceleration made additional options available for exercise. As discussed above, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 resulted in the classification of tax savings provided by equity-based compensation as a financing cash inflow rather than an operating cash inflow beginning in the first quarter of 2006. This change in accounting increased cash flows from financing activities by $45 million in 2006. 50 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 111 $ 112 $ 110 $ 110 $ 58 $ 1,566 $ 2,067 Environmental remediation 44 41 29 22 12 179 327 155 153 139 132 70 1,745 2,394 Debt payments(b),(c) 815 539 681 713 247 5,305 8,300 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Share repurchases(e) 70 — — — — — 70 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 89 71 59 51 34 152 456 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 150 133 127 114 70 357 951 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2006 $ 1,279 $ 896 $ 1,006 $ 1,010 $ 421 $ 7,559 $ 12,171 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2006 include $255 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, $45 million of our future debt payments and related interest obligations will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as long-term “Other assets” within our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. (d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (e) In December 2006, we entered into a plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 to effect market purchases of our common stock. The $70 million disclosed here represents the minimum amount of common stock that could be repurchased under the terms of the plan. These common stock repurchases were made in accordance with our Board of Directors approved capital allocation program which authorizes up to $1.2 billion in share repurchases and dividends in 2007. We repurchased $72 million of our common stock pursuant to the plan, which was completed on February 9, 2007. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 51 Table of Contents We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these contingencies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2006 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including significant start-up costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements FIN 48 — Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the relevant criteria and approach for the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS No. 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. We have not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2006, all of our derivative transactions were related to 52 Table of Contents actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $460 million at December 31, 2006 and $480 million at December 31, 2005. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have $377 million and $460 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are, therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, a change in foreign currency rates would not significantly affect our fair value positions. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled products such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities. We have entered into commodity swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings, as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy, which governs the type of instruments that may be used. The fair value position of our commodity derivatives would decrease by approximately $5 million at December 31, 2006 and by approximately $10 million at December 31, 2005 if there were an instantaneous 10% increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves.

823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2007. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our pricing program, cost control measures and fix-or-seek exit initiatives continued to provide earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong free cash flow in 2007. Despite volume losses resulting from pricing competition and an economic softening, particularly in the residential construction sector, our 2007 operating results were strong. We improved our income from operations in 2007 by $225 million, or 11%, as compared with 2006. In addition, income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.7 percentage points in 2007 as compared with 2006. This earnings growth and margin expansion is a reflection of our continued focus on improving our cost structure and pricing each customer to provide profitable returns, as well as significant returns provided by our recycling operations in 2007, largely due to a very strong market for recycling commodities. Our revenues in 2007 decreased by $53 million, or 0.4%, as compared with 2006, primarily as a result of volume declines and divestitures, offset largely by increased yield from base business and higher recycling commodity prices. The loss of revenue due to volume declines in 2007 has resulted primarily from pricing competition and a significant slowdown in residential construction across the United States. In 2007, we decreased our operating expenses despite incurring $35 million in operating costs during the year for labor disputes in Oakland and Los Angeles, California. In 2007, operating expenses decreased by $185 million, or 2.2%, and as a percentage of revenue, declined by 1.2 percentage points as compared with 2006. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $44 million, or 3.2%, as compared with 2006, primarily a result of higher costs associated with the implementation and execution of our strategic initiatives that we believe will improve operations and processes over the long-term. 23 Table of Contents Our free cash flow increased in 2007 due to lower capital spending and increased proceeds from divestitures, the effects of which were partially offset by lower net cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures were less in 2007 than 2006 largely due to relatively high levels of fleet capital spending in 2006 to prepare for significant mandated changes in heavy-duty truck engines that began in January 2007. The increase in proceeds from divestitures was a result of our continued fix-or-seek exit initiative. We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,439 $ 2,540 Capital expenditures (1,211 ) (1,329 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets 278 240 Free cash flow(a) $ 1,506 $ 1,451 (a) We have included free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business and believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase our common stock and fund acquisitions and other investments. Free cash flow is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, by subtracting cash used for capital expenditures and adding the cash proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales, we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight into our liquidity. We expect that in 2008 we may continue to face challenges related to volume losses as a result of general economic conditions and pricing competition. However, we are redirecting some of the focus in our sales department from the right-pricing of existing customers, which has largely been completed, to seeking out new customers that will provide profitable growth to our business. Throughout 2007, we continued to focus on building a trusted brand that stands for quality, reliable service, safety and environmental protection. We plan to cultivate this reputation; focus on quality customer service; actively manage our capital requirements and scheduled debt repayments; and grow our business with targeted acquisitions and other investments that will improve our current operations’ performance and enhance and expand our services. We believe all of these measures will ensure our ability to return value to our shareholders. Technology Update — For the last several years, we have been introducing systems and technologies to improve our business processes and profitability. We recently have successfully deployed our FastLane system, an enterprise-wide, automated point-of-sale system for management of scale house ticketing and our Compass system, a fleet maintenance system that automates many shop functions and tracks repairs. We also are proceeding with pilots of onboard computer systems for our fleet collection operations and modules for our pricing program. As part of our focus on technology, in October 2005, we entered into agreements with a major software vendor to license its waste and recycling revenue management application and have the vendor implement the licensed software throughout the Company on a fixed price basis. In January 2007, we began a pilot test of the licensed application in one of our smaller market areas, while the rest of our market areas continued to operate using our existing revenue management system. The results of the pilot demonstrated to us that the licensed application would not work. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we terminated the pilot and the pilot market area’s operations are being returned to our existing revenue management system. Although we have continued to press the vendor to provide a revenue management application that fulfills its obligations to the Company, our negotiations have not yet resulted in a satisfactory commitment from the vendor. In March 2008, in an effort to avoid litigation, we will mediate and attempt to resolve our disputes with the vendor. Therefore, we will not be able to deploy a new revenue management system in the foreseeable future and we will continue to run our current system, although it does not provide the benefits we were expecting to get from the licensed application. However, we may be able to make enhancements to our current system. Our plans to install a new revenue management system, to make enhancements to our current system and to address the issues with the software vendor may result in cost increases, each of which could negatively affect our future cash flow and earnings. 24 Table of Contents Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information Accounting Changes — FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) and FSP No. 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48 — Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and FSP No. 48-1. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the de-recognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties. FSP No. 48-1 provides guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit. SFAS No. 123(R) — Share-Based Payment — On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which results in (i) the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based awards granted or modified after December 31, 2005 and (ii) the recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation for all unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impact of the implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position. Reclassification of Segment Information — In the first quarter of 2007, we realigned our Eastern, Midwest and Western Group organizations to facilitate improved business execution. We moved certain market areas in the Eastern and Midwest Groups to the Midwest and Western Groups, respectively. In addition, in early 2007 we moved certain of our WMRA operations to our Western Group to more closely align their recycling operations with the related collection, transfer and disposal operations. We have reflected the impact of these realignments for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our operations. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills — The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill 25 Table of Contents footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; • It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; • Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and • Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and circumstances of a 26 Table of Contents specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 54 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2007, 18 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of community or political support that could impede the expansion process. The remaining ten landfills required approval primarily due to the permit application processes not meeting the one- or five-year requirements, generally as a result of state-specific permitting procedures. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities — We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates and assumptions. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with 27 Table of Contents respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments — Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the assets’ carrying values are compared with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or an actual third-party valuation. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills — Certain impairment indicators require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by comparing the carrying value of each Group’s goodwill to its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of each Group’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the Group as a whole. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant judgments and estimates about the future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired. Self-insurance reserves and recoveries — We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues in 2007 were $13.3 billion, compared with $13.4 billion in 2006 and $13.1 billion in 2005. We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our six operating Groups and our Other waste services: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Eastern $ 3,281 $ 3,614 $ 3,632 Midwest 2,983 3,003 2,922 Southern 3,681 3,759 3,590 Western 3,508 3,511 3,416 Wheelabrator 868 902 879 WMRA 953 740 805 Other 307 283 296 Intercompany (2,271 ) (2,449 ) (2,466 ) Total $ 13,310 $ 13,363 $ 13,074 Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling services. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our WMRA Group as well as recycling operations embedded in the operations of our four geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Our “other” revenues include our in-plant services, methane gas operations, Port-O-Let® services and street and parking lot sweeping services. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Collection $ 8,714 $ 8,837 $ 8,633 Landfill 3,047 3,197 3,089 Transfer 1,654 1,802 1,756 Wheelabrator 868 902 879 Recycling and other 1,298 1,074 1,183 Intercompany (2,271 ) (2,449 ) (2,466 ) Total $ 13,310 $ 13,363 $ 13,074 29 Table of Contents The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-Period Period-to-Period Change for Change for 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Average yield: Base business $ 432 3.3 % $ 461 3.6 % Commodity 306 2.3 (48 ) (0.4 ) Electricity (IPPs) 2 — 2 — Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 35 0.3 120 0.9 Total 775 5.9 535 4.1 Volume (588 ) (4.5 ) (187 ) (1.4 ) Internal revenue growth 187 1.4 348 2.7 Acquisitions 37 0.3 52 0.4 Divestitures (320 ) (2.4 ) (154 ) (1.2 ) Foreign currency translation 43 0.3 43 0.3 $ (53 ) (0.4 )% $ 289 2.2 % Base Business — Yield on base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, disposal and waste-to-energy operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from base business yield includes not only price increases, but also (i) price decreases to retain customers; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due principally to the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided. In both 2006 and 2007, our pricing excellence initiative was the primary contributor to our base business yield growth. The increases in base business yield were driven by our collection operations, which experienced substantial growth in every geographic operating Group primarily as a result of our continued focus on pricing our services based on market-specific factors, including our costs. In 2006, increased collection revenues due to pricing were partially offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes and in 2007, the increased collection revenues were more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes. However, we continue to find that, in spite of collection volume declines, increased yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs provide notable margin improvements and earnings expansion in our collection line of business. Throughout 2007, we experienced increases in revenue due to yield on base business from our pricing excellence initiatives at our transfer stations and the municipal solid waste, special waste and construction and demolition waste streams at our landfills. The increases in transfer station revenues in 2007 were the most significant in the Eastern and Western portions of the United States. At our landfills, municipal solid waste revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the South and East; special waste revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the West; and our construction and demolition revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the South. Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base business yield, were $121 million, $76 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Commodity — Recycling prices approached all time highs in 2007 and drove the substantial revenue growth from yield. Increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we process contributed $306 million of revenue growth in 2007. Average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased by 62% and average prices for old newsprint increased by 39% in 2007. Approximately 50% of the increase in revenue from yield on our recycling operations is associated with our relatively lower margin brokerage activities. Our revenues in 2006 declined $48 million as compared with the prior year due to price decreases in recycling commodities. In 2006, average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8% and average prices for old newsprint were down by about 7%. 30 Table of Contents Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $29 million in 2007. This increase is due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. We experienced relatively flat market prices for fuel for the first nine months of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we experienced a significantly higher increase in market prices for fuel, which contributed all of the revenue increase due to fuel surcharges in 2007. Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $117 million for 2006. The substantial 2006 increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be attributed to (i) increases in market prices for fuel; (ii) an increase in the number of customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program; and (iii) the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors. Increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations, which are included in Operating Expenses — Fuel, as well as estimated indirect fuel costs, which are included primarily in Operating Expenses — Subcontractor Costs. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — The declines in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing 2007 and 2006 with the corresponding prior year periods have been driven by declines in our collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer station and third-party disposal volumes. Volume reductions in 2007 have significantly affected the revenues of each of our collection lines of business in each geographic operating Group. Our industrial collection operations have experienced the most significant revenue declines due to lower volumes. Reduced volumes continue to be significantly affected by our focus on improving margins through increased pricing. Volume declines in our industrial collection business have also been affected by the significant slowdown in residential construction across the United States. Our commercial and residential collection operations have experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in each geographic group as well. Declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations have been the most notable in our Eastern Group and can generally be attributed to the effects of pricing. In 2007, we also experienced declines in third-party revenue at our landfills due to reduced disposal volumes. The most significant declines were in our construction and demolition waste, particularly in our Southern Group. The reduction in construction and demolition volumes was largely due to the significant slowdown in residential construction across the United States. The volume declines for our municipal solid waste disposal operations have been the most significant in our Midwest Group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases. Waste-to-energy revenue from disposal volumes also declined in 2007, largely due to the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May 2007. The revenue decline due to lower third-party volumes in our recycling business was primarily attributable to decreases in certain brokerage activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility. The revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our geographic operating Groups through the first nine months of the year. Our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth in revenues due to higher volumes. We believe that the strength of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the higher disposal volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, which we believe was due to the lack of hurricane volumes in 2006, competition, impacts of our pricing initiatives and an economic softening that caused a significant decline in residential construction. Divestitures — Divestitures of under-performing and non-strategic operations accounted for decreased revenues of $320 million in 2007 and $154 million in 2006. These divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations and, to a lesser extent, transfer station and recycling operations. 31 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs included below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include landfill remediation costs, leachate and methane collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement obligations; (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2007 Period Change 2006 Period Change 2005 Labor and related benefits $ 2,412 $ (67 ) (2.7 )% $ 2,479 $ 8 0.3 % $ 2,471 Transfer and disposal costs 1,148 (100 ) (8.0 ) 1,248 (22 ) (1.7 ) 1,270 Maintenance and repairs 1,079 (58 ) (5.1 ) 1,137 2 0.2 1,135 Subcontractor costs 902 (69 ) (7.1 ) 971 34 3.6 937 Cost of goods sold 769 180 30.6 589 (56 ) (8.7 ) 645 Fuel 581 2 0.3 579 47 8.8 532 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 602 (39 ) (6.1 ) 641 (1 ) (0.2 ) 642 Landfill operating costs 261 23 9.7 238 5 2.1 233 Risk management 217 (74 ) (25.4 ) 291 (21 ) (6.7 ) 312 Other 431 17 4.1 414 (40 ) (8.8 ) 454 $ 8,402 $ (185 ) (2.2 )% $ 8,587 $ (44 ) (0.5 )% $ 8,631 The decreases in operating expenses for both 2007 and 2006 as compared with the prior year periods can be attributed primarily to (i) our efforts to maximize margin expansion by focusing on managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable costs; (ii) the divestiture of under-performing and low margin businesses; and (iii) volume declines due to our pricing program and the slowdown in residential construction. In 2007, our cost containment efforts had the most significant impact on our risk management and maintenance and repair costs, while the impact of divestitures and volume declines provided significant reductions in transfer, disposal and subcontractor costs. The operating expense declines during 2007 were partially offset by increased “Cost of goods sold” due to significantly higher commodity prices and “Other” operating expenses incurred for labor disputes in Oakland and Los Angeles, California. These expenses are discussed below. In addition to lowering overall costs the last two years, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 1.2 percentage points for 2007, from 64.3% in 2006 to 63.1% in 2007, building on the improvement of 1.7 percentage points during 2006. The improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects our continued focus on identifying operational efficiencies that translate into cost savings, revenue growth on base business yield, shedding low margin volumes and divesting operations that are not improving. As discussed above, the changes in our “Operating” expenses when comparing 2007, 2006 and 2005 can largely be attributed to our focus on cost control, volume declines and divestitures. Overall, these favorable items have been slightly offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in Canadian currency exchange rates. However, there 32 Table of Contents are several additional items that affect the comparability of our operating expenses by category for the periods presented. These additional items are summarized, by category, below: Labor and related benefits — In each year, wage increases due to annual merit adjustments have partially offset cost reductions due to headcount reductions related to operating efficiencies, divestitures and volume declines. During 2006, bonus expense was higher than either 2007 or 2005 due to the out-performance of 2006 incentive plan measures. The Company’s performance in both 2007 and 2005 was more in line with established incentive plan targets. Transfer and disposal costs — In addition to the impacts of divestitures and volume declines, the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at third-party transfer stations or landfills have declined due to our focus on improving internalization. Maintenance and repairs — Throughout 2006 and 2007, cost savings were generated from (i) various fleet initiatives targeted at improving our maintenance practices while reducing maintenance, parts and supplies costs; and (ii) changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities. In 2006, year-over-year reductions due to divestitures, volume declines and the items previously noted were outweighed by increased labor costs. Subcontractor costs — During the fourth quarter of 2007 and throughout 2006, we experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices, which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third-party subcontractors. These cost increases were offset in part by the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Additionally, in 2006, we incurred significant subcontractor costs during the first quarter of 2006 to assist in providing hurricane related services. Cost of goods sold — Fluctuations in these costs are generally based on changes in our recycling revenues because they are primarily related to rebates we pay to our recycling suppliers. When comparing 2007 with 2006, substantially higher market prices for recyclable commodities resulted in significant revenue growth and higher cost of goods sold. When comparing 2006 with 2005, these costs were lower due to a decrease in market prices for recyclable commodities and reduced recycling volumes. Additionally, in 2006, the decrease in costs of goods sold was partially due to the completion of the construction of an integrated waste facility in Canada in early 2006. Fuel — We experienced an estimated average increase of $0.18 per gallon for 2007 as compared with 2006 and of $0.31 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005. Fuel costs were relatively constant through the first nine months of 2007, but increased sharply during the fourth quarter. While our fuel surcharge is designed to respond to changes in the market price for fuel, the sharp increase late in 2007 negatively affected our ability to recover increased costs resulting from higher fuel prices within the year due to a lag in the timing of increased revenues following fuel cost increases. In each year, increased fuel costs have negatively affected our operating margin percentages. Revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel yield increases within Operating Revenues. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — In 2007, these cost declines were partially due to the resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group, which resulted in the recognition of $18 million in favorable adjustments to operating costs during 2007. In 2006, we experienced increases in rates for mandated fees and taxes in certain markets. Certain of these cost increases are passed through to our customers, and have been reflected as fee yield increases within Operating Revenues. Landfill operating costs — These costs increased during 2007 due to charges for revisions in our estimates associated with remediation obligations and changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of these obligations. During 2007 we recorded an $8 million charge to reduce the discount rate from 4.75% to 4.00% and during 2006 we recorded a $6 million decrease in expense to reflect an increase in the rate from 4.25% to 4.75%. For 2006, the cost increases as compared with 2005 generally related to higher site maintenance, leachate collection, monitoring and testing, and closure and post-closure expenses. Risk management — Over the last two years, we have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs, which can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. For 2007, the decrease in expense was largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of auto and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, reduced workers’ compensation costs. During 2006, the decline in expenses as compared with 2005 was primarily due to reduced workers’ compensation costs. 33 Table of Contents Other operating expenses — In the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we incurred a significant increase in “Other” expenses due in large part to costs incurred for labor disputes with the Teamsters Local 70 in Oakland, California that was resolved in July 2007 and with Teamsters Local 396 in Los Angeles that was resolved in October 2007. These labor disputes negatively affected the “Income from operations” of our Western Group by $37 million, including $33 million of additional “Other” operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased operating costs were primarily related to security and the deployment and lodging costs incurred for the Company’s replacement workers who were brought to California from across the organization. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our Eastern Group incurred $14 million for similar costs, which were primarily for a labor strike in the New York City area. Also affecting the comparability of our “Other” operating expenses for 2007 as compared with 2006 were (i) $21 million of lease termination costs incurred during the first quarter of 2007 associated with the purchase of one of our independent power production plants that had previously been operated through a lease agreement; (ii) lower lease and rental expenses in 2007; and (iii) an increase in gains recognized on the sales of assets for 2007. The lower costs in 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs in 2005, particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management to house and feed employees who worked in the New Orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts; (ii) comparatively higher rental expense in 2005; and (iii) a decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in early 2006. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “other” selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2007 Period Change 2006 Period Change 2005 Labor and related benefits $ 835 $ 41 5.2 % $ 794 $ 37 4.9 % $ 757 Professional fees 160 (1 ) (0.6 ) 161 9 5.9 152 Provision for bad debts 49 — — 49 (3 ) (5.8 ) 52 Other 388 4 1.0 384 69 21.9 315 $ 1,432 $ 44 3.2 % $ 1,388 $ 112 8.8 % $ 1,276 Our labor and related benefits, professional fees and other general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $24 million as a result of non-capitalizable costs associated with investments in our information technology and our people strategies. Other significant changes in our selling, general and administrative expenses are summarized below. Labor and related benefits — In both 2007 and 2006, these costs increased year-over-year due to higher compensation costs driven by an increase in the size of our sales force; increased investments in our information technology and people strategies, as noted above; higher non-cash compensation expense associated with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plan; and annual merit raises. The higher labor costs for our pricing, people and other initiatives are necessary as we implement new ways to grow our business and strengthen our ongoing operations. Our bonus expenses were relatively higher in 2006 than either 2005 or 2007 due to the strength of our performance against incentive plan measures in that year. Fluctuations in our use of contract labor for corporate support functions also caused an increase in 2006 as compared with 2005. These cost increases in 2006 were partially offset by savings associated with our 2005 restructuring. Professional Fees — In both 2007 and 2006, our consulting fees increased as a result of our strategic initiatives. In 2007, this increase was offset by (i) lower consulting costs associated with our pricing initiatives; and 34 Table of Contents (ii) reductions in legal fees and expenses, largely as a result of higher costs in 2006 related to indemnification obligations for former officers in legacy litigation brought by the SEC. Other — Our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for the years ended 2007 and 2006 included net charges of approximately $2 million and $20 million, respectively, to record our estimated obligations for unclaimed property. Refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the nature of these charges. Additionally, in both 2007 and 2006, our other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement various initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,259 million, or 9.5% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007; $1,334 million, or 10.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2006; and $1,361 million, or 10.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $75 million decrease when comparing 2007 with 2006 can be attributed, in part, to landfill volume declines. The $27 million decrease when comparing 2006 with 2005 was primarily due to the suspension of depreciation on assets held-for-sale and divestitures. Additonally, in both 2007 and 2006 there were decreases in depreciation due to components of enterprise-wide software becoming fully depreciated. The comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 has also been significantly affected by (i) a $21 million charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and (ii) adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes in estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, landfill amortization expense was reduced by $17 million, $1 million and $13 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes. Restructuring Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if we are operating under the most advantageous structure. Our 2007 and 2005 restructurings were the result of reviews that highlighted opportunities for efficiencies and cost savings. The most significant cost savings we have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related benefits component of our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. In the first quarter of 2007, we restructured certain operations and functions, resulting in the recognition of a charge of approximately $9 million. We incurred an additional $1 million of costs for this restructuring during the second quarter of 2007, increasing the costs incurred to date to $10 million. Approximately $7 million of our restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate organization, $2 million was incurred by our Midwest Group and $1 million was incurred by our Western Group. These charges included approximately $8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and approximately $2 million related to operating lease agreements. During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified our organizational structure by eliminating certain support functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number of our operating Groups from seven to six. This reorganization reduced costs at 35 Table of Contents the Group and Corporate offices and increased the accountability of our Market Areas. We recorded $28 million of pre-tax charges in 2005 for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure, principally for employee severance and benefit costs. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) $ (59 ) $ (26 ) $ (79 ) Impairments of assets held-for-use 12 24 116 Other — 27 31 $ (47 ) $ 25 $ 68 (Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale impairments) — The net gains from divestitures in all three years were a result of our fix-or-seek exit initiative, and 2005 also included a $39 million gain from the divestiture of a landfill in Canada as a result of a Divestiture Order by the Competition Bureau. Gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment charges of $18 million for operations held for sale as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Impairments of assets held-for-use — During 2007, we recognized $12 million in impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two landfills in our Southern Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for the second landfill. The $24 million of impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the impairment of under-performing operations in our WMRA Group. During the second quarter of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a $35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill in Pennsylvania. We determined that the impairment was necessary after the denial of a permit application for a vertical expansion at the landfill was upheld and we decided not to pursue an appeal of that decision. In addition, during 2005 we recorded $68 million in impairment charges associated with capitalized software, driven by a $59 million charge for revenue management system software that had previously been under development. The remaining impairment charges recognized in 2005 were largely related to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations for future expansions. Other — In both 2006 and 2005 we recognized charges associated with the termination of legal matters related to issues that arose in 2000 and earlier. In 2006, we recognized a $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000. In 2005, we recognized a $16 million charge for the impact of a settlement reached with a group of stockholders that had opted not to participate in the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998 and 1999 activity and a $27 million charge to settle our ongoing defense costs associated with possible indemnity obligations to former officers of WM Holdings related to the litigation brought against them by the SEC. The 2005 charges were partially offset by the recognition of a net benefit of $12 million, primarily for adjustments to receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste operations that had been sold in 1999 and 2000. 36 Table of Contents Income From Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 and provides explanations of significant factors contributing to the identified variances (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2007 Period Change 2006 Period Change 2005 Operating segments: Eastern $ 520 $ 131 33.7 % $ 389 $ 56 16.8 % $ 333 Midwest 471 43 10.0 428 50 13.2 378 Southern 816 12 1.5 804 105 15.0 699 Western 635 (12 ) (1.9 ) 647 98 17.9 549 Wheelabrator 292 (23 ) (7.3 ) 315 10 3.3 305 WMRA 78 64 * 14 1 7.7 13 Other (40 ) (17 ) * (23 ) (26 ) * 3 Corporate and other (518 ) 27 (5.0 ) (545 ) 25 (4.4 ) (570 ) Total $ 2,254 $ 225 11.1 % $ 2,029 $ 319 18.7 % $ 1,710 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Operating segments — Increased yield on base business as a result of our pricing strategies, our continued focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies and higher-margin disposal volumes have improved the operating income of our geographic Groups each year during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. Base business yield provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2007 and in 2006, and was driven primarily by our collection operations, where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic operating Group for the third consecutive year. The improvements in operating income have been partially offset by the effects of declines in revenues due to lower volumes, which generally are the result of pricing competition, as well as the significant downturn in residential construction and the slowdown of the general economic environment in 2007. See additional discussion in the Operating Revenues section above. Other significant items affecting the comparability of the operating segments’ results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized below: Eastern — The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes (i) net divestiture gains of $33 million; (ii) an $18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter; and (iii) a reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by $26 million in charges associated with (i) the impairment of businesses being sold as part of our divestiture program and (ii) the impairment of a landfill. The year ended December 31, 2005 was negatively affected by the recognition of $44 million in impairment charges related primarily to the Pottstown landfill. Finally, the operating results of our Eastern Group for 2006 and 2005 were negatively affected by costs incurred in connection with labor strikes. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the New York City area. The Group incurred similar costs during the first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in New Jersey, which decreased operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005 by approximately $9 million. Midwest — Positively affecting operating results in 2007 and in 2005 were reductions in landfill amortization expense resulting from changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Southern — During 2007, the Group recorded $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of its landfills. These charges were offset by gains on divestitures of $11 million. During 2005, several large non-recurring type items were recognized, impacting comparisons to the other periods presented. These items include $13 million of pre-tax gains recognized on the divestiture of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to (i) hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina; (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs, generally due to reductions in landfill 37 Table of Contents amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting their operations; and (iii) higher landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Western — The Group’s 2007 operating results were negatively affected by $37 million as a result of various labor disputes, which are discussed in the Operating Expenses section above. Gains on divestitures of operations were $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared with $48 million for 2006 and $24 million for 2005. Wheelabrator — The decline in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by a $21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 for the early termination of a lease agreement. The early termination was due to the Group’s purchase of an independent power production plant that it had previously operated through a lease agreement. Additionally, the termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May 2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income compared with the prior years. WMRA — The Group’s 2007 operating income has benefited from substantial increases in market prices for commodities and $7 million of net gains on divestitures. In addition, the Group has experienced significant returns from operational improvements, including an increased focus on maintaining or reducing rebates made to suppliers. During 2006, the Group recognized $10 million of charges for a loss from a divestiture and an impairment of certain under-performing operations, which were slightly more than offset by savings associated with the Group’s cost control efforts. Income from operations in our WMRA Group during 2005 includes costs related to the deployment of new software. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized below: Other — The changes in operating results for the periods presented are largely related to certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment income from operations used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. The unfavorable change in operating results in 2007 when compared with 2006 can also be attributed, in part, to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in April 2006. The favorable operating results in 2005 were also significantly affected by a $39 million pre-tax gain resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada. This impact is included in “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization, historical financial information associated with its operations has not been allocated to our remaining reportable segments. Accordingly, these impacts have been included in Other. Corporate and Other — In 2007 and 2006 we experienced significantly lower risk management costs largely due to our focus on safety and controlling costs. Other significant items occurring in 2007 include (i) a reduction in expenses from the discontinuation of depreciation for certain enterprise-wide software that is now fully depreciated; (ii) increased spending on the support and development of our information technology, people and pricing strategic initiatives; (iii) increased labor and related benefits costs; and (iv) restructuring charges. When comparing 2006 operating results with 2005, in addition to lower risk management costs, we experienced lower employee health and welfare plan costs, also as a result of our focus on controlling costs. These cost savings were largely offset by: (i) a $20 million charge recorded to recognize unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property, which is discussed in the Selling, General and Administrative section above; (ii) increased incentive compensation expense; (iii) higher consulting fees and sales commissions primarily related to our pricing initiatives; (iv) an increase in our marketing costs due to our national advertising campaign; (v) the centralization of support functions that were provided by our Group offices prior to our 2005 reorganization; and (vi) a $26 million charge associated with an arbitration ruling against us related to a joint venture relationship that terminated in 2000. Our 2005 operating results include impairment charges of $68 million associated with capitalized software costs and $31 million of net charges associated with various legal and divestiture matters. Also contributing to expenses during 2005 were costs at Corporate associated with our July 2005 restructuring charge and other organizational changes, which were partially offset by the associated savings at Corporate. 38 Table of Contents Other Components of Net Income The following table summarizes the other major components of our income for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): Period-to- Period-to- 2007 Period Change 2006 Period Change 2005 Interest expense $ (521 ) $ 24 (4.4 )% $ (545 ) $ (49 ) 9.9 % $ (496 ) Interest income 47 (22 ) * 69 38 * 31 Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities (35 ) 1 (2.8 ) (36 ) 71 * (107 ) Minority interest (46 ) (2 ) 4.5 (44 ) 4 (8.3 ) (48 ) Other, net 4 3 * 1 (1 ) * 2 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 540 215 * 325 415 * (90 ) * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. Interest Expense The variances in interest expense during the reported periods are generally related to (i) decreases in our outstanding debt balances due to our repayment of borrowings throughout 2006 and 2007; (ii) the maturity of higher rate debt that we have effectively refinanced at lower interest rates; and (ii) fluctuations in market interest rates, which influence the impacts of our interest rate swaps and the interest rates of our variable rate debt. We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in a net interest expense increase of $11 million for 2007 and $4 million for 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest rate swaps reduced net interest expense by $39 million. The significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our active interest rate swap agreements is attributable to the increase in short-term market interest rates. Our periodic interest obligations under our active interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR, which has varied significantly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. Specifically, the three-month LIBOR was as low as 2.75% in early 2005 and as high as 5.62% in the second half of 2007. Included in the $11 million net increase in interest expense realized in 2007 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is a $37 million reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $33 million in 2008, $19 million in 2009 and $12 million in 2010. Interest Income In 2007, decreases in our average cash and investment balances on a year-over-year basis resulted in a decline in interest income. In addition, interest income for 2006 included interest income of $14 million realized on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. When comparing 2006 with 2005, the increase in interest income was due to the 2006 tax refund and an increase in our investments in variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities throughout the year. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities Our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” is primarily related to our equity interests in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. Our equity in the losses of these facilities was $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The equity losses generated by the facilities are offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Our equity in the losses of the facilities in both 2007 and 2006 have been significantly affected by our expectations for a partial phase-out of Section 45K credits on our contractual obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses. The IRS has not yet published the phase-out percentage that must be applied to Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007. Accordingly, we have used market information for oil prices to estimate that we expect 69% of Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007 to be phased-out. The IRS establishment of the final phase-out of 39 Table of Contents Section 45K credits generated during 2007 could further impact the equity in losses of the facilities we recognized for 2007. Any subsequent adjustment to the amount of realizable Section 45K credits and related equity losses will be reflected in our 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006, we had estimated that 36% of Section 45K tax credits generated during 2006 would be phased out. On April 4, 2007, the IRS established the final phase-out of Section 45K credits generated during 2006 at approximately 33%. We did not experience any phase-out of Section 45K tax credits in 2005. In addition, the facilities temporarily suspended operations in May 2006, reducing our obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses for the year ended December 31, 2006. During the second quarter of 2006, we also recognized a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our life-to-date obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of our investment. Minority Interest On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group as a result of our implementation of FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005 is primarily related to the other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $540 million in 2007 and $325 million in 2006, and a benefit from income taxes of $90 million in 2005. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 31.7%, 22.1% and (8.2)% for each of the three years, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is primarily affected by (i) increases in our income before taxes and (ii) differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements and non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are discussed in more detail below. Other items that have affected our reported income taxes during the reported periods include the following: • Canadian tax rate changes and the related revaluation of deferred tax balances resulted in a $30 million tax benefit during 2007 compared with a $20 million tax benefit in 2006 and $4 million of additional income tax expense in 2005. • We recorded reductions to income tax expense of $9 million in 2007, $20 million in 2006 and $16 million in 2005 due to state-related tax items. These impacts were generally due to either (i) the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities as a result of a decrease in our effective state tax rate or (ii) reductions in our valuation allowance related to the expected utilization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards. • In 2005, we recognized $34 million of tax expense for the repatriation of net accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The impacts of tax audit settlements and non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are the items that had the most significant impacts on the comparability of our effective tax rate during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, are summarized below: • Tax audit settlements — When excluding the effect of interest income, the settlement of various federal and state tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 (representing a 2.3 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate), $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 (representing a 10.1 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate) and $398 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 (representing a 36.4 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate). • Non-conventional fuel tax credits — Non-conventional fuel tax credits are derived from our landfills and our investments in the two coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities discussed in the Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities section above. Pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, these tax credits are phased-out if the price of oil exceeds an annual average as determined by the IRS. Based on an 40 Table of Contents estimated phase-out of 69% of Section 45K tax credits generated during 2007, our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 include $50 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax credits resulted in a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 included $71 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits, resulting in a 4.8 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate, and our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $133 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits, resulting in a 12.2 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate. Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007 pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, at current income levels, we expect that our 2008 effective tax rate will be approximately 40% without the benefit of the tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying debt and discharging other obligations. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our business. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allowed U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings. For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, short-term investments available for use, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 (in millions): 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 348 $ 614 Short-term investments available for use — 184 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments available for use $ 348 $ 798 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax-exempt bond funds $ 117 $ 94 Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 231 219 Debt service funds 47 45 Other 23 19 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 418 $ 377 Debt: Current portion $ 329 $ 822 Long-term portion 8,008 7,495 Total debt $ 8,337 $ 8,317 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 72 $ 19 41 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments available for use — Periodically, we have invested in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic remarketing of the underlying securities through an auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment in these securities, they have been classified as current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the decline in our overall cash balances near the end of 2007, we did not hold any of these investments as of December 31, 2007. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of our debt obligations, funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2007 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 can primarily be attributed to (i) the cash repayment of $1,200 million of outstanding borrowings at their scheduled maturities; (ii) $944 million of cash borrowings, generally to refinance amounts repaid in cash during the year; (iii) non-cash proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds of $144 million; (iv) a $53 million increase in the carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps; and (v) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our balances due to foreign currency translation, interest and capital leases. We have approximately $1.2 billion of scheduled debt maturities during the next twelve months. We have classified approximately $840 million of these borrowings as long-term as of December 31, 2007 based on our intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,439 $ 2,540 $ 2,391 Net cash used in investing activities $ (761 ) $ (788 ) $ (1,062 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,946 ) $ (1,803 ) $ (1,090 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods presented is affected by our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) requires reductions in income taxes payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions to be included in cash flows from financing activities, which are discussed below. Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions were included within cash flows from operating activities as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.” During 2005, these excess tax benefits improved our operating cash flows by approximately $17 million. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below: • Earnings improvements — Our income from operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by $150 million, on a year-over-year basis, which positively affected our cash flows from operations in 2007. 42 Table of Contents • Decreased income tax payments and refunds — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $80 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely due to excess tax payments in 2006, which reduced our estimated tax payment made in the third quarter of 2007. Cash tax refunds attributable to audit settlements decreased by approximately $40 million on a year-over-year basis. • Risk management assets and liabilities — During 2007, we have been able to reduce risk management liabilities by approximately $80 million, primarily as a result of reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for auto and general liability and worker’s compensation claims, which can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates. While this non-cash reserve reduction has had a positive impact on income from operations, it did not have a significant impact on our cash flow from operations. • Trade receivables — The change in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, negatively affected the comparison of our cash flows from operations by approximately $70 million. This decline is primarily attributable to increased trade receivables when comparing 2007 and 2006 as compared to decreased trade receivables when comparing 2006 to 2005. • Increased bonus payments — Our bonus payments for 2006, which were paid in the first quarter of 2007, were higher than bonus payments for 2005 paid in 2006 due to the relative strength of our financial performance against incentive plan measures in 2006 as compared with 2005. The comparative changes in our liabilities for bonuses negatively affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $60 million. • Liabilities for unclaimed property — In 2007, we made significant cash payments for our obligations associated with unclaimed property, reducing our liabilities. In 2006, our liabilities for unclaimed property increased, primarily due to the charge to earnings required to fully record our obligations. The changes in our recorded obligations for unclaimed property negatively affected the comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately $30 million. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below: • Earnings improvements — Our income from operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by $292 million, on a year-over-year basis. This increase positively affected our cash flows from operations in 2006. • Receivables — The change in our receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, provided a source of cash of $12 million in 2006, compared to a use of cash in 2005 of $102 million. In 2006, our receivables balances declined in part due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved efficiency of collections as a result of new processes we implemented to assist our Market Areas with collections. The increases in our receivables balances, and resulting uses of cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, in 2005 were primarily related to increased revenues. • Increased tax payments — We made income tax payments of $475 million in 2006 and $233 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily the result of improved earnings and a decline in the tax benefit of Section 45K tax credits. The decline in the benefit of Section 45K tax credits when comparing 2006 with 2005 was largely due to a 36% phase-out of the credits generated during 2006 and the temporary shutdown of our two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities, which generate a significant portion of the credits, from May 2006 to late-September 2006. There was no phase-out of Section 45K tax credits or temporary shutdown of the coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities in 2005. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Capital expenditures — We used $1,211 million during 2007 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,329 million in 2006 and $1,180 million in 2005. Increased capital expenditures in 2006 were due to relatively high levels of fleet capital spending in order to adequately prepare for any potential operational difficulties that could be encountered as a result of significant mandated changes in heavy-duty truck engines beginning in January 2007. 43 Table of Contents • Purchases and sales of short-term investments — Net sales of short-term investments provided $184 million of cash in 2007, compared with $122 million during 2006 and net purchases of $295 million during 2005. In both 2006 and 2007, we decreased our short-term investments to provide cash that we used to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, which are discussed below. • Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $278 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $194 million in 2005. In 2006 and 2007, our proceeds from divestitures have been driven by the divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic operations. Approximately $89 million of our 2005 proceeds were related to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada as required by a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Tribunal. • Cash paid for acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions increased from $32 million during 2006 to $90 million in 2007 due to an increased focus on accretive acquisitions and other investments that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2005 was $142 million, and was related principally to tuck-in acquisitions of relatively small operations that could be easily integrated with our core operations. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $120 million to our investing activities in 2007 compared with $253 million in 2006 and $395 million in 2005. The decrease is generally due to a decline in new tax-exempt borrowings. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases and dividend payments — Our 2007, 2006 and 2005 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with a three-year capital allocation program that was approved by our Board of Directors. This capital allocation program authorized up to $1.2 billion of combined share repurchases and dividend payments each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. In June 2006, the Board of Directors authorized up to $350 million of additional share repurchases in 2006, increasing the total of capital authorized for share repurchases and dividends in 2006 to $1.55 billion. In March 2007, our Board of Directors approved up to $600 million of additional share repurchases for 2007, and in November 2007 approved up to $300 million of additional share repurchases. As a result, the maximum amount of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and dividend payments in 2007 was $2.1 billion. Any remaining portion of the $300 million of additional share repurchases approved by the Board of Directors in November 2007 that was not utilized in 2007 may be utilized in future years. In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new capital allocation program that includes the authorization for up to $1.4 billion in combined cash dividends and common stock repurchases in 2008. Approximately $184 million of the additional authorization of $300 million in November 2007 was not used in 2007. As a result, the maximum amount of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and dividend payments in 2008 is $1,584 million. We currently intend to allocate up to $1.4 billion of capital to dividends and share repurchases in 2008. We paid $1,421 million for share repurchases in 2007, as compared with $1,072 million in 2006 and $706 million in 2005. We repurchased approximately 40 million, 31 million and 25 million shares of our common stock in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above. We paid an aggregate of $495 million in cash dividends during 2007 compared with $476 million in 2006 and $449 million in 2005. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.20 in 2005, to $0.22 in 2006 and to $0.24 in 2007. The impact of the year-over-year increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase program. In December 2007, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.27 per share. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. 44 Table of Contents • Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and warrants — The exercise of common stock options and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $168 million of financing cash inflows during 2007, compared with $340 million in 2006 and $129 million in 2005. We believe the significant increase in stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 was due to the substantial increase in the market value of our common stock during 2006. The accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options in December 2005 also resulted in increased cash proceeds from stock option exercises because the acceleration made additional options available for exercise. As discussed above, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 resulted in the classification of tax savings provided by equity-based compensation as a financing cash inflow rather than an operating cash inflow beginning in the first quarter of 2006. This change in accounting increased cash flows from financing activities by $26 million in 2007 and $45 million in 2006. • Net debt repayments — Net debt repayments were $256 million in 2007, $500 million in 2006 and $11 million in 2005. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility $ 300 $ — $ — Canadian credit facility 644 432 365 $ 944 $ 432 $ 365 Repayments: Canadian credit facility $ (680 ) $ (479 ) $ — Senior notes (300 ) (300 ) (103 ) Tax exempt bonds (52 ) (9 ) — Tax exempt project bonds (61 ) (50 ) (46 ) Convertible subordinated notes — — (35 ) Capital leases and other debt (107 ) (94 ) (192 ) $ (1,200 ) $ (932 ) $ (376 ) Net repayments $ (256 ) $ (500 ) $ (11 ) • Change in cash overdraft position — Changes in our cash overdraft position are reflected as “Other” financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The significant changes in our cash overdraft positions as of each year-end are generally attributable to the timing of cash deposits. 45 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 106 $ 120 $ 113 $ 73 $ 97 $ 1,668 $ 2,177 Environmental remediation 44 31 31 18 18 170 312 150 151 144 91 115 1,838 2,489 Debt payments(b), (c) 1,164 697 715 250 576 4,874 8,276 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Share repurchases(e) 99 — — — — — 99 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 87 69 61 48 41 165 471 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 179 181 164 95 41 307 967 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2007 $ 1,679 $ 1,098 $ 1,084 $ 484 $ 773 $ 7,184 $ 12,302 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2007 include $192 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, $47 million of our future debt payments and related interest obligations will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as long-term “Other assets” within our December 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet. (d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (e) In November 2007, we entered into a plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 to effect market purchases of our common stock. The $99 million disclosed here represents the minimum amount of common stock that could be repurchased under the terms of the plan. These common stock repurchases were made in accordance with our Board of Directors approved capital allocation program which authorizes up to $1.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends in 2008. We repurchased $175 million of our common stock pursuant to the plan, which was completed on February 7, 2008. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 46 Table of Contents We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these contingencies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2007 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including significant start-up costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. We do not currently expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we are continuing to assess the potential effects of SFAS No. 157 as additional guidance becomes available. SFAS No. 159 — Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has elected not to measure eligible items at fair value upon initial adoption and does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 141(R) — Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the financial statements the 47 Table of Contents identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions. SFAS No. 160 — Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2007, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $445 million at December 31, 2007 and $460 million at December 31, 2006. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have $418 million and $377 million of assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are, therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign 48 Table of Contents currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled products such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities. We have entered into commodity swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings, as required. The fair value position of our commodity derivatives is not material to our financial position at December 31, 2007 and 2006. 49",2023-12-30 20:44:57.731627
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2011. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our Company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry: know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else; use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage; and continuously improve our operational efficiency. Our strategy supports diversion from landfills and converting waste into valuable products as customers seek more economically and environmentally sound alternatives. We intend to pursue achievement of our long-term goals in the short-term through efforts to: Ÿ Grow our markets by implementing customer-focused growth, through customer segmentation and through strategic acquisitions, while maintaining our pricing discipline and increasing the amount of recyclable materials we manage each year; Ÿ Grow our customer loyalty; Ÿ Grow into new markets by investing in greener technologies; and Ÿ Pursue initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure. These efforts will be supported by ongoing improvements in information technologies. We believe that execution of our strategy will provide long-term value to our stockholders. Our 2011 results of operations reflect the impact of improved recyclable commodity prices and recycling volumes, our discipline in pricing and our continued investment in our strategic initiatives, including our July 28, 2011 acquisition of the primary operations of Oakleaf Global Holdings (“Oakleaf”). Highlights of our financial results for 2011 include: Ÿ Revenues of $13.4 billion compared with $12.5 billion in 2010, an increase of $863 million, or 6.9%. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to: Ÿ Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal business of 1.8% in the current period, which increased revenue by $193 million; Ÿ Increases from recyclable commodity prices of $216 million; increases primarily from our fuel surcharge program of $169 million; and increases from foreign currency translation of $31 million; and Ÿ Increases associated with acquired businesses of $449 million, of which $251 million was related to Oakleaf; Ÿ Internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.5% in 2011, compared with negative 2.6% in 2010. The year-over-year decline in internal revenue growth due to volume was $187 million, of which $94 million relates to the oil spill clean-up project along the Gulf Coast in 2010. Revenue declines due to volume from our collection and waste-to-energy businesses were offset in part by revenue increases from our recycling brokerage business and our material recovery facilities; Ÿ Operating expenses of $8.5 billion, or 63.8% of revenues, compared with $7.8 billion, or 62.5% of revenues, in 2010. This increase of $717 million, or 9.2%, is due primarily to higher customer rebates related to increased recyclable commodity prices and volumes; the impact of higher fuel prices on direct fuel costs and indirect fuel costs included in subcontractor costs; and further increases in subcontractor costs associated in large part with our acquisition of Oakleaf, all of which have related revenue increases as noted above; 29 Table of Contents Ÿ Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $90 million, or 6.2%, from $1,461 million in 2010 to $1,551 million in 2011, primarily due to costs incurred to support our strategic growth plans and initiatives, including our acquisition of Oakleaf, and cost savings programs. We began to see the associated benefits of our cost savings programs in the second half of the year and expect the benefits to increase throughout 2012; Ÿ Income from operations of $2.0 billion, or 15.2% of revenues, in 2011 compared with $2.1 billion, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2010; Ÿ Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $961 million, or $2.04 per diluted share for 2011, as compared with $953 million, or $1.98 per diluted share in 2010. Ÿ Net cash provided by operating activities increased 8.5% from $2.3 billion in 2010 to $2.5 billion in 2011. We returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2011, compared with $1.1 billion in 2010. The following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2011 results with 2010 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2011 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $24 million as a result of a litigation loss, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges, excluding charges recognized in the operating results of Oakleaf, of $17 million related to our cost savings programs. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs and had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $11 million related to the Oakleaf acquisition, which includes the operating results of Oakleaf and related interest expense and integration costs. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a favorable pre-tax benefit of $9 million from a revision to an environmental remediation liability at a closed landfill, which had a positive impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of non-cash, pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9 million primarily related to two of our medical waste services facilities. The impairment charges had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of a tax benefit of $19 million due to favorable tax audit settlements and favorable adjustments relating to the finalization of our 2010 tax returns. These items had a positive impact of $0.04 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2010 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $55 million related to remediation and closure costs at five closed sites, which had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of net tax charges of $32 million due to refinements in estimates of our deferred state income taxes and the finalization of our 2009 tax returns, partially offset by favorable tax audit settlements, all of which, combined, had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a net favorable pre-tax benefit of $46 million for litigation and associated costs, which had a favorable impact of $0.06 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of net pre-tax charges of $26 million as a result of the withdrawal of certain of our union bargaining units from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. 30 Table of Contents We finished 2011 on a positive note with strong fourth quarter results that we intend to build upon going into 2012. Our employees are focused on continuing the progress that we have made on our strategic growth initiatives and cost savings programs. In 2012, we expect to continue to accomplish our goals of growing our revenue, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital and returning cash to our shareholders. Free Cash Flow — As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,469 $ 2,275 Capital expenditures (1,324 ) (1,104 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets (a) 53 44 Free cash flow $ 1,198 $ 1,215 (a) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the receipt of a payment of $17 million related to a note receivable from a prior year divestiture. This repayment is included as a component of “Other” within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 to the comparable period in 2010, the change is primarily attributable to decreases in our income tax payments, which have positively affected our cash flow from operations this year, as well as a cash payment of $37 million made when our Canadian hedges matured in December 2010. This current year increase was partially offset by a favorable cash benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in April 2010 and a $65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. The increase in capital expenditures is a result of our increased spending on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as our taking advantage of bonus depreciation. The year-over-year increase in capital expenditures was also affected by timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. We generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year. A more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2010 spending was paid in cash in 2011 than in the preceding year. Our ability to generate $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2011 enabled us to return $1.2 billion in cash to stockholders during the year through the payment of $637 million in dividends and the repurchase of $575 million of our common stock. 31 Table of Contents Acquisition of Oakleaf Global Holdings — On July 28, 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf. Oakleaf provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of third-party haulers. The operations we acquired generated approximately $580 million in revenues in 2010. We acquired Oakleaf to advance our growth and transformation strategies and increase our national accounts customer base while enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $1 million of acquisition-related costs, which are classified as “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. Since the acquisition date, Oakleaf has recognized revenues of $265 million and net income of less than $1 million, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following table shows adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of Oakleaf to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value from September 30, 2011 to December 31, 2011 (in millions): September 30, 2011 Adjustments (a) December 31, 2011 Accounts and other receivables $ 68 $ 2 $ 70 Other current assets 28 — 28 Property and equipment 77 (5 ) 72 Goodwill 320 7 327 Other intangible assets 92 (5 ) 87 Accounts payable (80 ) (2 ) (82 ) Accrued liabilities (48 ) — (48 ) Deferred income taxes, net (13 ) 3 (10 ) Other liabilities (12 ) — (12 ) Total purchase price $ 432 $ — $ 432 (a) The purchase price adjustments relate primarily to changes in the valuation of the customer and vendor relationships and evaluation of physical and market conditions of equipment. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets (amounts in millions, except for amortization periods): Amount Weighted AverageAmortizationPeriods (in Years) Customer relationships $ 74 10.0 Vendor relationships 4 10.0 Trademarks 9 15.0 Total intangible assets subject to amortization $ 87 10.5 Goodwill of $327 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is a result of expected synergies from combining the Company’s operations with Oakleaf’s national accounts customer base and vendor network. The vendor-hauler network expands our partnership with third-party service providers. In many cases we can provide vendor-haulers with opportunities to maintain and increase their business by utilizing our extensive post-collection network. We believe this will generate significant benefits for the Company and for the vendor-haulers. Goodwill acquired has been allocated to our four geographic Groups based on our preliminary valuations. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. 32 Table of Contents The following pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of Oakleaf occurred at January 1, 2010 (in millions, except per share amounts): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Operating revenues $ 13,693 $ 13,059 Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. 955 935 Basic earnings per common share 2.03 1.95 Diluted earnings per common share 2.03 1.94 Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Goodwill Impairment Testing — In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended authoritative guidance associated with goodwill impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two-step impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendments are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2011 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — In October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement are required to be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and, is therefore, required to consolidate the entity. This new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity. The new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events. As a result of our implementation of this guidance, effective January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others. Our financial interests in these entities are discussed in Note 20. The deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for 33 Table of Contents landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: Ÿ Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; 34 Table of Contents Ÿ It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Ÿ We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; Ÿ There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Ÿ Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Ÿ Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of our principal financial officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 33 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2011, 11 landfills required the principal financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Seven of these landfills required approval by our principal financial officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining four landfills required approval primarily due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most 35 Table of Contents significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Ÿ Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; Ÿ Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; Ÿ The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and Ÿ The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. 36 Table of Contents There are other considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below. Landfills — The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. At December 31, 2011, three of our landfill sites in two jurisdictions in the Company’s Midwest Group, for which we believe receipt of expansion permits is probable, had ceased accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for these three sites was $469 million at December 31, 2011. We performed tests of recoverability for these landfills and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of these three sites. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment or two-step impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach or a combination of the income approach and market approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of our reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon our reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units. We assess whether other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments exist by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach for the respective asset, as described above. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, an impairment would be recognized in the amount of the excess. 37 Table of Contents Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidating Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues We currently manage and evaluate our principal operations through five Groups. Our four geographic Groups, which are comprised of our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection, transfer, disposal (in both solid waste and hazardous waste landfills) and recycling services. Our fifth Group is the Wheelabrator Group, which provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. These five Groups are our reportable segments. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our five Groups, including the Oakleaf operations we acquired on July 28, 2011, recycling brokerage services, electronic recycling services, in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy services, integrated medical waste services and the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings and solutions. Part of our expansion of services includes offering portable self-storage services and fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program. In addition, we have made investments that involve the acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our five Groups and our Other services: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Eastern $ 3,115 $ 2,943 $ 2,960 Midwest 3,213 3,048 2,855 Southern 3,390 3,461 3,328 Western 3,282 3,173 3,125 Wheelabrator 877 889 841 Other 1,532 963 628 Intercompany (2,031 ) (1,962 ) (1,946 ) Total $ 13,378 $ 12,515 $ 11,791 38 Table of Contents Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel. Our waste-to-energy revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator Group, are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam. Our “Other” lines of business includes Oakleaf, our landfill gas-to-energy operations, Port-O-Let® services, portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Collection $ 8,406 $ 8,247 $ 7,980 Landfill 2,611 2,540 2,547 Transfer 1,280 1,318 1,383 Wheelabrator 877 889 841 Recycling 1,580 1,169 741 Other 655 314 245 Intercompany (2,031 ) (1,962 ) (1,946 ) Total $ 13,378 $ 12,515 $ 11,791 The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes: Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 vs. 2010 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 vs. 2009 Amount As a % ofTotalCompany(a) Amount As a % ofTotalCompany(a) Average yield(b) $ 572 4.6 % $ 724 6.1 % Volume (187 ) (1.5 ) (304 ) (2.6 ) Internal revenue growth 385 3.1 420 3.5 Acquisitions 449 3.6 240 2.0 Divestitures (2 ) — (2 ) — Foreign currency translation 31 0.2 66 0.6 $ 863 6.9 % $ 724 6.1 % (a) Calculated by dividing the amount of current year increase or decrease by the prior year’s total company revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of current year divestitures ($12,513 million and $11,789 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively). (b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related-business revenues in order to 39 Table of Contents differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related-business basis (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2011 vs. 2010 Period-to-PeriodChange2010 vs. 2009 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness (i) Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness (i) Average yield: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 198 2.0 % $ 218 2.2 % Waste-to-energy disposal(ii) (5 ) (1.1 ) 21 5.1 Collection and disposal(ii) 193 1.8 239 2.3 Recycling commodities 216 17.8 423 58.5 Electricity(ii) (6 ) (2.2 ) (7 ) (2.5 ) Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 169 37.7 69 18.4 Total $ 572 4.6 $ 724 6.1 (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.

Our revenues increased $863 million, or 6.9%, and $724 million, or 6.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The year-over-year change in revenues for both periods has been driven by (i) market factors, including higher recyclable commodity prices; higher diesel fuel prices, which increase revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program; and foreign currency translation, which affects revenues from our Canadian operations; (ii) acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Oakleaf, which increased consolidated revenues by $251 million for 2011; and (iii) revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations. Offsetting these revenue increases were revenue declines due to lower volumes. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume 40 Table of Contents changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. In both 2011 and 2010, our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield demonstrates our commitment to our pricing strategies. This increase in revenue from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations, which experienced yield growth in all lines of business and in every geographic Group. As discussed below, increased collection revenues due to average yield have been more than offset by revenue declines from lower collection volumes. However, revenue growth from yield on base business and our efforts toward controlling variable costs continue to favorably influence margin changes in our collection line of business. In 2011, revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $193 million, or 1.8%, as compared with the prior year. This revenue increase from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations; however, we also experienced yield growth from our disposal operations. Our 1.8% increase for 2011 is less than the 2.3% increase for 2010. This is due in large part to our residential line of business, in which we have experienced downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield across most of our geographic Groups, most notably in our Eastern and Southern Groups. Due to competition, it has become increasingly difficult to retain customers and to win new contracts at current average rates; as a result, in many instances, the Company has offered increased services, principally recycling services, when bidding on or renewing residential contracts and pursuing residential subscription business. Additional recycling services are typically at lower rates.This combination of increased competition and bundling of complementary services, such as recycling, in the residential line of business has put added pressure on our revenue growth from yield. Our total collection and disposal revenue growth from yield has also been negatively affected during 2011, by factors including the changes in the mix of our temporary and permanent customers in our industrial business, particularly in North and South Florida. Additionally, we saw a $5 million yield decline in our waste-to-energy facilities, primarily driven by the expiration of a long-term contract at one of our waste-to-energy operations in South Florida in August 2011. We expect this negative trend to continue into 2012 due to the expiration of a similar long-term contract that will occur at the end of March 2012. Although these factors discussed above negatively affected our revenue growth from yield in 2011 as compared with 2010, we did see a favorable rate of revenue growth from yield in our commercial line of business during 2011 as compared with the prior year. This favorable impact was driven by both price increases and additional service fees. Overall, we have found that increasing our revenue growth from yield in today’s market is a challenge given the reduced volume levels resulting from the economic slowdown, the increased service offerings in many of our new contracts, and the highly competitive environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business. Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in average yield on collection and disposal, increased by $37 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Environmental fee revenues totaled $288 million in 2011 as compared with $251 million in 2010 and $218 million in 2009. Recycling commodities — Increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sold resulted in an increase in revenues of $216 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. For the first nine months of 2011, our overall commodity prices increased approximately 26% as compared with the first nine months of the prior year. However, during the fourth quarter of 2011, we saw a decline of approximately 8% in commodity prices due to increased supply and lower demand. In 2010, higher recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue increase of $423 million as compared with 2009. Market prices for recyclable commodities increased significantly from the near-historic lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009. For the twelve months of 2010, overall commodity prices increased approximately 57% as compared with 2009. 41 Table of Contents Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, increased by $169 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This increase is directly attributable to higher national average prices for diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table above. Volume — Our revenue decline due to volume was $187 million, or 1.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011. This is a notable improvement in the rate of revenue decline from the prior year when revenue decline due to volume was $304 million, or 2.6%. Volume declines are generally attributable to economic conditions, increased pricing, competition and increasing focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. Additionally, the oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast in 2010 unfavorably impacted our year-over-year volume change by $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2011, volume declines from our collection business accounted for $327 million of volume-related revenue decline. We experienced commercial and residential collection revenue declines due to lower volume that we attribute to the overall weakness in the economy, as well as the effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by consumers. Our industrial collection operations continued to be negatively affected by the current economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the United States. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in the current year and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. Furthermore, as noted above, the overall year-over-year comparison of volumes in the collection line of business was unfavorably impacted by volume we received from the oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast in 2010. Additionally, in 2011, we experienced revenue declines at our waste-to-energy facilities, primarily driven by the expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement, which was offset to some extent by increases in waste tons processed and electricity produced. Revenue declines due to volume detailed above were offset in part by revenue increases of $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily from year-over-year volume improvements in our recycling brokerage business and in our material recovery facilities. Our continued pursuit of municipal volumes as well as the addition of new single stream recycling facilities during 2011 contributed to these revenue increases due to volume. We also experienced volume-related revenue increases of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from our strategic growth businesses and our landfill gas-to-energy operations. Additionally, our total landfill revenues increased $41 million in 2011 due to higher third-party volumes as compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in our Eastern and Midwest geographic Groups. However, our landfill municipal solid waste volumes continued to decline in 2011 as compared with the prior year due to economic conditions, increased pricing, competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. In 2010, our collection business accounted for $254 million of the total volume-related revenue decline. We experienced commercial and residential collection volume declines that we attributed to the overall weakness in the economy, as well as the effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by consumers. Our industrial collection operations were negatively affected by the economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the United States. The overall volume decline in the collection line of business was offset in part by an increase in volumes of $99 million associated with oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in 2010, and can generally be attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. However, in 2010, our landfill revenues increased due to higher third-party volumes. This increase was principally due to higher special waste volumes in our Midwest and Southern Groups, driven in part by our focus on our customers and better meeting their needs. Acquisitions and divestitures — Revenues increased $449 million and $240 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to acquisitions. The significant revenue increase due to acquisitions in 2011 was principally associated with Oakleaf, included in our “Other” business, demonstrating our current focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new, complementary lines of business. Additionally, revenue increased due to acquisitions in our collection, recycling and waste-to-energy lines of business in both periods. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of $2 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses increased $717 million, or 9.2%, when comparing 2011 with 2010 and increased $583 million, or 8.1%, when comparing 2010 with 2009. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 63.8% in 2011, 62.5% in 2010 and 61.4% in 2009. The increases in our operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 can largely be attributed to the following: Higher market prices for recyclable commodities — In both 2011 and 2010, increased market prices for recyclable commodities was the main driver of the increase in cost of goods sold, as presented in the table below, primarily due to customer recycling rebates, which also resulted in increased revenues and earnings. For the first nine months of 2011, our overall commodity prices increased approximately 26% as compared with the first nine months of the prior year. However, during the fourth quarter of 2011, we saw a decline of approximately 8% in commodity prices due to higher supply and lower demand. During 2010, market prices for recyclable commodities increased significantly from the near-historic lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, reflecting a 57% increase in 2010 as compared with 2009. Increases in cost of goods sold accounted for 41% and 49% of the year-over-year increases in total operating expenses during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Fuel cost increases — Higher market prices for fuel caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our subcontractor costs in both 2011 and 2010. On average, diesel fuel prices increased 29% in 2011 and 21% in 2010 as compared with the respective prior years. Diesel fuel prices averaged $3.85, $2.99 and $2.46 per gallon for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe the total impact of fuel cost increases, when considering both the impact to our direct fuel costs and an estimate of the impact to our subcontractor costs, accounted for approximately 23% and 17% of the total year-over-year increase in operating expenses during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Increased revenues attributable to our fuel surcharge offset the unfavorable impact of higher fuel costs in 2011 and partially offset the unfavorable impact of higher fuel costs in 2010. Acquisitions and growth initiatives — In both 2011 and 2010, we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives. We estimate that these cost increases, which affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below, accounted for approximately 42% and 17% of our $717 million and $583 million increases in operating expenses during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Recent acquisitions included the purchase of Oakleaf and a number of collection and recycling operations. In particular, the acquisition of Oakleaf increased operating costs by $213 million in the current year, primarily impacting subcontractor costs and, to a lesser extent, the cost of goods sold and other categories. The increase in operating expenses resulting from acquired businesses was more than offset by increased revenues from acquired businesses. 43 Table of Contents Canadian exchange rates — When comparing the average exchange rates for 2011 and 2010 to the prior year, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 4% and 10%, respectively, which increased our expenses in all operating cost categories. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased our total operating expenses by $20 million for 2011 as compared with 2010 and $52 million for 2010 as compared with 2009. Volume declines — During 2011 and 2010, we continued to experience volume declines as a result of the ongoing weakness of the overall economic environment, pricing, competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. We continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines and have achieved cost savings as a result. These cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below except for the cost of goods sold category, which increased as a result of additional customer rebates due to a 13% increase in recyclable material tons sold in 2011. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2011 Period-to-Period Change 2010 Period-to-Period Change 2009 Labor and related benefits $ 2,336 $ 36 1.6 % $ 2,300 $ 40 1.8 % $ 2,260 Transfer and disposal costs 937 (6 ) (0.6 ) 943 6 0.6 937 Maintenance and repairs 1,090 49 4.7 1,041 8 0.8 1,033 Subcontractor costs 948 178 23.1 770 70 10.0 700 Cost of goods sold 1,071 295 38.0 776 288 59.0 488 Fuel 628 135 27.4 493 79 19.1 414 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 602 13 2.2 589 11 1.9 578 Landfill operating costs 255 (39 ) (13.3 ) 294 72 32.4 222 Risk management 222 20 9.9 202 (9 ) (4.3 ) 211 Other 452 36 8.7 416 18 4.5 398 $ 8,541 $ 717 9.2 % $ 7,824 $ 583 8.1 % $ 7,241 The significant period-to-period changes in our operating expenses by category are discussed below. Labor and related benefits — The increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher hourly and salaried wages due to merit increases and additional expenses incurred from acquisitions and growth opportunities, offset in part by cost savings that have been achieved as volumes have declined. The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. These costs increased 2010 expense by $26 million and 2009 expense by $9 million. Maintenance and repairs — Comparing 2011 with 2010, the increase was due to higher costs in our geographic Groups largely attributable to increased fleet maintenance costs, which include services provided by third-parties, tires, parts and internal shop labor costs. The increase in expense for tires and parts reflects the worldwide increase in commodity prices. Subcontractor costs — The current year increase in subcontractor costs was primarily a result of the Oakleaf acquisition, increased diesel fuel prices, other recent acquisitions, our various growth and business development initiatives and additional costs associated with servicing our in-plant services customers. Oakleaf utilizes a nationwide network of third-party haulers to service its customers, which increased our subcontractor costs by $153 million during the second half of 2011 after completing the acquisition on July 28, 2011. These increases were partially offset by the impact of an additional $54 million in prior year costs attributable to oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast during 2010. The 2010 increase in subcontractor costs was largely the result of these oil spill clean-up activities, as well as higher diesel fuel prices when compared with 2009. 44 Table of Contents Cost of goods sold — The cost increases during 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increases in the recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of higher market prices for recyclable commodities. The increase in costs in 2011 was also driven by (i) increases in the volume of materials processed at our existing recycling facilities; and (ii) increases resulting from the Oakleaf acquisition and other recently acquired businesses. Fuel — The costs increases for 2011 and 2010 were a result of higher market prices for diesel fuel. Landfill operating costs — The changes in these costs during 2011 and 2010 were due largely to the recognition of additional estimated expense associated with environmental remediation liabilities of $50 million at four closed sites during 2010. During 2011, the Company recognized a $9 million favorable revision to an environmental liability at one of these sites based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternative selected by the EPA. The changes in this category for the years presented were also significantly impacted by the changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. As a result of changes in U.S. Treasury rates, we recognized $17 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2011, $2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010, and $35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009. During 2011, the discount rate we use decreased from 3.50% to 2.00%. Over the course of 2010, the discount rate decreased slightly from 3.75% to 3.50% and during 2009, the rate increased from 2.25% to 3.75%. Risk management — The increase in risk management costs during 2011 was primarily a result of increased costs associated with auto and general liability claims in the current year and the prior year recognition of favorable adjustments associated with prior period claims that were higher than similar favorable adjustments recognized during 2011. Other — The 2011 increase was attributable, in part, to our various growth and business development initiatives and recently acquired businesses, including Oakleaf. These increases were partially offset by prior year costs related to the oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast in 2010. The 2010 increase was attributable, in part, to our various growth and business development initiatives, oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast, and recently acquired businesses. These cost increases in 2010 were partially offset by an increase in gains recognized from the sale of surplus real estate assets. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $90 million, or 6.2%, and $97 million, or 7.1% when comparing 2011 with 2010 and 2010 with 2009, respectively. The increases in both years are largely due to (i) increased costs of approximately $53 million and $52 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings, including our acquisition of Oakleaf in 2011 and (ii) increased costs of $9 million and $23 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, resulting from improvements we are making to our information technology systems. Additionally, during 2011 we experienced increased consulting costs of $37 million incurred in connection with the start-up phase of new cost savings programs focusing on procurement and operational and back-office efficiency. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 11.6% in 2011, 11.7% in 2010 and 11.6% in 2009. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Period-to-PeriodChange 2009 Labor and related benefits $ 913 $ 68 8.0 % $ 845 $ 70 9.0 % $ 775 Professional fees 185 10 5.7 175 8 4.8 167 Provision for bad debts 47 2 4.4 45 (9 ) (16.7 ) 54 Other 406 10 2.5 396 28 7.6 368 $ 1,551 $ 90 6.2 % $ 1,461 $ 97 7.1 % $ 1,364 Labor and related benefits — In 2011, our labor and related benefits costs increased primarily due to (i) higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our strategic growth plans, optimization initiatives, cost savings programs, and acquisition of Oakleaf; (ii) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases; and (iii) higher non-cash compensation costs incurred for our performance share units and our stock option equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plan, or LTIP, offset partially by lower costs associated with our executive salary deferral plan, the costs of which are directly affected by equity-market conditions. The stock option equity awards that the Company granted in 2011 and 2010 provide that such options will continue to vest on the schedule provided in the award agreement following an employee’s retirement. Because retirement-eligible employees are not required to provide any future service to vest in these awards, we immediately recognized all of the compensation expense associated with stock option awards granted to retirement eligible employees. In 2011, the composition of our annual LTIP award grant was modified to use stock options to a greater extent and to reduce the number of performance share units awarded. Accordingly, costs increased in 2011 due to the significant increase in the number of stock option awards granted in 2011 over those granted in 2010 and an increase in the number of retirement-eligible employees receiving those awards. In 2010, our labor and related benefits costs increased primarily due to (i) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases; (ii) higher compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by our strategic growth plans; (iii) additional bonus expense in 2010 because our performance against targets established by our annual incentive plans was stronger in 2010 compared with 2009; (iv) increased contract labor costs as a result of our current focus on optimizing our information technology systems; (v) increased severance costs; and (vi) higher non-cash compensation costs incurred for equity awards granted under our LTIP. During the second quarter of 2009, we reversed all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a determination that it was no longer probable that the targets established for that award would be met. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2010 we immediately recognized all of the compensation expense associated with stock option awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. We did not incur similar charges in 2009 because this retirement provision was not included in any of the equity awards that were granted during 2009. Professional fees — During 2011, our professional fees increased due to consulting fees, primarily associated with the start-up phase of new cost savings programs, although these fees declined significantly during the second half of the year. We have begun to see the associated benefits of these programs and expect the benefits to increase throughout 2012. This increase was offset to a certain extent by lower legal fees in 2011 as compared with 2010. This reduction in legal fees in 2011 was primarily the result of the settlement in 2010 of a lawsuit related to the abandonment of revenue management software. In 2010, our professional fees increased due to consulting fees, driven primarily by improvements we are made to our information technology systems and investments we made to support our strategic growth plans. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees in 2010 as compared with 2009. Provision for bad debts — Our provision for bad debts was slightly higher in 2011 as compared with 2010, but both 2011 and 2010 were notably lower than 2009. Our provision was higher in 2009 as a result of the Company’s assessment of the weak economic environment in the beginning of 2009 and the resulting impacts on our collection risk. However, due in part to management’s continued focus on the collection of our receivables, our collection risk has moderated since 2009, thus resulting in a lower provision in both 2010 and 2011. 46 Table of Contents Other — During 2011 and 2010, we experienced increases in our computer costs, due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems, and litigation loss and settlement costs. Also driving the increase during 2010 was increased marketing and advertising costs, driven in part by our strategic growth plans. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Period-to-PeriodChange 2009 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 800 $ 19 2.4 % $ 781 $ 2 0.3 % $ 779 Amortization of landfill airspace 378 6 1.6 372 14 3.9 358 Amortization of intangible assets 51 10 24.4 41 12 41.4 29 $ 1,229 $ 35 2.9 % $ 1,194 $ 28 2.4 % $ 1,166 The increases in amortization expense of intangible assets in 2011 and 2010 are due to our focus on the growth and development of our business through acquisitions and other investments. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2011 is primarily related to the amortization of customer lists, which were acquired (i) through our acquisition of Oakleaf, (ii) by our Southern Group and (iii) by our recycling and electronic brokerage services business. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2010 is primarily related to the amortization of definite-lived operating permits acquired by our healthcare solutions operations, customer lists acquired by our Southern and Midwest Groups and gas rights acquired by our renewable energy operations. Restructuring Beginning in July 2011, we took steps to streamline our organization as part of our cost savings programs. This reorganization eliminated over 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including approximately 300 open positions. Additionally, subsequent to our acquisition of Oakleaf, we incurred charges in connection with restructuring that organization. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a total of $19 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $18 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with this reorganization. In January 2009, we streamlined our organization by (i) consolidating our Market Areas from 45 Market Areas to 25 Market Areas; (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations with our solid waste businesses in our four geographic Groups; and (iii) realigning our Corporate organization with this new structure in order to provide support functions more efficiently. This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this restructuring, of which $41 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. In 2010, we recognized $2 million of income related to the reversal of pre-tax restructuring charges recorded in 2009. 47 Table of Contents (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Income) expense from divestitures $ 1 $ (1 ) $ — Asset impairments 9 — 83 Other — (77 ) — $ 10 $ (78 ) $ 83 Asset Impairments — During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized impairment charges relating primarily to two facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of the closure of one site and of continuing operating losses at the other site. We wrote down the net book values of the sites to their estimated fair values. Through December 31, 2008, we capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs associated with the development of a new waste and recycling revenue management system. A significant portion of these costs was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts required to develop and configure that software for our use. After a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts associated with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007. During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated with the development and implementation of the licensed software. Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $51 million for the abandonment of the licensed software. We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by our Western Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair a landfill in California as a result of a change in our expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a charge required to write down certain of our investments in portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those operations. Other — We filed a lawsuit in March 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009. In April 2010, we settled the lawsuit and received a one-time cash payment. The settlement increased our “Income from operations” for the year ended December 31, 2010 by $77 million. Income from Operations by Reportable Segment The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Period-to-PeriodChange 2009 Reportable segments: Eastern $ 559 $ 43 8.3 % $ 516 $ 33 6.8 % $ 483 Midwest 646 113 21.2 533 83 18.4 450 Southern 779 (65 ) (7.7 ) 844 76 9.9 768 Western 576 7 1.2 569 48 9.2 521 Wheelabrator 168 (46 ) (21.5 ) 214 (21 ) (8.9 ) 235 Other (116 ) 19 (14.1 ) (135 ) 1 (0.7 ) (136 ) Corporate and other (584 ) (159 ) 37.4 (425 ) 9 (2.1 ) (434 ) Total $ 2,028 $ (88 ) (4.2 )% $ 2,116 $ 229 12.1 % $ 1,887 48 Table of Contents Reportable Segments — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic Groups during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 are summarized below: Ÿ revenue growth from yield on our base business; Ÿ market prices for recyclable commodities reflected significant year-over-year improvement in both 2011 and 2010; Ÿ the accretive benefits of recent acquisitions during 2011and 2010; Ÿ continued volume declines in 2010, and to a lesser extent in 2011, due to the economy, pricing, competition and increasing focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers; Ÿ higher salaries and wages due to annual merit increases in both 2011 and 2010 for salaried and hourly employees. The increases during 2011 were offset, in large part, by the transfers of certain field sales organization employees to the Corporate sales organization; Ÿ higher maintenance and repair costs during 2011; and Ÿ restructuring charges during 2011 and 2009. Other significant items affecting the comparability of our Groups’ results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Eastern — During 2009, the Group recognized (i) an $18 million increase in revenues and income from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of our landfills; and (ii) a $9 million charge related to bargaining unit employees in New Jersey agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund. Midwest — The income from operations of our Midwest Group in 2010 was significantly affected by the recognition of charges of $26 million as a result of employees of five bargaining units in Michigan and Ohio agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan. Additionally, when comparing the average exchange rate in 2010 with 2009, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10%, which increased the Group’s income from operations. The effects of foreign currency translation were the most significant to this Group because substantially all of our Canadian operations are managed by our Midwest Group. Southern — The decrease in income from operations of our Southern Group for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with 2010 was driven largely by the volume decline previously discussed, which includes the unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2010 project volumes resulting from oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast. Additionally, the Group recognized a charge of $11 million in 2011 related to litigation reserves. This charge was initially recognized in “Other” during the fourth quarter of 2010. Western — The Group’s income from operations included additional “Selling, general and administrative” expense of $24 million recognized in 2011 as a result of a litigation loss and $12 million recognized in 2010 in connection with a litigation settlement. The Group’s 2009 income from operations included the recognition of an impairment charge of $27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in California. Further affecting the comparison of results was the recognition of $7 million of favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense during 2010 associated with our obligations for landfill final capping, closure and post-closure and net expenses of $5 million recognized for adjustments related to these obligations during 2009. The unfavorable adjustments during 2009 primarily related to a closed landfill in Los Angeles, California for which the Group recognized additional amortization expense. Wheelabrator — The decrease in income from operations of our Wheelabrator Group for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with 2010 was driven largely by (i) lower revenues due to the expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement that expired December 31, 2010 and the expiration of other long-term contracts at our waste-to-energy and independent power facilities; (ii) an increase in year-to-date costs at our facility in Portsmouth, Virginia that we acquired in April 2010 as we 49 Table of Contents continue to refurbish the facility; and (iii) additional expenses recognized during 2011 for litigation reserves and associated compliance costs. A portion of the expenses for litigation reserves and associated costs were initially recognized in “Other” during the fourth quarter of 2010. The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by the efforts to control costs across each of our facilities. The decrease in the Group’s 2010 income from operations as compared with 2009 was driven by an increase in maintenance-related outages as compared with the prior year, which resulted in decreased electricity generation and increased plant maintenance costs. These increases were attributable to the acceleration of repair and maintenance expenses at our facility in Portsmouth, Virginia that we acquired in April 2010, and expenses at certain of our other facilities. The Group also experienced an increase in litigation settlement costs as compared with 2009. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the benefit of increased revenues from the sale of metals. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Other — Our “Other” income from operations include (i) the effects of those elements of our in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy operations, and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Sustainability Services, Renewable Energy and Strategic Accounts organizations, including Oakleaf, respectively, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services; and (iii) the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the impacts of (i) non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for the Groups or financing for our Canadian operations; and (ii) certain year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to the reportable segments that were not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. Significant items affecting the comparability of income from operations for the periods presented include (i) the reversal in 2011 of adjustments initially recorded in consolidation in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to our reportable segments, which are now included in the measure of segment income from operations in 2011 and (ii) losses from our growth initiatives. The adjustments recorded in consolidation were primarily related to $15 million of additional expense for litigation reserves and associated costs in our Southern and Wheelabrator Groups. The losses from our growth initiatives are expected to drive year-over-year improvements in future periods. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ a benefit in 2010 of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement that occurred in April 2010 and $51 million in charges recognized during 2009 for the abandonment of licensed software associated with the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009; Ÿ increases in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for the periods presented as a result of cost increases attributable to (i) consulting fees primarily associated with our new cost savings programs focusing on procurement, operational efficiency and back office efficiency and (ii) additional compensation expense due to annual salary and wage increases, headcount increases to support the Company’s strategic growth plans, and an increase in costs attributable to our equity compensation. Also affecting the comparison during the periods presented is increased compensation expense during 2011 due to transfers of certain field sales organization employees to the Corporate sales organization and a favorable litigation settlement that occurred in 2010; Ÿ the recognition of a $9 million favorable adjustment during 2011 and net charges of $50 million during 2010 for estimates associated with environmental remediation liabilities at certain of our closed sites; Ÿ changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. As a result of changes in U.S. Treasury rates, we recognized $17 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2011 and $2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010, compared with $35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009; 50 Table of Contents Ÿ an increase in 2011 risk management costs, primarily due to increased costs associated with auto and general liability claims and the recognition of a favorable adjustment in 2010 associated with prior period claims; and Ÿ the recognition of $9 million in restructuring charges during 2009. Renewable Energy Operations We have extracted value from the waste streams we manage for years, and we are focusing on increasing our ability to do so, particularly in the field of clean and renewable energy. Most significantly, our current operations produce renewable energy through the waste-to-energy facilities that are managed by our Wheelabrator Group and our landfill gas-to-energy operations. We are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our existing renewable energy service offerings to ensure that we can respond to the shifting demands of consumers and to ensure that we are acting as a leader in environmental stewardship. We are disclosing the following supplemental information related to the operating results of our renewable energy operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions) because we believe that it provides information related to the significance of our current renewable energy operations, the profitability of these operations and the costs we are incurring to develop these operations: 2011 2010 Wheelabrator Landfill Gas-to-Energy(a) GrowthOpportunities(b) Total Wheelabrator Landfill Gas-to-Energy(a) GrowthOpportunities(b) Total Operating revenues (including intercompany) $ 877 $ 140 $ — $ 1,017 $ 889 $ 126 $ — $ 1,015 Costs and expenses: Operating 548 60 2 610 512 51 2 565 Selling, general & administrative 92 3 3 98 99 3 3 105 Depreciation and amortization 67 28 — 95 64 24 — 88 Restructuring and unusual items 2 — — 2 — — — — 709 91 5 805 675 78 5 758 Income (loss) from operations $ 168 $ 49 $ (5 ) $ 212 $ 214 $ 48 $ (5 ) $ 257 (a) Our landfill gas-to-energy business focuses on generating a renewable energy source from the methane that is produced as waste decomposes. The operating results include the revenues and expenses of landfill gas-to-energy plants that we own and operate, as well as revenues generated from the sale of landfill gas to third-party owner/operators. The operating results of our landfill gas-to-energy business are included within our geographic reportable segments and “Other”. (b) Includes businesses and entities we have acquired or invested in through our organic growth group’s business development efforts. These businesses include a landfill gas-to-LNG facility; landfill gas-to-diesel fuels technologies; organic waste streams-to-fuels technologies; and other engineered fuels technologies. The operating results of our Growth Opportunities are included within “Other” in our assessment of our income from operations by segment. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $481 million in 2011, $473 million in 2010 and $426 million in 2009. When comparing 2011 with 2010, our interest expense increased only slightly in spite of a more significant increase in our debt balances over the course of the year of about $850 million. This was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate that has been achieved by refinancing debt with scheduled maturities in 2011 with debt at much lower fixed interest rates; (ii) the impacts that lower market interest rates had on the cost of certain of our tax-exempt debt; and (iii) a $5 million increase in capitalized interest due primarily to higher capital spending in 2011. In 2011, these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes. 51 Table of Contents When comparing 2010 with 2009, the significant increase in our interest expense was primarily due to (i) the issuance of an additional $600 million of senior notes in November 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010, (ii) significantly higher costs related to our revolving credit facility, and (iii) decreased benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding. These increases in interest expense were offset, in part, by a decline in market interest rates, which reduced the interest costs of our tax-exempt borrowings and our Canadian credit facility. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities Beginning in April 2010, our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” has been primarily related to our noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties, as well as (i) noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. In January 2011, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $511 million in 2011, $629 million in 2010 and $413 million in 2009. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 33.6%, 38.5% and 28.1%, for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) the utilization of a capital loss carry-back; (iii) the realization of state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards; (iv) changes in effective state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (v) tax audit settlements; and (vi) the impact of federal low-income housing and refined coal tax credits. The impacts of these items are summarized below: Ÿ Capital Loss Carry-back — During 2009, we generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. We determined that the capital loss could be utilized to offset capital gains from 2006 and 2007, which resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income taxes” of $65 million. Ÿ State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards — During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we utilized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our “Provision for income taxes” for those periods of $4 million, $4 million, and $35 million, respectively. Ÿ Canadian and State Tax Rate Changes — During 2011, our state deferred income taxes increased by $3 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized. During 2010, our current state tax rate increased from 6.25% to 6.75% resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of $5 million. In addition, our state deferred income taxes increased $37 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized. During 2009, our current state tax rate increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our deferred state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 5.75%, resulting in an increase to our income taxes of $3 million and $6 million, respectively. Also affecting 2009 was the reduction of provincial tax rates in Ontario, which resulted in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. Ÿ Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ÿ Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credits — Our federal low-income housing investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our federal low-income housing investment. 52 Table of Contents Ÿ Refined Coal Investment Tax Credits — Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal investment. Our acquisition of Oakleaf did not materially impact our provision for income taxes or the effective income tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2011. We did receive, as part of the acquisition, income tax attributes (primarily federal and state net operating losses). While these tax attributes, when realized, will not affect our overall provision for income taxes, they will have a favorable impact on our cash taxes, although we do not anticipate the impact to be material to our overall cash flow from operations. We expect our 2012 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5% based on expected income levels, projected federal tax credits and other permanent items. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act, signed into law on December 17, 2010, included an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance through the end of 2012 and increased the amount of qualifying capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from 50% to 100%. The 100% depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in service from September 8, 2010 through December 31, 2011. The acceleration of deductions on 2011 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our 2011 effective tax rate. However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2011 cash taxes by approximately $190 million. Taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $48 million in 2011, $49 million in 2010 and $66 million in 2009. These amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group. The comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has been affected by (i) our January 2010 acquisition of a controlling financial interest in a portable self-storage business and (ii) the deconsolidation of certain final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts as a result of our implementation of authoritative accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2010, associated with variable interest entities. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2011 and 2010. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Remaining cubic yards 4,730 621 5,351 4,793 600 5,393 Remaining tonnage 4,485 621 5,106 4,391 603 4,994 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2011 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 42 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 33 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 48 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 53 Table of Contents The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2011, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 11 9 32 69 90 211 Operated through lease(a) 5 4 4 5 7 25 Operating contracts(b) 10 6 8 5 6 35 Total landfills 26 19 44 79 103 271 (a) From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance, beginning of year 4,391 603 4,994 4,075 726 4,801 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures — — — 14 — 14 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 101 101 — 120 120 Expansion permits granted(b) 84 (84 ) — 238 (238 ) — Airspace consumed (90 ) — (90 ) (91 ) — (91 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 100 1 101 155 (5 ) 150 Balance, end of year 4,485 621 5,106 4,391 603 4,994 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at eight of our landfills during 2011 and 13 of our landfills during 2010, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on 54 Table of Contents improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2011 and 2010 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2011 2010 # ofSites TotalTons Tonsper Day # ofSites TotalTons Tonsper Day Solid waste landfills 266 (a) 91,130 334 266 91,863 336 Hazardous waste landfills 5 599 2 5 667 2 271 91,729 336 271 92,530 338 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 1 49 3 295 91,778 (b) 92,825 (b) (a) In 2011, we developed one landfill and closed one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.4 million tons at December 31, 2011 and 1.7 million tons at December 31, 2010 that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2011, our closed sites management group managed 207 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2011 (in millions): Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2010 $ 12,777 $ (6,792 ) $ 5,985 Capital additions 398 — 398 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 49 — 49 Acquisitions — — — Amortization of landfill airspace — (378 ) (378 ) Foreign currency translation (32 ) 8 (24 ) Asset retirements and other adjustments (252 ) 231 (21 ) December 31, 2011 $ 12,940 $ (6,931 ) $ 6,009 55 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2012, and approximately $1 billion in 2013 and 2014 combined for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations, and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2011 (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2010 $ 1,266 $ 284 Obligations incurred and capitalized 49 — Obligations settled (80 ) (37 ) Interest accretion 84 6 Revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions (30 ) 23 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 3 (3 ) December 31, 2011 $ 1,292 $ 273 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 84 $ 82 $ 80 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 23 8 (30 ) Leachate and methane collection and treatment 76 64 69 Landfill remediation costs — 63 23 Other landfill site costs 72 77 80 Total landfill operating costs $ 255 $ 294 $ 222 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Additionally, in 2010, we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects. As these remediation projects progressed, more defined plans were developed, resulting in a net increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies. In 2011, we had a favorable revision to an environmental remediation liability at a closed site based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternative selected by the EPA. 56 Table of Contents Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: Ÿ the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and Ÿ the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from final landfill capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 378 $ 372 $ 358 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 90 91 92 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.19 $ 4.08 $ 3.90 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 271 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 has also been affected by the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was reduced by $11 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $14 million in 2009, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations; and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our capital allocation program that provides for dividend payments and share repurchases. 57 Table of Contents Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 258 $ 539 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 123 $ 124 Tax-exempt bond funds 14 14 Other 15 8 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 152 $ 146 Debt: Current portion $ 631 $ 233 Long-term portion 9,125 8,674 Total debt $ 9,756 $ 8,907 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 102 $ 79 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans, which has increased our level of capital spending, acquisitions and investments. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of (i) funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations; and (ii) funds received from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 were primarily due to (i) net debt borrowings of $698 million; (ii) $100 million in non-cash proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings; and (ii) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, interest accretion and capital leases. As of December 31, 2011, we had (i) $925 million of debt maturing within twelve months, including $150 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, U.S.$137 million of advances outstanding under our Canadian credit facility, $400 million of 6.375% senior notes that mature in November 2012 and $168 million of tax-exempt bonds and (ii) $305 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, this debt must be classified as current unless we have the intent and ability to refinance it on a long-term basis. We have the intent and ability to refinance $599 million of this debt on a long-term basis and have classified the remaining $631 million as current obligations as of December 31, 2011. In January 2012, we borrowed an additional $50 million under our revolving credit facility, increasing the total loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility to $200 million. 58 Table of Contents We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2011 2010 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 1,012 $ 1,138 Letter of credit facilities(b) 502 505 Other(c) 251 237 $ 1,765 $ 1,880 (a) In May 2011, we amended and restated our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility as a result of changes in market conditions, which significantly reduced the cost of the facility. We also extended the term through May 2016. At December 31, 2011, we had $150 million of outstanding borrowings and $1,012 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $838 million. (b) As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $505 million under letter of credit facilities with terms that extend from June 2013 to June 2015. As of December 31, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under these letter of credit facilities and we had $3 million of unused or available credit capacity. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,469 $ 2,275 $ 2,362 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,185 ) $ (1,606 ) $ (1,250 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (566 ) $ (1,273 ) $ (457 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2011 as compared with 2010 are summarized below: Ÿ Decreased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits, was approximately $242 million lower in 2011 due in large part to the extension of the bonus depreciation legislation. The ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our full year 2011 cash taxes by approximately $175 million. Also contributing to the decrease in cash paid for taxes in 2011, is an increase in federal tax credits provided by our investments in two unconsolidated entities. These investments are discussed in Note 9 and Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ÿ 2010 Non-recurring cash inflows — Two significant cash transactions benefited cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, we received $77 million for a litigation settlement, and in the third quarter of 2010, we received a $65 million federal tax refund related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. Ÿ Settlement of Canadian hedge — In December 2010, our previously existing foreign currency hedges matured and we paid cash of $37 million upon settlement. The cash payment from the settlement was classified as a change in accrued liabilities within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted in 2011 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in 59 Table of Contents accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Ÿ Increase in earnings — Our income from operations increased by $229 million on a year-over-year basis, driven, in part, by a favorable cash benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in April 2010. This earnings increase was also impacted by (i) the recognition of a $51 million non-cash charge associated with the abandonment of licensed revenue management software and (ii) the recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in 2009 as a result of a change in expectations for the future operations of an inactive landfill in California. The comparison of our 2010 and 2009 income from operations was also affected by a $91 million increase in non-cash charges attributable to (i) equity-based compensation expense; (ii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities; (iii) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets; (iv) depreciation and amortization; and (v) the impact of the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer pension plans. While these increases in non-cash charges unfavorably affected our earnings comparison, there was no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was negatively impacted in 2010 and favorably impacted in 2009, by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Additionally, the following are other significant items that affected our cash flow from operations: Ÿ Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $86 million higher on a year-over-year basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed in the Provision for income taxes section above. Ÿ Increased interest payments — Cash paid for interest was approximately $61 million higher on a year-over-year basis. This increase was primarily due to (i) the issuance of an additional $600 million of senior notes in November 2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010; (ii) significantly higher costs related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility, which was refinanced in June 2010; and (iii) a decrease in benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding. Ÿ Settlement of Canadian hedge — In December 2010, our previously existing foreign currency hedges matured and we paid cash of $37 million upon settlement. The cash payment from the settlement was classified as a change in accrued liabilities within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Liquidation of a foreign subsidiary — We received a $65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. The cash proceeds were classified as a change in other current assets within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Capital expenditures — We used $1,324 million during 2011 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,104 million in 2010 and $1,179 million in 2009. The increase in capital expenditures in 2011 is a result of our increased spending on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as our taking advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation. The year-over-year comparison of 2011 with 2010 was also affected by timing differences associated 60 Table of Contents with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. Approximately $206 million of our fourth quarter 2010 spending was paid in cash in the first quarter of 2011 compared with approximately $145 million of our fourth quarter 2009 spending that was paid in the first quarter of 2010. Ÿ Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions increased from $281 million during 2009 to $407 million in 2010 and to $867 million in 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf, which provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of third-party haulers. During the second quarter of 2010, we paid approximately $150 million to acquire a waste-to-energy facility in Portsmouth, Virginia. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. Ÿ Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $155 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2011. These investments included a $48 million payment made to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company, which was established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility in North Dakota, and $107 million of investments primarily related to furthering our goal of growing into new markets by investing in greener technologies. We made $173 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2010. These cash investments were primarily related to a $142 million payment made to acquire a 40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, a subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd. As a joint venture partner in SEG, we participate in the operation and management of waste-to-energy and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG’s focus also includes building new waste-to-energy facilities in China. Ÿ Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $107 million to our investing activities in 2011 compared with $48 million in 2010 and $196 million in 2009. The significant decrease in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2010 was due to a decrease in tax-exempt borrowings. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Share repurchases and dividend payments — Our 2011, 2010 and 2009 share repurchases and dividend payments have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $575 million for share repurchases in 2011, compared with $501 million in 2010 and $226 million in 2009. We repurchased approximately 17 million, 15 million and 7 million shares of our common stock in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We did not repurchase shares during the first half of 2009 given the state of the economy and the financial markets. In the second half of 2009, we resumed repurchases of our common stock following improvements in the economy and capital markets. We paid an aggregate of $637 million in cash dividends during 2011, compared with $604 million in 2010 and $569 million in 2009. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.29 in 2009, to $0.315 in 2010 and to $0.34 in 2011, and has been offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. In December 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from $0.34 to $0.355 for dividends declared in 2012. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In December 2011, the Board of Directors approved up to $500 million in share repurchases for 2012. However, future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. 61 Table of Contents Ÿ Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $45 million of financing cash inflows during 2011 compared with $54 million during 2010 and $20 million during 2009. Ÿ Net debt repayments — Net debt borrowings were $698 million in 2011, net debt repayments were $204 million in 2010 and net debt borrowings were $414 million in 2009. The following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility(a) $ 150 $ — $ — Canadian credit facility 137 316 364 Senior notes 893 592 1,385 Capital leases and other 21 — — $ 1,201 $ 908 $ 1,749 Repayments: Revolving credit facility(a) $ — $ — $ (310 ) Canadian credit facility (214 ) (372 ) (395 ) Senior notes (147 ) (600 ) (500 ) Tax exempt bonds (25 ) (52 ) (65 ) Tax exempt project bonds (30 ) (39 ) (39 ) Capital leases and other debt (87 ) (49 ) (26 ) $ (503 ) $ (1,112 ) $ (1,335 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ 698 $ (204 ) $ 414 (a) Due to the short-term maturities of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility, we have reported these cash flows on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and debt repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009, these non-cash financing activities were primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings. Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal repayments made directly from trust funds, were $100 million and $105 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not have any tax-exempt bond financings; however, we did have a $215 million non-cash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. This investment is discussed in detail in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ÿ Other — Net cash used in other financing activities was $46 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2009 while net cash provided from other financing activities was $18 million in 2010. These activities are primarily attributable to changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances due to the timing of cash deposits or payments. During 2011, the cash used for these activities included $7 million of financing costs paid in May to amend and restate our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The cash provided by changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances in 2010 was offset, in part, by $13 million of financing costs paid in June to initially execute our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. 62 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 123 $ 98 $ 86 $ 114 $ 95 $ 1,993 $ 2,509 Environmental remediation 38 26 27 24 12 138 265 161 124 113 138 107 2,131 2,774 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 918 210 460 455 696 6,924 9,663 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 91 77 68 56 45 238 575 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 148 143 47 36 29 237 640 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2011 $ 1,318 $ 554 $ 688 $ 685 $ 877 $ 9,530 $ 13,652 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011 include $305 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 63 Table of Contents Liquidity Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions As discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2011 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2011, over 17% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Measurements — In May 2011, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements. This amended guidance defines certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements were effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and are to be applied prospectively. We do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2011, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2011, we had $9.7 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $2.2 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2012. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $1 billion of “receive fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixed-rate senior notes; (ii) $611 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to re-pricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (iii) $305 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within twelve months; (iv) $150 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility; and 64 Table of Contents (v) U.S.$137 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2012 interest expense by approximately $18 million. As of December 31, 2010, the effective interest rates of approximately $1.8 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. In addition, at December 31, 2011, we had forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $375 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $805 million at December 31, 2011. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. With the exception of electricity commodity derivatives, which are discussed below, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended December 31, 2011. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. During 2011, approximately 54% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently expect that nearly 56% of our electricity revenues at our waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2012. Our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as long-term power purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium- and long-term electricity contracts. As we renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our waste-to-energy facilities will be based on variable market rates. Accordingly, in 2010 we implemented a more actively managed energy program, which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada and investments in China and the United Kingdom. From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives. The foreign currency exposure associated with our investments in China and the United Kingdom has not been material. 65 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:58.615714
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2012. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our Company is dedicated to three transformational goals that we believe will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry: know more about our customers and how to service them than anyone else; use conversion and processing technology to extract more value from the materials we manage; and continuously improve our operational efficiency. Our strategy supports diversion from landfills and converting waste into valuable products as customers seek more economically and environmentally sound alternatives. We intend to pursue achievement of our long-term goals in the short-term through efforts to: Ÿ Grow our markets by implementing customer-focused growth, through customer segmentation and through strategic acquisitions, while maintaining our pricing discipline and increasing the amount of recyclable materials we manage each year; Ÿ Grow our customer loyalty; Ÿ Grow into new markets by investing in greener technologies; and Ÿ Pursue initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure. These efforts will be supported by ongoing improvements in information technologies. We believe that execution of our strategy will provide long-term value to our stockholders. Highlights of our financial results for 2012 include: Ÿ Revenues of $13.6 billion compared with $13.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $271 million, or 2.0%. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to: Ÿ Increases associated with acquired businesses of $535 million, of which $314 million is related to Oakleaf; Ÿ Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal business of 0.8% in the current year, which increased revenue by $86 million; Ÿ Year-over-year increase in internal revenue growth from volume of $67 million, primarily from our recycling brokerage business and our material recovery facilities. Additionally, revenues increased due to higher special waste volumes; and Ÿ Increases from fuel surcharges and mandated fees of $33 million; Ÿ Offset in large part by decreases from lower recyclable commodity prices, lower electricity prices and foreign currency translation totaling $446 million; Ÿ Operating expenses of $8.9 billion, or 65.1% of revenues, compared with $8.5 billion, or 63.8% of revenues, in 2011. This increase of $338 million is due in large part to our acquisition of Oakleaf, and related increases in subcontractor costs, as well as the impact of higher fuel prices on direct and indirect fuel costs, which have related revenue increases as noted above. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in customer rebates because of lower recyclable commodity prices; Ÿ Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $79 million, or 5.1%, from $1,551 million in 2011 to $1,472 million in 2012, primarily due to reductions in incentive compensation and long-term incentive plan expenses and a decrease in consulting costs due to the implementation of our initiatives focusing on procurement and operational and back-office efficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by increases to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and expand service offerings, including the acquisition of Oakleaf; 31 Table of Contents Ÿ Income from operations of $1.9 billion, or 13.6% of revenues, in 2012 compared with $2.0 billion, or 15.2% of revenues, in 2011; Ÿ Net income of $817 million, or $1.76 per diluted share for 2012, as compared with $961 million, or $2.04 per diluted share in 2011; and Ÿ We returned $658 million to our shareholders through dividends in 2012, compared with $637 million in 2011. The following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2012 results with 2011 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2012 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $109 million attributable primarily to facilities in our medical waste services business and investments in waste diversion technologies. These items had a negative impact of $0.17 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax restructuring costs aggregating $82 million primarily related to our July 2012 restructuring as well as integration costs associated with our acquisition of Oakleaf. These items had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $10 million related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and a pre-tax charge of $6 million resulting from a labor union dispute. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $10 million related to an accrual for legal reserves and the impact of a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our environmental remediation liabilities. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share. The following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2011 results with 2010 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2011 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $24 million as a result of a litigation loss, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges, excluding charges recognized in the operating results of Oakleaf, of $17 million related to our cost savings programs. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs and had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $11 million related to the Oakleaf acquisition, which includes the operating results of Oakleaf and related interest expense and integration costs. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a favorable pre-tax benefit of $9 million from a revision to an environmental remediation liability at a closed landfill, which had a positive impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of non-cash, pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9 million primarily related to two of our medical waste services facilities. The impairment charges had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of a tax benefit of $19 million due to favorable tax audit settlements and favorable adjustments relating to the finalization of our 2010 tax returns. These items had a positive impact of $0.04 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2010 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $55 million related to remediation and closure costs at five closed sites, which had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; 32 Table of Contents Ÿ The recognition of net tax charges of $32 million due to refinements in estimates of our deferred state income taxes and the finalization of our 2009 tax returns, partially offset by favorable tax audit settlements, all of which, combined, had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a net favorable pre-tax benefit of $46 million for litigation and associated costs, which had a favorable impact of $0.06 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of net pre-tax charges of $26 million as a result of the withdrawal of certain of our union bargaining units from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. During 2012, we continued to produce strong cash flows from operating activities and return cash to our shareholders through dividends, despite very challenging commodity market conditions. Our fourth quarter 2012 results were in line with our expectations, and our internal revenue growth from yield was at its highest level for the year, positioning the Company to focus on growing earnings. In 2013, we expect to see increased internal revenue growth from yield and volume, as well as continued benefit from our cost savings programs, including our 2012 restructuring. We will also continue to emphasize strong cash flow to support our dividend, debt reduction, share repurchases, and appropriate acquisition and investment opportunities. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,295 $ 2,469 $ 2,275 Capital expenditures (1,510 ) (1,324 ) (1,104 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets (a) 44 53 44 Free cash flow $ 829 $ 1,198 $ 1,215 (a) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the receipt of a payment of $17 million related to a note receivable from a prior year divestiture. This receipt is included as a component of “Other” within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 to the comparable period in 2011, the decrease was primarily related to the impact of lower cash earnings, an increase in tax payments of $63 million year-over-year, the payment of $59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in September 2012 and unfavorable impacts of working capital changes. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable cash receipt of $72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in April 2012. 33 Table of Contents When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 to the comparable period in 2010, the change is primarily attributable to decreases in our income tax payments, which positively affected our cash flow from operations, as well as a cash payment of $37 million made when our Canadian hedges matured in December 2010. This increase was partially offset by a favorable cash benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in April 2010 and a $65 million federal tax refund in the third quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. The increase in capital expenditures is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure and growth initiatives, and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. We generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year. A more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 spending was paid in cash in 2012 and 2011, respectively, than in the preceding year. Acquisition of Oakleaf Global Holdings On July 28, 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf. Oakleaf provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of third-party haulers. The operations we acquired generated approximately $580 million in revenues in 2010. We acquired Oakleaf to advance our growth and transformation strategies and increase our national accounts customer base while enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $1 million of acquisition-related costs, which were classified as “Selling, general and administrative” expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2011, subsequent to the acquisition date, Oakleaf recognized revenues of $265 million and net income of less than $1 million, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, Oakleaf recognized revenues of $617 million and net losses of $29 million, which are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following table shows adjustments since September 30, 2011 to the allocation of the purchase price of Oakleaf to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value; this allocation was finalized as of September 30, 2012 (in millions): September 30, 2011 Adjustments September 30, 2012 Accounts and other receivables $ 68 $ 3 $ 71 Other current assets 28 — 28 Property and equipment 77 (7 ) 70 Goodwill 320 8 328 Other intangible assets 92 (5 ) 87 Accounts payable (80 ) (2 ) (82 ) Accrued liabilities (48 ) — (48 ) Deferred income taxes, net (13 ) 4 (9 ) Other liabilities (12 ) (1 ) (13 ) Total purchase price $ 432 $ — $ 432 The following table presents the final allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets (amounts in millions, except for amortization periods): Amount Weighted AverageAmortizationPeriods (in Years) Customer relationships $ 74 10.0 Vendor relationships 4 10.0 Trademarks 9 15.0 $ 87 10.5 34 Table of Contents Goodwill of $328 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is a result of expected synergies from combining the Company’s operations with Oakleaf’s national accounts customer base and vendor network. The vendor-hauler network expands our partnership with third-party service providers. In many cases we can provide vendor-haulers with opportunities to maintain and increase their business by utilizing our extensive post-collection network. We believe this will generate significant benefits for the Company and for the vendor-haulers. Goodwill has been assigned to our Areas as they are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. The following pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of Oakleaf occurred at January 1, 2010 (in millions, except per share amounts): Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Operating revenues $ 13,693 $ 13,059 Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. 955 935 Basic earnings per common share 2.03 1.95 Diluted earnings per common share 2.03 1.94 Subsequent Event In January 2013, we acquired Greenstar, LLC, an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. We paid cash consideration of $170 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, up to an additional $40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018 should Greenstar, LLC satisfy certain performance criteria over this period. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing — In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. The amendments are effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Comprehensive Income — In June 2011, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income were effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and have been applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurement — In May 2011, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements. This amended guidance defines certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with GAAP. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements were effective for the Company on January 1, 35 Table of Contents 2012 and have been applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing — In September 2011, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with goodwill impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two-step impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendments are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2011 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — In October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement are required to be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and, is therefore, required to consolidate the entity. This new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that can most significantly impact the entity’s performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could be significant from the perspective of the entity. The new guidance also requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events. As a result of our implementation of this guidance, effective January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts because we share power over significant activities of these trusts with others. Our financial interests in these entities are discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The deconsolidation of these trusts has not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: Ÿ Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; Ÿ It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; 37 Table of Contents Ÿ We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; Ÿ There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Ÿ Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Ÿ Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval of our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 32 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2012, 10 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Six of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining four landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. 38 Table of Contents Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Ÿ Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; Ÿ Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; Ÿ The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and Ÿ The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below. Landfills — The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill 39 Table of Contents to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. At December 31, 2012, three of our landfill sites in two jurisdictions, for which we believe receipt of expansion permits is probable, are not currently accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for these three sites was $493 million at December 31, 2012. We performed tests of recoverability for these landfills and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of these three sites. Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill for impairment. In July 2012, we announced organizational changes including removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste business from 22 to 17. With the elimination of the geographic Groups, we have determined that our Areas constitute reporting units and we now assess whether a goodwill impairment exists at the Area level. Goodwill previously assigned to the Groups was allocated to the Areas on a relative fair value basis. This reorganization did not change our other reporting units, including the Wheelabrator business and our other less material reporting units including recycling brokerage and waste diversion technology businesses. We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment or two-step impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units. In the second quarter of 2012, we believed an impairment indicator existed such that the fair value of our Wheelabrator business could potentially be less than its carrying amount because of the negative effect on our revenues of the continued deterioration of electricity commodity prices, coupled with our continued increased exposure to market prices as a result of the expiration of several long-term, fixed-rate electricity commodity 40 Table of Contents contracts at our waste-to-energy and independent power facilities, and the expiration of several long-term disposal contracts at above-market rates. As a result, we performed an interim impairment analysis of Wheelabrator’s goodwill balance, of $788 million. We performed the interim quantitative assessment using both an income and a market approach in the second quarter of 2012, which indicated that the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances using a measurement date of October 1, 2012. This impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10% compared to an excess of 30% at our annual fourth quarter 2011 test. This quantitative assessment was performed using both an income and market approach similar to our interim quantitative assessment. If market prices for electricity worsen or do not recover as we have projected, our disposal volumes or rates decline, our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts or our costs of capital increase, the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period. We will continue to monitor our Wheelabrator business. Our annual goodwill impairment test also indicated that the estimated fair value of our Eastern Canada Area exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. This quantitative assessment also was performed using both an income and market approach. The Eastern Canada Area goodwill balance was $295 million at October 1, 2012. If we do not achieve our anticipated disposal volumes, our collection or disposal rates decline, our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts, costs of capital increase, or we do not receive anticipated landfill expansions, the estimated fair value of our Eastern Canada Area could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period. We will continue to monitor our Eastern Canada Area. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported periods. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. Beginning in 2012, when performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment considerations made during the reported periods. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available 41 Table of Contents evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel. Our waste-to-energy revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator business, are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam. Our “Other” lines of business include Oakleaf, our landfill gas-to-energy operations, Port-O-Let® services, portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below.

The year-over-year change in revenues for both periods has been driven by (i) revenue growth from average yield on our collection and disposal operations; (ii) acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Oakleaf, which increased year-over-year consolidated revenues by $314 million for 2012 and $251 million for 2011; and (iii) market factors, including fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices that negatively affected revenues in 2012 and favorably affected our revenues in 2011; volatility in diesel prices that affects the revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program; foreign currency translation, which negatively affected our revenues from our Canadian operations in 2012 but favorably impacted our revenues in 2011; and lower electricity prices, which correlate with natural gas prices and cause fluctuations in the rates we receive for electricity under our power purchase contracts and merchant transactions. Further affecting revenue changes were revenue increases due to higher volumes in 2012 but revenues declines due to lower volumes in 2011. 44 Table of Contents The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. In 2012, revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $86 million, or 0.8%, as compared with the prior year. This revenue increase from yield was primarily driven by our collection operations; however, we also experienced yield growth from our disposal operations. Our commercial and industrial lines of business continue to drive our yield growth in our collection operations. Our 0.8% increase for 2012 is less than the 1.8% increase for 2011. This is due in large part to reduced increases of certain service fees and continued pressure from competition in our commercial line of business. Additionally, we have experienced downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield in our residential line of business. Due to competition, it has become increasingly difficult to retain customers and to win new contracts at current average rates; as a result, in many instances, the Company has offered increased services without a commensurate increase in pricing when bidding on or renewing residential contracts and pursuing residential subscription business. These increased services are principally recycling services, which are typically priced lower than our average rates. This combination of increased competition and bundling of complementary services, such as recycling, in the residential line of business has put added pressure on our revenue growth from yield though we did see a steadily improving trend throughout 2012. In both 2012 and 2011, our total collection and disposal revenue growth from yield was negatively affected by the expiration and renegotiation of a long-term disposal contract in August 2011 at one of our waste-to-energy facilities in South Florida. The expiration and renegotiation of this contract decreased revenues both in our waste-to-energy disposal line of business, by approximately $17 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and in our collection line of business, by approximately $7 million and $2 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Certain of the franchise agreements serviced by our collection operations in South Florida contain specific language that ties a portion of their total rate to the disposal rate charged by this waste-to-energy facility to our collection operations. The expiration of this long-term contract in South Florida negatively impacted our total collection and disposal yield by approximately $24 million and $7 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Additionally, for 2012, we experienced further downward pressure on our revenue growth from yield of approximately $7 million resulting from the expiration and renegotiation of a second similar long-term waste-to-energy disposal contract in South Florida at the end of March 2012. We expect this negative trend to continue into 2013. Although the factors discussed above negatively affected our revenue growth from yield in 2012 as compared with 2011, we did see a favorable rate of revenue growth from yield in our landfill line of business during 2012. Overall, we have found that increasing our revenue growth from yield is currently a challenge given the increased service offerings in many of our new contracts and the highly competitive environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in order to improve yield on our base business. Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in average yield on collection and disposal, increased by $41 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Environmental fee revenues totaled $344 million in 2012 as compared with $303 million in 2011 and $256 million in 2010. Revenue increase from environmental fees flattened, as we did not implement fee increases in 2012 commensurate with the prior year. During 2013, we are not expecting our environmental fee to contribute significantly to our revenue growth. Recycling commodities — Decreases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sold resulted in a decrease in revenues of $428 million, with an estimated negative impact on income from operations of approximately $130 million for 2012. Our year-over-year commodity prices declined almost 25% in 2012 driven 45 Table of Contents by the continued increase in supply and lower demand. In 2011, higher recycling commodity prices were the principal driver of our revenue increase of $216 million as compared with 2010, with an estimated favorable impact on income from operations of approximately $60 million. In 2013, we expect recycling commodity sales prices to average levels present at the end of 2012 and be slightly negative in the first half of the year compared to 2012. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, increased by $33 million and $169 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These increases are attributable to the fluctuation in the national average prices for diesel fuel that we use for our fuel surcharge program. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations, which increased $11 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Volume — Changes in our volume caused our revenue to increase $67 million, or 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2012. This is a notable improvement from the prior year when revenue decline due to volume was $187 million, or 1.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2012, our total landfill revenue increased $49 million over the comparable prior year period due to higher third-party volumes, primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in the eastern and mid-western parts of the country. In addition, revenues increased from year-over-year volume growth in our recycling brokerage business and our material recovery facilities by $61 million for 2012. The additional recycling capacity that we added during 2011 and 2012, as well as our continued pursuit of municipal volumes, contributed to this increase in revenues due to volume. Volume declines from our collection business accounted for a $65 million revenue decline for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decline was primarily driven by our commercial and, to a lesser extent, our residential collection lines of business, which we attribute to the effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by customers, as well as the overall continued weakness in the economy. Revenue declines due to lower volumes in these two collection lines of business were offset, in part, by revenue increases in our industrial collection line of business, driven in large part by the growth of our oilfield services business. Furthermore, revenue increased due to volume growth in our non-traditional collection businesses, as well as in our ancillary services, primarily driven by increases in our medical waste services, our in-plant services and our portable self-storage services businesses. Finally, our 2012 volume growth was favorably impacted by the Hurricane Sandy cleanup efforts in the fourth quarter by about $26 million. In 2011, volume declines from our collection business accounted for $327 million of volume-related revenue decline. We experienced commercial and residential collection revenue declines due to lower volume that we attributed to the overall weakness in the economy, as well as the effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by consumers. Our industrial collection operations were negatively affected by the economic environment due to the construction slowdown across the United States. Lower third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines generally attributed to economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition. Furthermore, the overall year-over-year comparison of volumes in the collection line of business was unfavorably impacted by our year-over-year volume change of $94 million from the oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast in 2010. Additionally, in 2011, we experienced revenue declines at our waste-to-energy facilities, primarily driven by the expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement, which was offset to some extent by increases in waste tons processed and electricity produced. Revenue declines due to volume detailed above were offset, in part, by revenue increases of $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily from year-over-year volume improvements in our recycling brokerage business and in our material recovery facilities. Our continued pursuit of municipal volumes as well as the addition of new single stream recycling facilities during 2011 contributed to these revenue increases due to volume. We also experienced volume-related revenue increases of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from our strategic growth businesses and our landfill gas-to-energy operations. Additionally, our total landfill revenues increased $41 million in 2011 due to higher third-party volumes as compared with the prior 46 Table of Contents year, primarily driven by higher special waste volumes in the eastern and mid-western parts of the country. However, our landfill municipal solid waste volumes declined in 2011 as compared with the prior year due to economic conditions, increased pricing, competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. Acquisitions — Revenues increased $535 million and $449 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to acquisitions. Both in 2012 and 2011, the significant revenue increase due to acquisitions was principally associated with Oakleaf, included in our “Other” business. With the anniversary of the Oakleaf acquisition in July 2012, we will not continue to experience the same year-over-year revenue growth from this acquisition. Additionally, in 2012, acquisitions increased our revenues in our collection line of business, due in part to our oilfield services and recycling lines of business. These acquisitions demonstrate our focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new, complementary lines of business. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses increased $338 million, or 4.0%, when comparing 2012 with 2011 and increased $717 million, or 9.2%, when comparing 2011 with 2010. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 65.1% in 2012, 63.8% in 2011 and 62.5% in 2010. The increases in our operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 can largely be attributed to the following: Acquisitions and growth initiatives — In both 2012 and 2011, we experienced cost increases attributable to recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business development initiatives. We estimate that these cost increases, which affected each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below, accounted for 109% and 42% of our $338 million and $717 million increases in operating expenses during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Recent acquisitions include Oakleaf and a number of collection operations, including oilfield services, and several recycling operations. In particular, the acquisition of Oakleaf increased operating costs by $263 million and $213 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily impacting subcontractor costs and, to a lesser extent, cost of goods sold, repair and maintenance, and other categories. The increase in operating expenses resulting from acquired businesses was more than offset by increased revenues from acquired businesses. Market prices for recyclable commodities — In both 2012 and 2011, volatile market prices for recyclable commodities was the main driver of the changes in cost of goods sold, as presented in the table below, primarily due to customer recycling rebates. Overall market prices for recycling commodities decreased by approximately 25% in 2012 and increased 20% in 2011. Volume changes — During 2012, we experienced an increase in variable costs attributable to higher volumes in certain lines of business, particularly our recycling, industrial collection and non-traditional collection businesses. In our non-traditional collection businesses, we experienced volume increases primarily in our in-plant services. Additionally, increased volumes related to Hurricane Sandy contributed to 47 Table of Contents higher volumes in the latter part of 2012. During 2011, we experienced volume declines as a result of the ongoing weakness of the overall economic environment, pricing, competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. We continue to manage our fixed costs and control our variable costs as we experience volume increases and decreases. These cost fluctuations due to volume have impacted each of the operating cost categories identified in the table below. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Labor and related benefits $ 2,407 $ 71 3.0 % $ 2,336 $ 36 1.6 % $ 2,300 Transfer and disposal costs 964 27 2.9 937 (6 ) (0.6 ) 943 Maintenance and repairs 1,157 67 6.1 1,090 49 4.7 1,041 Subcontractor costs 1,190 242 25.5 948 178 23.1 770 Cost of goods sold 919 (152 ) (14.2 ) 1,071 295 38.0 776 Fuel 649 21 3.3 628 135 27.4 493 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 630 28 4.7 602 13 2.2 589 Landfill operating costs 224 (31 ) (12.2 ) 255 (39 ) (13.3 ) 294 Risk management 230 8 3.6 222 20 9.9 202 Other 509 57 12.6 452 36 8.7 416 $ 8,879 $ 338 4.0 % $ 8,541 $ 717 9.2 % $ 7,824 In addition to the significant items noted above, other factors contributing to the changes in our operating expenses are discussed below: Labor and related benefits — The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for the periods presented has been affected by costs incurred primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. These costs increased 2012 expense by $10 million and 2010 expense by $26 million. The other contributing factors that increased costs in 2012 and 2011 were (i) higher hourly and salaried wages due to merit increases effective April 2011 and 2010 and (ii) increases stipulated in labor union agreements. These costs were offset by lower incentive compensation in 2012. Maintenance and repairs — The increase was primarily due to (i) increased fleet maintenance costs, which include services provided by third-parties, tires, parts and internal shop labor costs; and (ii) differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities. Subcontractor costs — As noted above, the increases in 2012 and 2011 in subcontractor costs was primarily a result of acquisitions; principally the Oakleaf acquisition. Other contributing factors include; (i) our various growth and business development initiatives, primarily associated with servicing our in-plant services and healthcare solutions customers, (ii) higher fuel prices, as discussed below, which resulted in an increase in the fuel component of our subcontractor costs; and (iii) increased volumes related to Hurricane Sandy during 2012. The comparability to prior years was also affected by $54 million in costs related to oil spill clean up activities in 2010. Fuel — On average, diesel fuel prices increased 3% and 29% for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Higher fuel costs resulted in increases in both our direct fuel costs and in the fuel component of our subcontractor costs as compared with the prior periods. Increased revenues attributable to our fuel surcharge largely offset the higher fuel costs. Our fuel surcharges covered approximately 95% of recoverable fuel costs in both 2012 and 2011. 48 Table of Contents Landfill Operating Costs — The year-over-year decreases in 2012 and 2011 were primarily attributable to the following: Ÿ The recognition of an unfavorable adjustment of $17 million during 2011 due to a decrease from 3.50% to 2.00% in United States Treasury rates used as the discount rate to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets; and Ÿ Additional landfill site costs experienced along the East Coast during 2011, which were due to significant rainfall events, including the effects from spring flooding and Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee partially offset by Ÿ The 2011 recognition of a $9 million favorable revision to an environmental liability at a closed site based on the estimated cost of the remediation as prescribed by the EPA; and Ÿ The 2010 recognition of $50 million in additional environmental expenses related to four closed sites. Other — The comparability of our other costs for the periods presented has been affected by (i) 2012 costs associated with a labor union dispute in the Seattle Area; (ii) increased oil and gas development expense in 2012; and (iii) oil spill clean-up activities along the Gulf Coast in 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $79 million, or 5.1%, and increased $90 million, or 6.2% when comparing 2012 with 2011 and 2011 with 2010, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.8% in 2012, 11.6% in 2011 and 11.7% in 2010. The most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative costs during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 are summarized below: Ÿ A decrease in incentive compensation, included in labor and related benefits below, of $73 million in 2012; Ÿ A decrease in non-cash compensation expense, included in labor and related benefits below, attributable to our long-term incentive plan, or LTIP, of $15 million in 2012 and an increase of $10 million in 2011; Ÿ Consulting costs, included in professional fees below, of $37 million in 2011 during the start-up phase of our Company-wide initiatives focusing on procurement and operational and back-office efficiency. During 2012, these consulting costs decreased $26 million as we completed the start-up phase early in the year; however, this was partially offset by approximately $10 million of additional costs associated with our efforts to implement these initiatives; and Ÿ An increase in costs, primarily labor, of approximately $34 million and $53 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings, including our integration of Oakleaf. In addition, in July 2012, we announced a reorganization of our operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. We have implemented the reorganization and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, we realized labor and related benefits cost savings of $20 million. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2012 Period-to-Period Change 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Labor and related benefits $ 850 $ (63 ) (6.9 )% $ 913 $ 68 8.0 % $ 845 Professional fees 163 (22 ) (11.9 ) 185 10 5.7 175 Provision for bad debts 60 13 27.7 47 2 4.4 45 Other 399 (7 ) (1.7 ) 406 10 2.5 396 $ 1,472 $ (79 ) (5.1 )% $ 1,551 $ 90 6.2 % $ 1,461 Other significant changes in our selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed below: Ÿ Labor and related benefits — In 2011, our labor and related benefits costs increased primarily due to higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit increases. Ÿ Professional fees — In 2011, we experienced a reduction in legal fees primarily as a result of the settlement in 2010 of a lawsuit related to the abandonment of revenue management software. Ÿ Provision for bad debts — Our provision for bad debts increased in 2012, primarily as a result of (i) collection issues we are experiencing in our Puerto Rico operations and (ii) billing delays to some of our strategic account customers. Ÿ Other — In 2012, we experienced decreases in (i) litigation settlement costs and (ii) insurance and claims. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (i) computer and telecommunications costs, due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems; and (ii) building and equipment costs, which include rental and utilities. In 2011, we experienced similar increases in our computer costs, as well as increases in litigation loss and settlement costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 833 $ 33 4.1 % $ 800 $ 19 2.4 % $ 781 Amortization of landfill airspace 395 17 4.5 378 6 1.6 372 Amortization of intangible assets 69 18 35.3 51 10 24.4 41 $ 1,297 $ 68 5.5 % $ 1,229 $ 35 2.9 % $ 1,194 50 Table of Contents The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2012 and 2011 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of Oakleaf and by our Areas located in the Northern U.S. Restructuring 2012 Restructurings — In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. Principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including positions at both the management and support level. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many in management. Additionally, in 2012, we recognized employee severance and benefits restructuring charges associated with the reorganization of Oakleaf discussed below that began in 2011 along with certain other actions taken by the Company in early 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a total of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $56 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. We do not expect additional charges related to the 2012 restructurings to be material. 2011 Restructurings — Beginning in July 2011, we took steps to streamline our organization as part of our cost savings programs. This reorganization eliminated over 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including approximately 300 open positions. Additionally, subsequent to our acquisition of Oakleaf, we incurred charges in connection with restructuring that organization. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a total of $19 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $18 million were related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. Through December 31, 2012, we have paid approximately $46 million of the employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the combined 2012 and 2011 restructuring efforts. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (Income) expense from divestitures $ — $ 1 $ (1 ) Asset impairments 83 9 — Other — — (77 ) $ 83 $ 10 $ (78 ) Asset Impairments — During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $83 million, attributable in large part to $45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities. We wrote down the carrying values of the facilities’ operating permits and property, plant and equipment to their estimated fair values. Our medical waste services business is included in our “Other” operations in Note 21. We also recognized (i) $20 million of charges related to investments we had made in prior years in waste diversion technologies; (ii) $6 million for the impairment of an oil & gas well due to projected operating losses; (iii) $5 million for the impairment of a facility not currently used in our operations and (iv) $4 million of charges to impair goodwill related to certain of our operations. To determine the appropriate charge for each of these items, we estimated the fair value of the facilities or investments using anticipated future cash flows. These charges are included in our “Other” operations in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized impairment charges relating to two facilities in our medical waste services business, in addition to the three facilities impaired in 2012 and discussed above, as a result of the closure of one site and as a result of continuing operating losses at the other site. We wrote down the net book values of the sites to their estimated fair values. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of underperforming assets or assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives. Accordingly, it is possible that additional impairments may be recorded as assets are sold or become held-for-sale. Other — We filed a lawsuit in March 2008 related to the revenue management software implementation that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009. In April 2010, we settled the lawsuit and received a one-time cash payment. The settlement increased our “Income from operations” for the year ended December 31, 2010 by $77 million. Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Period-to-PeriodChange 2010 Solid Waste $ 2,625 $ 17 0.7 % $ 2,608 $ 113 4.5 % $ 2,495 Wheelabrator 113 (59 ) (34.3 ) 172 (38 ) (18.1 ) 210 Other (242 ) (78 ) 47.6 (164 ) (7 ) 4.5 (157 ) Corporate and other (645 ) (57 ) 9.7 (588 ) (156 ) 36.1 (432 ) Total $ 1,851 $ (177 ) (8.7 )% $ 2,028 $ (88 ) (4.2 )% $ 2,116 Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three year period ended December 31, 2012 are summarized below: Ÿ revenue growth from yield on our base business; Ÿ earnings associated with revenue changes due to volumes declined during 2011 due to the economy, pricing, competition and increased focus on waste reduction and diversion by consumers. Additionally, 2011 volume comparisons with 2010 were unfavorably affected by the 2010 oil spill clean up in the Gulf Coast. For 2012, although volumes decreased in our collection lines of business, there was a slight increase in total volumes attributed in part to (i) an improvement in landfill special waste volumes experienced principally in the eastern and midwestern parts of the country; and (ii) volumes from the Hurricane Sandy cleanup efforts. In addition, our results benefited from the growth of our oilfield services business. These services, which focus principally on the hauling and disposal of drill cuttings and fluids and various well pad services, favorably affected both our landfill and collection lines of business; Ÿ the accretive benefits of recent acquisitions; Ÿ market price declines for recyclable commodities during 2012 when compared with 2011, negatively affecting our income from operations. During 2011, income from operations benefited from substantial increases in market prices; Ÿ restructuring charges recognized during both 2012 and 2011; Ÿ higher operating costs, including maintenance and repair costs in 2012 and 2011 and transfer and disposal costs in 2012; Ÿ benefits realized as a result of our restructuring activities; Ÿ During 2012 and 2011, employees were transferred from Solid Waste to Corporate, favorably impacting income from operations; however, during 2011, annual merit increases for remaining employees more than offset the effect of the transferred employees; and Ÿ decreased incentive compensation expense during 2012. 52 Table of Contents Other items affecting the reported periods include: 2012 Ÿ a charge of $10 million for the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan; Ÿ $6 million of incremental operating expenses due to a labor union dispute in the Seattle Area; Ÿ a charge of $5 million for a write-down of idle property to estimated fair value; Ÿ a $5 million increase in bad debt expense due to collection issues in Puerto Rico; 2011 Ÿ a charge of $24 million as a result of a litigation loss; Ÿ higher landfill costs of approximately $14 million for the collection and disposal of leachate, which was largely the result of heavy rainfall in the Eastern U.S.; 2010 Ÿ a charge of $26 million for the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan; and Ÿ charges of $23 million related to litigation reserves. Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining components of our results of operations for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010 are summarized below: Wheelabrator — The significant decrease in income from operations of our Wheelabrator business for the period ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 was largely driven by (i) lower revenues duee to the expiration of long-term contracts at certain of our waste-to-energy facilities; (ii) lower energy pricing at our merchant facilities; (iii) increased maintenance and repair costs, primarily due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance activities; and (iv) increased international development costs. The decrease in 2011 income from operations as compared with 2010 was driven largely by (i) lower revenues due to the expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement that expired December 31, 2010 and the expiration of other long-term contracts at our waste-to-energy and independent power facilities; and (ii) costs incurred to refurbish a facility acquired in 2010. The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by efforts to control costs across each of our facilities. Other — Our “Other” income from operations include (i) the effects of those elements of our in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy operations, and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Sustainability Services, Organics, Healthcare, Renewable Energy and Strategic Accounts organizations, including Oakleaf, respectively, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services; and (iii) the impacts of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the impacts of (i) non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for the Solid Waste business; and (ii) reclasses to prior year to include the costs of our former geographic Group offices that prior to our 2012 restructuring were included in our operating segments. Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ impairment charges of $77 million recognized during 2012, primarily in (i) our medical waste services business, (ii) investments in waste diversion technologies, and (iii) an oil and gas producing property; Ÿ losses in 2012 and 2011 from our growth initiatives and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Oakleaf; Ÿ restructuring charges recognized during 2012 and 2011; and Ÿ decreased incentive compensation expense during 2012. 53 Table of Contents Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ higher salaries and wages due to the transfer of employees from Solid Waste to Corporate and Other in both 2012 and 2011; Ÿ decreased incentive compensation expense during 2012; Ÿ lower non-cash compensation expense attributable to our LTIP during 2012 and higher expense in 2011; Ÿ restructuring charges recognized during 2012 and 2011; Ÿ benefits realized as a result of our July 2012 restructuring activities; Ÿ 2012 headcount increases due to our sales and marketing initiatives and initiatives focusing on procurement and operational and back-office efficiency; Ÿ higher professional fees in 2011 due to consulting services and related fees incurred associated with the startup phase our above-mentioned Company-wide initiatives; Ÿ a benefit in 2010 of $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement; Ÿ the recognition of a $9 million favorable adjustment during 2011 and net charges of $50 million during 2010 for estimates associated with environmental remediation liabilities at certain of our closed sites; Ÿ changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. As a result of changes in U.S. Treasury rates, we recognized $3 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2012 and $17 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2011; and Ÿ an increase in 2011 risk management costs, primarily due to increased costs associated with auto and general liability claims and the recognition of a favorable adjustment in 2010 associated with similar claims from prior periods. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $488 million in 2012, $481 million in 2011 and $473 million in 2010. During the reported periods, our interest expense has increased only slightly in spite of an increase in our debt balances. This is primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate that has been achieved by refinancing debt at maturity with debt at much lower fixed interest rates; (ii) the impacts that lower market interest rates have had on the cost of certain of our tax-exempt debt; and (iii) an increase in capitalized interest due primarily to higher capital spending. These decreases in interest expense have been partially offset by a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of $46 million in 2012, $31 million in 2011, and $21 million in 2010. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility, as well as (i) noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. Additionally, in 2012, we recognized a charge of $10 million related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method. Other, net We recognized other, net expense of $18 million and $4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and other, net income of $5 million in 2010. The increase in expense during 2012 was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of $16 million relating to an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down the carrying value of our investment to its fair value based on other third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities, which are considered to be the best evidence of fair value currently available. 54 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $443 million in 2012, $511 million in 2011 and $629 million in 2010. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 34.0%, 33.6% and 38.5%, for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards; (iii) changes in effective state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (iv) tax audit settlements; and (v) the impact of federal low-income housing and refined coal tax credits. The impacts of these items are summarized below: Ÿ Federal Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards – During 2012 we recognized additional federal net operating loss carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $8 million. Refer to the discussion below related to the acquisition of Oakleaf for more information with regard to the realization of Oakleaf net operating losses. Ÿ State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards — During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we utilized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes for those periods of $5 million, $4 million, and $4 million, respectively. Ÿ State Tax Rate Changes — During 2011, our state deferred income taxes increased by $3 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized. During 2010, our current state tax rate increased from 6.25% to 6.75% resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of $5 million. In addition, our state deferred income taxes increased $37 million to reflect the impact of changes in the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences will be realized. Ÿ Canadian Tax Rate Changes — During 2012 there was an increase of the provincial tax rates in Ontario which resulted in a $5 million tax expense as a result of the revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. Ÿ Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Ÿ Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credits — Our federal low-income housing investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our federal low-income housing investment. Ÿ Refined Coal Investment Tax Credits — Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal investment. On July 28, 2011, we acquired Oakleaf and its primary operations. As a result of the acquisition, we received income tax attributes (primarily federal and state net operating losses) and allocated a portion of the purchase price to these acquired assets. At the time of the acquisition, we fully recognized all of the tax attributes identified by the seller and concluded the realization of these attributes would not affect our overall provision for income taxes. In the third quarter of 2012, as a result of new information, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $8 million related to additional Oakleaf federal net operating losses received in the acquisition. As this time we do not anticipate the remaining tax attributes, when realized, will affect our overall provision for income taxes. While these attributes are not expected to affect our provision for income taxes, they will have a favorable impact on our cash taxes, although we do not anticipate the impact to be material to our overall cash flow from operations. We expect our 2013 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 35.0% based on expected income levels, projected federal tax credits and other permanent items. 55 Table of Contents The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013 and includes an extension for one year of the 50% bonus depreciation allowance. The provision specifically applies to qualifying property placed in service before January 1, 2014. The acceleration of deductions on 2012 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provision had no impact on our 2012 effective tax rate. However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2012 cash taxes by approximately $90 million. Taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $43 million in 2012, $48 million in 2011 and $49 million in 2010. These amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 264 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2012 and 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Remaining cubic yards 4,778 592 5,370 4,730 621 5,351 Remaining tonnage 4,558 612 5,170 4,485 621 5,106 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2012 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 32 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 56 Table of Contents The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2012, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 10 10 29 67 95 211 Operated through lease(a) 7 2 5 3 7 24 Operating contracts(b) 10 5 7 5 7 34 Total landfills 27 17 41 75 109 269 (a) Landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance, beginning of year 4,485 621 5,106 4,391 603 4,994 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 82 — 82 — — — Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 9 9 — 101 101 Expansion permits granted(b) 40 (40 ) — 84 (84 ) — Airspace consumed (92 ) — (92 ) (90 ) — (90 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 43 22 65 100 1 101 Balance, end of year 4,558 612 5,170 4,485 621 5,106 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at six of our landfills during 2012 and eight of our landfills during 2011, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. 57 Table of Contents The tons received at our landfills in 2012 and 2011 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2012 2011 # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay Solid waste landfills 264 (a) 92,393 338 266 91,130 334 Hazardous waste landfills 5 640 2 5 599 2 269 93,033 340 271 91,729 336 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 1 189 1 49 93,222 (b) 91,778 (b) (a) In 2012, we acquired one landfill, closed one landfill and our contract expired at one landfill. In addition, we have one landfill that will not be developed. (b) These amounts include 1.3 million tons at December 31, 2012 and 1.4 million tons at December 31, 2011 that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2012, our closed sites management group managed 211 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2012 (in millions): Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2011 $ 12,940 $ (6,931 ) $ 6,009 Capital additions 378 — 378 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 58 — 58 Acquisitions 10 — 10 Amortization of landfill airspace — (395 ) (395 ) Foreign currency translation 38 (11 ) 27 Asset retirements and other adjustments (158 ) 149 (9 ) December 31, 2012 $ 13,266 $ (7,188 ) $ 6,078 As of December 31, 2012, we estimate that we will spend approximately $500 million in 2013, and approximately $900 million in 2014 and 2015 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. 58 Table of Contents Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2012 (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2011 $ 1,292 $ 273 Obligations incurred and capitalized 58 — Obligations settled (87 ) (30 ) Interest accretion 84 4 Revisions in cost estimates and interest rate assumptions (8 ) 5 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (1 ) 1 December 31, 2012 $ 1,338 $ 253 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 84 $ 84 $ 82 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 6 23 8 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 67 76 64 Landfill remediation costs — — 63 Other landfill site costs 67 72 77 Total landfill operating costs $ 224 $ 255 $ 294 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Additionally, in 2010, we increased our cost estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing remediation projects. As these remediation projects progressed, more defined plans were developed, resulting in a net increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely remedies. In both 2012 and 2011, we had favorable revisions to environmental remediation liabilities at closed sites based on the estimated cost of the remediation alternatives prescribed by regulators. Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: Ÿ the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and 59 Table of Contents Ÿ the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from final landfill capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 395 $ 378 $ 372 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 92 90 91 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.30 $ 4.19 $ 4.08 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 269 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 has also been affected by (i) increased landfill development and environmental costs; and (ii) the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was reduced by $3 million in 2012, $11 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2010, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final capping events that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of final capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations; and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments, and we have also returned value to shareholders through share repurchases. 60 Table of Contents Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 194 $ 258 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 122 $ 123 Tax-exempt bond funds 1 14 Other 15 15 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 138 $ 152 Debt: Current portion $ 743 $ 631 Long-term portion 9,173 9,125 Total debt $ 9,916 $ 9,756 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 79 $ 102 Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans, which has increased our level of capital spending, acquisitions and investments. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2012 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt borrowings of $122 million and (ii) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, interest accretion and capital leases. As of December 31, 2012, we had (i) $688 million of debt maturing within twelve months, including $400 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, U.S.$75 million of advances outstanding under our Canadian credit facility, $161 million of tax-exempt bonds and (ii) $475 million of tax-exempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next twelve months. Based on our intent and ability to refinance a portion of this debt on a long-term basis as of December 31, 2012, we have classified $420 million of this debt as long-term and the remaining $743 million as current obligations. 61 Table of Contents We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2012 2011 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 933 $ 1,012 Letter of credit facilities(b) 492 502 Other(c) 257 251 $ 1,682 $ 1,765 (a) In May 2011, we amended and restated our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility as a result of changes in market conditions, which significantly reduced the cost of the facility. We also extended the term through May 2016. At December 31, 2012, we had $400 million of outstanding borrowings and $933 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $667 million. (b) As of December 31, 2012, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $505 million under letter of credit facilities with terms that extend from June 2013 to June 2015. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under these letter of credit facilities, and we had $13 million of unused or available credit capacity. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,295 $ 2,469 $ 2,275 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,830 ) $ (2,185 ) $ (1,606 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (530 ) $ (566 ) $ (1,273 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2012 as compared with 2011 are summarized below: Ÿ Decrease in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $109 million, on a year-over-year basis. Included in the $109 million decrease are the following items: Ÿ higher charges in 2012 related to impairments and restructuring costs of $89 million and $48 million, respectively; Ÿ lower non-cash charges attributable to equity-based compensation expense and interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets of $16 million and $17 million, respectively; and Ÿ lower bonus expense of approximately $90 million in 2012 when compared with 2011. Ÿ Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $63 million higher on a year-over-year basis as a result of the decrease in the bonus depreciation allowance from a deduction of 100% of qualifying capital expenditures for property placed in service in 2011 to a deduction of 50% of qualifying capital expenditures for property placed in service in 2012. See Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items below for additional information. Ÿ Forward starting swaps — During the first quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2012, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances were terminated 62 Table of Contents contemporaneously with the actual issuance of senior notes in February 2011 and September 2012, and we paid cash of $9 million and $59 million, respectively, to settle the liabilities related to these swap agreements. These cash payments have been classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Termination of interest rate swaps — In April 2012, we elected to terminate our $1 billion interest rate swap portfolio associated with senior notes that were scheduled to mature from November 2012 through March 2018. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $72 million in cash for their fair value. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in “Other assets” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted in 2012 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2011 and 2010 are summarized below: Ÿ Decreased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits, was approximately $242 million lower in 2011 due in large part to the extension of the bonus depreciation legislation. The ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our full year 2011 cash taxes by approximately $175 million. Also contributing to the decrease in cash paid for taxes in 2011 was an increase in federal tax credits provided by our investments in two unconsolidated entities. These investments are discussed in Note 9 and Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ÿ 2010 Non-recurring cash inflows — Two significant cash transactions benefited cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, we received $77 million for a litigation settlement, and in the third quarter of 2010, we received a $65 million federal tax refund related to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2009. Ÿ Settlement of Canadian hedge — In December 2010, our previously existing foreign currency hedges matured and we paid cash of $37 million upon settlement. The cash payment from the settlement was classified as a change in accrued liabilities within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted in 2011 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Capital expenditures — We used $1,510 million during 2012 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,324 million in 2011 and $1,104 million in 2010. The increase in capital expenditures in 2012 and 2011 is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure, and information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as our taking advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation. The year-over-year comparison of 2012 with 2011 was also affected by timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. Approximately $244 million of our fourth quarter 2011 spending was paid in cash in the first quarter of 2012 compared with approximately $206 million of our fourth quarter 2010 spending that was paid in the first quarter of 2011. 63 Table of Contents Ÿ Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $250 million in 2012 compared with $867 million in 2011 and $407 million in 2010. In 2012, our acquisitions consisted primarily of interests in oil and gas producing properties acquired through two transactions, for which we paid $94 million. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. In 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf, which provides outsourced waste and recycling services. In 2010, we paid approximately $150 million to acquire a waste-to-energy facility in Portsmouth, Virginia. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. Ÿ Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $77 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2012 primarily related to furthering our goal of expanding our service offerings and developing waste diversion technologies. We made $155 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2011. These investments included a $48 million payment made to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company, which was established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility in North Dakota, and $107 million of investments primarily related to furthering our goal of growing into new markets by investing in greener technologies. We made $173 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2010. These cash investments were primarily related to a $142 million payment made to acquire a 40% equity investment in SEG, a subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd. As a joint venture partner in SEG, we participate in the operation and management of waste-to-energy and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG’s focus also includes building new waste-to-energy facilities in China. Ÿ Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $14 million to our investing activities in 2012 compared with $107 million in 2011 and $48 million in 2010. The significant decrease in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2012 and 2010 was due to a decrease in tax-exempt borrowings. Ÿ Other — Net cash used by our other investing activities of $51 million during 2012 was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with our Wheelabrator’s investments in Europe. Net cash provided by our other investing activities of $18 million during 2011 was primarily related to the receipt of a payment of $17 million associated with a note receivable from a prior year divestiture. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Share repurchases and dividend payments — For the periods presented, all share repurchases and dividend payments have been approved by our Board of Directors. We paid an aggregate of $658 million in cash dividends during 2012, compared with $637 million in 2011 and $604 million in 2010. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.315 in 2010, to $0.34 in 2011, and to $0.355 in 2012 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2010 and 2011 as a result of our share repurchase programs. We paid $575 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with $501 million in 2010. We repurchased approximately 17 million and 15 million shares of our common stock in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We did not repurchase any shares during 2012. In December 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.355 to $0.365 per share for dividends declared in 2013. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Additionally, the Board of Directors authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases in 64 Table of Contents connection with the 2013 financial plan. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. Ÿ Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $43 million of financing cash inflows during 2012 compared with $45 million during 2011 and $54 million during 2010. Ÿ Net debt borrowings (repayments) — Net debt borrowings were $122 million and $698 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and net debt repayments were $204 million in 2010. The following summarizes our cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Borrowings: Revolving credit facility(a) $ 400 $ 150 $ — Canadian credit facility(a) 189 137 316 Senior notes 495 893 592 Capital leases and other 96 21 — $ 1,180 $ 1,201 $ 908 Repayments: Revolving credit facility(a) $ (150 ) $ — $ — Canadian credit facility(a) (257 ) (214 ) (372 ) Senior notes (400 ) (147 ) (600 ) Tax-exempt bonds (129 ) (55 ) (91 ) Capital leases and other debt (122 ) (87 ) (49 ) $ (1,058 ) $ (503 ) $ (1,112 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ 122 $ 698 $ (204 ) (a) Due to the short-term maturities of the borrowings under these credit facilities, we have reported certain of these cash flows on a net basis. During 2012, we did not have any significant non-cash activities. For the year ended December 31, 2011, non-cash activities included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds, of $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not have any tax-exempt bond financings; however, we did have a $215 million non-cash increase in our debt obligations as a result of the issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. This investment is discussed in detail in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ÿ Other —Net cash used in other financing activities was $2 million and $46 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, while net cash provided by other financing activities was $18 million in 2010. These activities are primarily attributable to changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances due to the timing of cash deposits or payments. During 2011, the cash used for these activities included $7 million of financing costs paid in May to amend and restate our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The cash provided by changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances in 2010 was offset, in part, by $13 million of financing costs paid in June to initially execute our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. 65 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 102 $ 95 $ 114 $ 112 $ 93 $ 2,041 $ 2,557 Environmental remediation 28 20 29 25 13 127 242 130 115 143 137 106 2,168 2,799 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 695 468 462 728 281 7,210 9,844 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 106 92 78 61 54 465 856 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 135 83 43 24 16 230 531 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2012 $ 1,066 $ 758 $ 726 $ 950 $ 457 $ 10,073 $ 14,030 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2012 include $475 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 66 Table of Contents Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items Recent Legislation — The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013 and included an extension for one year of the 50% bonus depreciation allowance. The provision specifically applies to qualifying property placed in service before January 1, 2014. The acceleration of deductions on capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions has no impact on our effective tax rate, but reduces our cash taxes in the periods in which the deductions are taken. The acceleration of depreciation deductions related to qualifying property additions in 2012 decreased our full year 2012 cash taxes by approximately $90 million and, based on our current forecast of 2013 capital expenditures, we estimate an additional reduction in our full year 2013 cash taxes of approximately $90 million related to qualifying property additions in 2013. However, taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. On a net basis, after taking into account the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs, the deductions taken in previous years from acceleration programs more than offset the benefits received in 2012 and expected to be received in 2013. Our full year tax payments were approximately $60 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011. Uncertain Tax Positions — We have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We anticipate that approximately $14 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest, and $3 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed within the next twelve months. The anticipated reversals are related to state tax items, none of which are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. In addition, there are federal items related to the tax implications of the book impairments discussed in Note 13 that also are anticipated to reverse within the next 12 months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2012, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2012, over 20% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2012, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. 67 Table of Contents Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2012, we had $9.9 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2013. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $587 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $475 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within twelve months; (iii) $400 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility; and (iv) U.S.$75 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2013 interest expense by approximately $13 million. As of December 31, 2011, the effective interest rates of approximately $2.2 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within twelve months. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. In addition, at December 31, 2012, we had forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $175 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $800 million at December 31, 2012. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. With the exception of electricity commodity derivatives, which are discussed below, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended December 31, 2012. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. During 2012, approximately 56% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently expect that nearly 56% of our electricity revenues at our waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2013. Our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as long-term power purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium- and long-term electricity contracts. As we renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our waste-to-energy facilities will be based on variable market rates. Accordingly, in 2010, we implemented a more actively managed energy program, which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives. 68 Table of Contents Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada and investments in China and the United Kingdom. From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives. The foreign currency exposure associated with our investments in China and the United Kingdom has not been material. 69 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:56.483498
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this report. Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Solid Waste $ 13,477 $ 13,056 $ 12,998 Wheelabrator 845 846 877 Other 2,185 2,106 1,534 Intercompany (2,524 ) (2,359 ) (2,031 ) Total $ 13,983 $ 13,649 $ 13,378 The services we provide include collection, landfill (solid and hazardous waste landfills), transfer, operation of waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants, recycling and resource recovery and other services, as described below. The following table shows revenues (in millions) contributed by these services for each of the three years presented: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Collection $ 8,513 $ 8,405 $ 8,406 Landfill 2,790 2,685 2,611 Transfer 1,329 1,296 1,280 Wheelabrator 845 846 877 Recycling 1,447 1,360 1,580 Other 1,583 1,416 655 Intercompany (2,524 ) (2,359 ) (2,031 ) Total $ 13,983 $ 13,649 $ 13,378 Collection. Our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station, material recovery facility (“MRF”) or disposal site. We generally provide collection services under one of two types of arrangements: Ÿ For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the agreements are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel containers to most customers to store their solid waste between pick-up dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one employee. Ÿ For most residential collection services, we have a contract with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of three to six years. We also provide services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to households. The fees for residential collection are either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service. 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Landfill. Landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2013, we owned or operated 262 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills, which represents the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations during its design, construction, operation and closure. The operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace. All solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, as a result, third-party haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited. Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers. Transfer. At December 31, 2013, we owned or operated 300 transfer stations in North America. We deposit waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites. At December 31, 2013, our medical waste services business (discussed below) also had 15 smaller transfer operations (separate from its 8 processing facilities, but some of which are located at other existing Company facilities) that are permitted to consolidate regulated medical waste collections for disposal. Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site and general market factors. The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks, railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites. The transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties. There are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station. 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Wheelabrator. As of December 31, 2013, we owned or operated 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants (“IPPs”) which are located in the Northeast, in the Mid-Atlantic, and in Florida, California and Washington. At our waste-to-energy facilities, solid waste is burned at high temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted into high-pressure steam. As of December 31, 2013, our waste-to-energy facilities were capable of processing up to approximately 23,000 tons of solid waste each day. In 2013, our waste-to-energy facilities received and processed 8 million tons of solid waste, or approximately 21,000 tons per day. Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into steam. The plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm), tires, landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are integral to the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood, waste tires, railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite culm facility in Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago. Ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by decades of coal mining. We generate steam at our waste-to-energy and IPPs facilities for the production of electricity. We sell the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale markets, which include investor-owned utilities, power marketers and regional power pools. Some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end users. Fees charged for electricity and steam at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs have generally been subject to the terms and conditions of long-term contracts that include interim adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market conditions such as inflation, electricity prices and other general market factors. In recent years several of our long-term energy contracts and short-term pricing arrangements expired, significantly increasing our waste-to-energy revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in market prices for electricity, which generally correlate with fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we operate. Our market-price volatility will continue to increase as additional long-term contracts expire. We use short-term, “receive fixed, pay variable” electricity commodity swaps to reduce the variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity. Refer to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of this report for additional information about the Company’s current considerations related to the management of this market exposure. In 2013, we continued to look at opportunities to expand our waste-to-energy business. In recent years, we have partnered with third parties to invest in the expansion of waste-to-energy assets and services in the United Kingdom and China. While there has not been any meaningful expansion of the network of waste-to-energy disposal facilities in the U.S. during this time, we have invested significant efforts in Europe and China to further develop these assets. We have made investments in partnerships and joint ventures in the United Kingdom and China in order to use our expertise as an owner and operator of waste-to-energy facilities to participate in this growth opportunity. The investments we have made are discussed further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recycling. Our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage. In 2001, we became the first major solid waste company to focus on residential single-stream recycling, which allows customers to mix recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin. Residential single-stream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates. Single-stream recycling is possible through the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies. We have also been advancing the single-stream recycling programs for commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include the following: Materials processing — Through our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our MRFs for processing. We operate 120 MRFs where paper, cardboard, metals, plastics, glass, construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale. We also operate five secondary processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods. Materials processing services include data destruction and automated color sorting. 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Plastics materials recycling — Using state-of-the-art sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient. Commodities recycling — We market and resell recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands and product quality. Fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of recyclable commodities being processed, the volume or weight of the recyclable material, degree of processing required, the market value of the recovered material and other market factors. Some of the recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are purchased from various sources, including third parties and our own operations. The cost per ton of material purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods to our customers to whom we sell such materials. The price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate.” Rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods and on market conditions, but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect our revenues, the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our operating income from operations margins. Other. Other services we provide include the following: We provide recycling brokerage services, which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties. The experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties. Utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers, we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements. We also provide electronics recycling. We recycle discarded computers, communications equipment, and other electronic equipment. Services include the collection, sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials. In recent years, we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “take-back” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe manner. Our WM Sustainability Services organization offers our customers in all Areas a variety of services in collaboration with our Area and strategic accounts programs, including (i) in-plant services, where our employees work full-time inside our customers’ facilities to provide full-service waste management solutions and consulting services; (ii) specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations and (iii) services associated with the disposal of fly ash, residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks. Our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate, identifying recycling opportunities and determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal. We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our WM Renewable Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. The EPA endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At December 31, 2013, we had 137 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 124 of our solid waste landfills and four third-party landfills. At 109 of these landfills, the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or power cooperatives. At 17 landfills, the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At 10 landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers. At one landfill, the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel. 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services, our strategic accounts program works with customers whose locations span the United States. Our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs. In 2011, we acquired Oakleaf Global Holdings and its primary operations (“Oakleaf”), which provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of third-party haulers. Oakleaf has increased our strategic accounts customer base and enhanced our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions. We continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations. These investments include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership interests. The solutions and services include the collection of project waste, including construction debris and household or yard waste, through our Bagster® program; the development, operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities; operation of a landfill gas-to-liquid natural gas plant; solar powered trash compactors; and organic waste-to-fuel conversion technology. Part of our expansion of services includes offering portable self-storage services; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; and a sharps mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose of their used syringes and lancets using our MedWaste Tracker® system. In addition, we have made investments that involve the acquisition and development of interests in oil and gas producing properties. Finally, we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities and commercial customers under the name Port-o-Let®, we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot sweeping services. Competition We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition in our Solid Waste business based on pricing and quality of service. We have also begun competing for business based on service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste. Seasonal Trends Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While 9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. Employees At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 42,700 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,400 were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations. Approximately 9,200 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations Financial Assurance Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting variable-rate tax-exempt debt and (iii) estimated final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity. The following table summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts (in millions) of financial assurance that we had outstanding as of December 31, 2013: Surety bonds: Issued by consolidated subsidiary(a) $ 181 Issued by affiliated entity(b) 1,079 Issued by third-party surety companies 2,172 Total surety bonds $ 3,432 Letters of credit: Revolving credit facilities(c) 872 Letter of credit facilities(d) 400 Other lines of credit 267 Total letters of credit 1,539 Insurance policies: Issued by consolidated subsidiary(a) 1,157 Issued by affiliated entity(b) 32 Issued by third-party insurance companies 212 Total insurance policies 1,401 Funded trust and escrow accounts(e) 140 Financial guarantees(f) 117 Total financial assurance(g) $ 6,629 (a) We use surety bonds and insurance policies issued by a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Guaranty Insurance Company of Vermont, the sole business of which is to issue financial assurance on our behalf. National Guaranty Insurance Company is authorized to write up to approximately $1.5 billion in surety bonds or insurance policies for our final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, waste collection contracts and other business-related obligations. 10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (b) We hold a noncontrolling interest in an entity that we use to obtain financial assurance. Our contractual agreement with this entity does not specifically limit the amounts of surety bonds or insurance that we may obtain, making our financial assurance under this agreement limited only by the guidelines and restrictions of surety and insurance regulations. (c) WM has a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility with a term extending through July 2018. At December 31, 2013, we had $420 million of outstanding borrowings and $872 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility. The unused and available credit capacity of the facility was $958 million as of December 31, 2013. We also have a C$150 million revolving credit facility which matures in November 2017 and provides for up to C$50 million of letter of credit capacity. At December 31, 2013, we had no letters of credit outstanding under this facility and outstanding borrowings of C$10 million. The unused and available credit capacity of this facility was C$140 million as of December 31, 2013, of which C$50 million may be used for letters of credit. (d) We have an aggregate committed capacity of $400 million under letter of credit facilities with terms ending through December 2016. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of December 31, 2013. (e) Our funded trust and escrow accounts generally have been established to support landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations and our performance under various operating contracts. Balances maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual arrangements; (iii) the use of funds for qualifying activities; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills and (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments held in the trust fund or escrow accounts. The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established. (f) Financial guarantees are provided primarily to support our performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. The amount of financial assurance provided by such guarantees is dependent upon measures of our tangible net worth and other criteria. (g) The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be drawn and used to meet the closure, post-closure and remedial obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established. Other than these permitted draws on funds, virtually no claims have been made against our financial assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current financial position, management does not expect there to be claims against these instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In an ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity, we are continually evaluating various options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance. Insurance We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. As of December 31, 2013, our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy carried self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2013, our auto liability insurance program included a per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to additional deductibles of $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million layer. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2013 are summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers directors and officers directly for loss, 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements including defense costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company, as the Company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers. Regulation Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the United States and Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a management or disposal facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage. The primary United States federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below: Ÿ The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991, the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations. Ÿ The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (“CERCLA”) which is also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations to a potentially responsible party, or PRP, that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations. Ÿ The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water runoff that require landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions. Ÿ The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal solid waste landfills and municipal waste-to-energy facilities. In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for municipal solid waste landfills subject to the new source performance standards. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on- or off-site. The EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Defense Fund to evaluate the 1996 new source performance standards and emission guidelines for new and existing landfills as required by the Clean Air Act every eight years and revise them if deemed necessary. The EPA is scheduled to issue a proposed rule in February 2014 and finalize the rule in December 2014. Should the EPA adopt more stringent requirements, additional landfills may become subject to the rule and related capital expenditures and operating costs may increase. However, we do not believe that the regulatory changes would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. The EPA has also issued new source performance standards and emission guidelines for large and small municipal waste-to-energy facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards. These sources are also subject to operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards applicable to municipal waste-to-energy facilities every five years. The EPA has not initiated or announced a schedule for the required review of the standards for large waste-to-energy facilities, so we are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with possible regulatory revisions. Additionally, standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles). The EPA continues to evaluate and develop regulations to increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions; such regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet, but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. Ÿ The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, (“OSHA”) establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. We are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in United States federal regulations affecting our business: Ÿ In 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. Air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills, waste-to-energy facilities and landfill gas-to-energy facilities could be affected. However, the degree of impact is dependent upon the EPA’s final determination on permitting of biogenic carbon dioxide emissions, as well as the EPA’s or implementing states’ determinations on what may constitute “Best Available Control Technology” for new projects exceeding certain thresholds. In addition, recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards and related PSD increment/significance thresholds could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills, waste-to-energy facilities and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. At December 31, 2013, we had 137 projects at solid waste landfills where landfill gas was captured and utilized for its renewable energy value rather than flared. Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls, with associated capital or operating costs; however, we do not believe that such regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate.” We are striving to anticipate the future needs of our customers by investing in and developing ever-more-advanced recycling and reuse technologies. Potential climate change and GHG regulatory initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide low-carbon services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. If the U.S. were to impose a carbon tax or other form of GHG regulation increasing demand for low-carbon service offerings in the future, the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable. Ÿ In 2011, the EPA published the Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials (“NHSM”) Rule, which provides the standards and procedures for identifying whether NHSM are solid waste under RCRA when used as fuels or ingredients in combustion units. The EPA also published new source performance standards and emission guidelines for commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units, and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards for commercial and industrial boilers. The EPA published clarifications and amendments to these rules in 2013, and there is litigation surrounding the rules. Although the recently published amendments are generally favorable to our industry, some of the potential regulatory interpretations are undergoing review and other regulatory outcomes may be dependent on case-by-case administrative determinations. These could have a significant impact on some of our projects in which we are seeking to convert biomass or other secondary materials into products, fuels or energy. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these rulemakings or pending administrative determinations at the present time. However, we believe the rules and administrative determinations will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole and are more likely to facilitate our efforts to reuse or recover energy value from secondary material streams. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements State, Provincial and Local Regulations There are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements. Our landfill and waste-to-energy operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill and waste-to-energy disposal. Several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills or waste-to-energy facilities. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the U.S. Congress and the EPA. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Foreign Export Regulation Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics. The higher quality expectations 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of the material being scrutinized by the Chinese government, which resulted in increased processing and residual disposal costs. Despite these increased costs, we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations. We are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly. Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation Our Energy Service line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. On the other hand, we believe the size, capital structure, regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our Company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services. Emissions from Natural Gas Fueling and Infrastructure We currently operate the largest compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fleet in the waste industry, and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. We have constructed and operate 58 natural gas fueling stations, 27 of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties, in 24 states and two Canadian provinces. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. We have partnered with the environmental organization Environmental Defense Fund, as well as other heavy-duty equipment users and experts, on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers. We anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavy-duty fleet may ultimately result in regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our current plan to continue transitioning to CNG vehicles. Federal, State and Local Climate Change Initiatives In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity. We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 1A. Risk Factors. In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend” and words of similar nature and generally include statements containing: Ÿ projections about accounting and finances; Ÿ plans and objectives for the future; Ÿ projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or Ÿ our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance. You should view these statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2014 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the Company. The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively-bid contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. When this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business. If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected. Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview for more information on our business strategy. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following: Ÿ Our strategy may result in a significant change to our business, and our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. Ÿ We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively. Ÿ Customer segmentation could result in fragmentation of our efforts, rather than improved customer relationships. Ÿ In efforts to enhance our revenues, we have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we have continued our fuel surcharge program to offset fuel costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. Ÿ We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result. Ÿ Our restructuring may not achieve and/or maintain the goals and cost savings intended. Ÿ On-going rationalization of our asset portfolio following our restructuring may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets. Ÿ Our ability to make strategic acquisitions and to invest in technologies depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition or investment targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions. Ÿ Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others. Ÿ Integration of acquisitions, investments and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Ÿ Execution of our strategy may cause us to incur substantial research and development costs, make substantial investments in emerging technologies and/or incur additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations. Ÿ We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Compliance with existing or future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures. Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as: Ÿ limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities; Ÿ limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; Ÿ limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; Ÿ mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or Ÿ limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations. We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility, or EPR, are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of the material being scrutinized by the Chinese government, which resulted in increased processing and residual disposal costs. If Operation Green Fence or other similar regulations increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices. Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities, particularly demand from Chinese paper mills, can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively, as we have experienced in 2012 and 2013, or positively, as we experienced in 2011. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The decline in market prices in 2013 and 2012 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $79 million and $428 million, respectively. In 2011, increases in the prices of recycling commodities resulted in a year-over-year increase in revenue of $216 million. Overall commodity prices decreased year-over-year 5% and 25% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and prices increased year-over-year 18% in 2011. These prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future. Additionally, our recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers. Therefore, even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. There are also significant price fluctuations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery, waste-to-energy and independent power production plant operations that can significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such businesses. In most of the markets in which we operate, electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 56%, 56% and 54%, respectively, of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates. Our waste-to-energy facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will continue to increase as additional long-term contracts expire. We may not be able to enter into renewal contracts on comparable or favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to successfully negotiate long-term contracts, or if market prices are at lower levels for sustained periods, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and waste-to-energy facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill and waste-to-energy disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills or waste-to-energy facilities. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or waste-to-energy facility, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and waste-to-energy facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to operate our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities at full capacity, as well as affecting the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal and waste-to-energy services. Our landfills and our waste-to-energy facilities currently provide and have historically provided our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills or waste-to-energy facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results will decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is reasonably possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives. Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities and our profitability. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space and waste-to-energy facilities. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives. If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer. Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies. Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which: Ÿ agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and Ÿ local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments. Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results. We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties due to the downturn in the economy, reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, we had $577 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $939 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months. If the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses. The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Average diesel fuel prices decreased in 2013 but increased in both 2012 and 2011. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we are currently party to pending litigation that pertains to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices and generally alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to customer service contracts. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins. We are expanding our compressed natural gas (“CNG”) truck fleet, which makes us increasingly dependent on the availability of CNG and CNG fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to CNG prices. We currently operate the largest CNG fleet in the waste industry, and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. However, CNG is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. Until the public and third parties in North America broadly adopt CNG, which may not be on the timetable we anticipate, it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in CNG fueling infrastructure in order to power our CNG fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of CNG could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between CNG and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in CNG vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for CNG may not effectively be recovered by this program. We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage. Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions. Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans. We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and (iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan. In connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations, which result in the decline of Company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan, could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal. In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status, including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan, the ongoing solvency of participating employers, the investment returns obtained on plan assets, and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation; depending on such factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular reporting period. We reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized related expenses of $5 million in 2013 and $10 million in 2012. We are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals, which could be higher than the charges we have recognized. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, mass instability or waste slides, severe weather and natural disasters, which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials and odors, injury or death of employees and others, or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken. Additionally, we have built and are operating CNG fueling stations to serve our growing fleet of CNG trucks, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations, landfill gas collection and control systems and waste to energy plants involves additional risks of fire and explosion. All of these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, and property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities. The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. We may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets. In accordance with GAAP, we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or fail to maintain our desired credit profile. If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have $2.4 billion of debt as of December 31, 2013 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and Canadian credit facility and term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$150 million Canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2018 and November 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had $420 million of outstanding borrowings and $872 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $958 million, and we had $9 million of borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate. Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. On October 1, 2013, the Supreme Court granted petitions for certiorari to consider whether the EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act. If the Supreme Court decides that permitting requirements were triggered for GHGs, and if certain changes to these regulations are enacted, such as the lowering of thresholds or inclusion of biogenic emissions, such amendments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows that would not be mitigated by increased revenues associated with the services we offer customers to reduce their GHG footprints. Changes in oil and gas prices and drilling activity, and changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production, could adversely affect our Energy Service business. We provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations. Demand for these services may be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, including changes in oil and gas prices. Additionally, changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and “one-time” special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. The operating results of our first quarter often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations. Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties. The construction of new international waste-to-energy facilities is subject to many business risks and uncertainties that could cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated. Our Wheelabrator business has invested in growing its waste-to-energy business in China and Europe through partnerships and joint ventures established to develop, construct and/or operate new facilities. Development and construction of a waste-to-energy facility is a complex, capital intensive, long-term process subject to risks of delays, cost overruns, failure to receive governmental or regulatory approvals and financing difficulty. Additionally, technology incorporated in such facilities may not perform as anticipated. Any of these risks, among others, may cause such projects to fail to achieve the financial results anticipated, which could have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, the financing, development, construction and operation of projects outside the United States can entail significant political and financial risks, which vary by country, including: Ÿ changes in law or regulations; Ÿ changes in disposal and electricity pricing; Ÿ changes in foreign tax laws and regulations; 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ changes in United States federal, state and local laws, including tax laws, related to foreign operations; Ÿ compliance with United States federal, state and local foreign corrupt practices laws; Ÿ changes in government policies or personnel; Ÿ changes in general economic conditions affecting each country, including conditions in financial markets; Ÿ changes in labor relations in operations outside the United States; Ÿ political, economic or military instability and civil unrest; and Ÿ credit quality of entities that purchase our power. The legal and financial environment in foreign countries could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements. Any or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation. Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity. We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations. Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 440,000 square feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Texas, Connecticut, New Hampshire, the United Kingdom and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states. We also have operations in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and throughout Canada. Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with our strategic growth plans.

Cash dividends declared and paid were $683 million in 2013, or $1.46 per common share, $658 million in 2012, or $1.42 per common share, and $637 million in 2011, or $1.36 per common share. In February 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.365 to $0.375 per share for dividends declared in 2014. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Our share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases, and we repurchased $239 million of our common stock pursuant to that authorization in 2013. In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized up to $600 million in future share repurchases; this authorization both replaces and increases the amount that remained available for share repurchases under the prior authorization. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2013. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Every day, we are helping industries, communities and individuals reduce, reuse and remove waste better through sound sustainability strategies. We have a precise day-to-day focus on collecting and handling our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly. Meanwhile, we are also developing and implementing new ways to handle and extract value from waste. Our employees are committed to delivering environmental performance — our mission is to maximize resource value, while minimizing environmental impact, so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Drawing on our resources and experience, we actively pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve and the environment. We are also committed to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing on our strategic goals of optimizing our business, knowing and servicing the customer better than anyone else, and extracting more value from the materials we handle. In pursuit of these long-term goals, we have sharpened our focus on the following key priorities: Ÿ Pursue revenue growth through customer-focused segmentation, pricing discipline and strategic acquisitions; Ÿ Continually emphasize cost control and investment in technology and systems that enhance the efficiency of our operations; and Ÿ Invest in emerging technologies that offer alternatives to traditional disposal and generate additional value from the waste, recycling and other streams we manage. We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued growth and leadership in a dynamic industry, as customers increasingly seek non-traditional solutions. Notable items of our 2013 financial results include: Ÿ Revenues of $14.0 billion in 2013 compared with $13.6 billion in 2012, an increase of $334 million, or 2.4%. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) positive revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations of $235 million, or 2.1%, and (ii) revenue from acquisitions, driven in large part by our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI, which increased revenues by $138 million and $80 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes, which decreased our revenues by $133 million; Ÿ Operating expenses of $9.1 billion in 2013, or 65.2% of revenues, compared with $8.9 billion, or 65.1% of revenues, in 2012. This increase of $233 million is largely due to (i) our acquisition of Greenstar, which increased operating expenses by $131 million, and was primarily related to cost of goods sold and, to a lesser extent, labor and related benefits and other categories; (ii) higher labor and related benefits due to merit increases and higher incentive compensation costs attributed to higher anticipated payouts and (iii) higher costs from the acquired RCI operations, primarily subcontractor costs and, to a lesser extent, cost of goods sold. The increases attributable to Greenstar and RCI were incurred in connection with the acquisition revenues discussed above; 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,468 million in 2013, or 10.5% of revenues, compared with $1,472 million, or 10.8% of revenues, in 2012. This decrease of $4 million is primarily due to our restructuring efforts and cost control initiatives and the collection of reserved receivables in Puerto Rico offset, in part, by higher compensation costs due to an increase in the accrual for incentive plan payouts due to improved performance; Ÿ Income from operations of $1.1 billion, or 7.7% of revenues, in 2013 compared with $1.9 billion, or 13.6% of revenues, in 2012, the decrease of which is primarily attributable to the impairment charges discussed below; Ÿ Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $98 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for 2013, as compared with $817 million, or $1.76 per diluted share for 2012, the decrease of which is primarily attributable to the impairment charges discussed below; Ÿ Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,455 million in 2013, as compared with $2,295 million in 2012, an increase $160 million; and Ÿ In 2013, we returned $683 million and $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, respectively, compared with $658 million through dividends in 2012. The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2013 results with 2012 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2013 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $1.0 billion, primarily related to (i) a $483 million charge to impair goodwill associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $262 million of charges to impair certain landfills, primarily in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) $144 million of charges to write down the carrying value of three waste-to-energy facilities and (iv) $71 million of impairment charges relating to investments in waste diversion technology companies. We do not expect these impairment charges to materially impact our future results of operations or cash flows. These items had a negative impact of $1.91 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $23 million primarily related to our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI as well as our July 2012 restructuring and other charges. These items had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. The following explanation of certain notable items that impacted the comparability of our 2012 results with 2011 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2012 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $109 million attributable primarily to facilities in our medical waste services business and investments in waste diversion technologies. These items had a negative impact of $0.17 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax restructuring costs aggregating $82 million primarily related to our July 2012 restructuring as well as integration costs associated with our acquisition of Oakleaf. These items had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $10 million related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and a pre-tax charge of $6 million resulting from a labor union dispute. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $10 million related to an accrual for legal reserves and the impact of a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our environmental remediation liabilities. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2011 results were affected by the following: Ÿ The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $24 million as a result of a litigation loss, which had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share; 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges, excluding charges recognized in the operating results of Oakleaf, of $17 million related to our cost savings programs. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs and had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $11 million related to the Oakleaf acquisition, which includes the operating results of Oakleaf and related interest expense and integration costs. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of a favorable pre-tax benefit of $9 million from a revision to an environmental remediation liability at a closed landfill, which had a positive impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; Ÿ The recognition of non-cash, pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9 million primarily related to two of our medical waste services facilities. The impairment charges had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share; and Ÿ The recognition of a tax benefit of $19 million due to favorable tax audit settlements and favorable adjustments relating to the finalization of our 2010 tax returns. These items had a positive impact of $0.04 on our diluted earnings per share. We experienced notably stronger free cash flow in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to improvements in cash flow from operations, primarily as a result of our pricing discipline. In 2013, we delivered on our prior expectation related to pricing, with internal revenue growth from yield at its highest level for the year in the fourth quarter and greater than 2.0% for the full year for the first time since 2010. Our cash flow also benefitted from our increased focus on capital spending management, and we continued to see the anticipated benefits from our cost savings programs, including lower selling, general and administrative costs when compared to 2012. Further, we increased the amount we returned to stockholders in 2013 compared to 2012 by increasing our dividend and repurchasing shares. Our fourth quarter and full year results for 2013 have laid a foundation that we expect will benefit us in 2014, allowing us to focus on generating solid earnings and cash flow driven by increased yield and cost controls. We also expect to continue to use our free cash flow to pay our dividends, repurchase shares, reduce debt and make appropriate acquisitions and investments in our traditional solid waste business. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,455 $ 2,295 $ 2,469 Capital expenditures (1,271 ) (1,510 ) (1,324 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets (a) 138 44 53 Free cash flow $ 1,322 $ 829 $ 1,198 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (a) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the receipt of a payment of $17 million related to a note receivable from a prior year divestiture. This receipt is included as a component of “Other” within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period in 2012, the increase of $160 million was primarily related to the impact of higher cash earnings, favorable impacts of working capital changes and the payment of $59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in September 2012. The increase was partially offset by an increase in tax payments of $145 million and the favorable cash receipt of $72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in April 2012. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 to the comparable period in 2011, the decrease of $174 million was primarily related to the impact of lower cash earnings, an increase in tax payments of $63 million, the payment of $59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in September 2012 and unfavorable impacts of working capital changes. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable cash receipt of $72 million resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in April 2012. The decrease in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management. The increase in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended December 31, 2012 to the comparable period in 2011 is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure and growth initiatives, and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. We generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on capital spending in the fourth quarter of each year. A more significant portion of our fourth quarter 2011 spending was paid in cash in 2012 than in the preceding year. Acquisitions Greenstar, LLC — On January 31, 2013, we paid $170 million inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Greenstar, LLC (“Greenstar”). Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, up to an additional $40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018, of which $20 million is guaranteed. The remaining $20 million of this consideration is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and had a preliminary estimated fair value at closing of $16 million. Greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions, having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers. Since the acquisition date, the Greenstar business has recognized revenues of $139 million and net losses of $17 million, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. RCI Environnement, Inc. — On July 5, 2013, we paid C$509 million, or $481 million, to acquire substantially all of the assets of RCI Environnement, Inc. (“RCI”), the largest waste management company in Quebec, and certain related entities. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, was C$515 million, or $487 million. RCI provides collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec. Since the acquisition date, the RCI business has recognized revenues of $87 million and net income of $7 million, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Oakleaf Global Holdings — On July 28, 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf. Oakleaf provides outsourced waste and recycling services through a nationwide network of third-party haulers. We acquired Oakleaf to advance our growth and transformation strategies and increase our national accounts customer base while enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive environmental solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, subsequent to the acquisition date, Oakleaf recognized revenues of $265 million and net income of less than $1 million, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Comprehensive Income — In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to provide information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Additionally, companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. The amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the Company on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have presented the information required by this amendment in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income were effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and have been applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing — In July 2012, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. The amendments were effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurement — In May 2011, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements. This amended guidance defines certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with GAAP. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements were effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and have been applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing — In September 2011, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with goodwill impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two-step impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendments were effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2011 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — In October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual deliverables within an arrangement are required to be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance associated with multiple-deliverable revenue 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements arrangements became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: Ÿ Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; Ÿ It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Ÿ We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; Ÿ There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Ÿ Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Ÿ Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 25 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2013, seven landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Three of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining four landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements multi-level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Ÿ Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; Ÿ Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; Ÿ The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and Ÿ The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on a nonrecurring basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “Goodwill impairments” and “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” line items in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below. Landfills — The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Expansion Airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. At December 31, 2013, one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the expansion permit is probable, is not currently accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for this site was $261 million at December 31, 2013. We performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying value of this site. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in some cases, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the reported periods. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted on a nonrecurring basis, we assess our goodwill for impairment using Level 3 inputs. We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our annual fourth quarter impairment tests for our Wheelabrator business during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. In the second quarter of 2012, we believed an impairment indicator existed such that the fair value of our Wheelabrator business could potentially be less than its carrying amount because of the negative effect on our revenues of the continued deterioration of electricity commodity prices, coupled with our continued increased exposure to market prices as a result of the expiration of several long-term, fixed-rate electricity commodity contracts at our waste-to-energy and independent power facilities, and the expiration of several long-term disposal contracts at above-market rates. We performed the interim quantitative assessment using both an income and a market approach in the second quarter of 2012, which indicated that the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we again performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances, which indicated that the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10% compared to an excess of 30% at our annual fourth quarter 2011 test. This quantitative assessment was performed using both an income and market approach. During 2013, we noted no indicators of impairment that required us to perform an interim impairment test; however, during our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our Wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $483 million, which had no related tax benefit. We estimated the implied fair value of our Wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches. Because the annual impairment test indicated that Wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, we performed the “step two” analysis. In the “step two” analysis, the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, power contracts, customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. The factors contributing to the $483 million goodwill impairment charge principally relate to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which Wheelabrator operates, characterized by lower available disposal volumes (which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue, as well as the amount of electricity Wheelabrator is able to generate), lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as our facilities age. These factors caused us, relative to the 2012 impairment test, to lower assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue, and increase assumed operating costs. Additionally, the discount factor utilized in the income approach increased relative to that utilized in 2012 mainly due to increases in interest rates. If market prices for electricity are lower than our projections, our disposal volumes or rates decline, our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts or our costs of capital increase, the estimated fair value of our Wheelabrator business could further decrease and potentially result in an additional impairment charge in a future period. We will continue to monitor our Wheelabrator business and the recoverability of the remaining $305 million goodwill balance. As a result of our annual fourth quarter impairment tests for our Eastern Canada Area during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. In 2013 and 2012, our annual goodwill impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair value of our Eastern Canada Area exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15% and 5%, respectively. These quantitative assessments were performed using both an income and market approach. If we do not achieve our anticipated disposal volumes, our collection or disposal rates decline, our costs or capital expenditures exceed our forecasts, costs of capital increase, or we do not receive anticipated landfill expansions, the estimated fair value of our Eastern Canada Area could decrease and potentially result in an impairment charge in a future period. We will continue to monitor our Eastern Canada Area. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Goodwill Impairments and Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. Our waste-to-energy revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator business, are based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy and steam. Our “Other” lines of business include WM Sustainability Business Services, our landfill gas-to-energy operations, Port-O-Let® services, portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below.

We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related-business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related-business basis (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2013 vs. 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange2012 vs. 2011 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness(i) Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness(i) Average yield: Collection, landfill and transfer $ 241 2.2 % $ 107 1.0 % Waste-to-energy disposal(ii) (6 ) (1.4 ) (21 ) (4.6 ) Collection and disposal(ii) 235 2.1 86 0.8 Recycling commodities (79 ) (5.8 ) (428 ) (26.6 ) Electricity(ii) 18 6.8 (10 ) (3.7 ) Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 32 4.9 33 5.3 Total $ 206 1.5 $ (319 ) (2.4 ) (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.

Our revenues increased $334 million, or 2.4%, and $271 million, or 2.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The year-over-year change in revenues for both periods has been driven by (i) acquisitions, particularly the acquisitions of Greenstar in January 2013 and RCI in July 2013, which increased revenues by $138 million and $80 million, respectively, and the acquisition of Oakleaf in July 2011, which increased revenues by $314 million for 2012; (ii) increased revenue growth from our collection and disposal average yield; (iii) higher revenues provided by our fuel surcharge program; (iv) market factors, including fluctuations in electricity prices at our merchant waste-to-energy facilities that favorably affected our revenues in 2013 but negatively affected our revenues in 2012; recyclable commodity prices that negatively affected 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements revenues in both 2013 and 2012 and foreign currency translation, which negatively affected revenues from our Canadian operations in both 2013 and 2012 and (v) lower volumes, which drove revenue declines in 2013, while higher volumes drove revenue increases in 2012. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield during both years includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $235 million, or 2.1%, and $86 million, or 0.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This revenue growth from yield in 2013 was primarily driven by an aggressive pricing strategy, which decreased the dollar impact of rollbacks associated with those price increases and improved pricing on our new business, primarily in our collection operations, with growth of $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2013 and 2012, as follows: Average YieldYears Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Commercial 3.3 % 1.4 % Industrial 4.5 % 1.9 % Residential 1.8 % 0.6 % While our collection line of business was the primary driver of the year-over-year yield growth in both periods presented, our 2013 growth was more significant than our growth during 2012. This was driven, in part, by our more aggressive pricing strategy implemented in 2013. Conversely, our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy, with more significant volume declines during 2013. However, our pricing actions and our focus on controlling variable costs have consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business. Part of the year-over-year revenue growth from yield in 2013 is attributable to the new regulatory cost recovery fee that we instituted in April 2013 to help us recover a portion of the significant regulatory costs and fees, such as host fees and disposal taxes, which have not been recouped by our pricing programs. This new fee contributed approximately $43 million to our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2013, principally in our collection business, with the most significant impact in our commercial collection line of business. Additionally, revenue growth from yield in our industrial line of business was aided by our continued expansion in the Energy Service business, which typically has higher average rates due to extended transportation distances, special waste handling costs and higher disposal costs. With respect to our residential line of business, we are focused on bidding on contracts that improve our yield performance and increase our overall returns. Our effort to increase yield in our residential line of business is a challenge due principally to a very competitive environment. A high percentage of our residential business is in municipal franchise markets, and many municipalities are facing significant budget challenges, which results in very competitive bid processes as we rebid contracts and try to win new contracts. Finally, yield growth from our landfill and transfer station operations also increased for both 2013 and 2012. Improving yield in our landfill business has proved to be a challenge, due, in part, to excess disposal capacity that exists in many of the markets in which we own or operate landfills. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The expiration and renegotiation of two long-term waste-to-energy disposal contracts in South Florida at lower rates negatively impacted our revenue growth from yield in our waste-to-energy line of business by $6 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The year-over-year negative impact from the renegotiated contracts will continue through the first half of 2014. Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in average yield on collection and disposal, totaled $344 million in both 2013 and 2012 and $303 million in 2011. Revenue increase from environmental fees flattened, as we did not implement fee increases in 2013 commensurate with the prior year. Additionally, as mentioned above, we instituted a new regulatory cost recovery fee in April 2013 that contributed approximately $43 million to revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2013. Recycling commodities — Year-over-year commodity price declines of approximately 5% and 25% resulted in decreased revenues of $79 million and $428 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The estimated negative impact on income from operations was approximately $20 million and $130 million for years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, increased by $32 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. Although we experienced lower year-over-year average fuel prices in 2013, our fuel surcharge revenues increased as a result of a revision of the surcharge calculation implemented to better capture price increases intended to be recovered by the surcharge. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. Volume — Changes in our volume caused our revenue to decrease $133 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. This is a notable decrease when compared to our revenue increase on account of volume of $67 million, or 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our volume fluctuations are generally attributable to economic conditions, pricing changes, competition and diversion of waste by customers. Our collection business experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in both periods presented. Collection business revenue declines due to lower volumes were $170 million for 2013 and $65 million in 2012. Our more aggressive pricing strategy during 2013 was a significant contributor to the higher volume declines. Other drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for the periods presented include: Ÿ Strategic accounts — We experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes associated with the loss of certain strategic accounts including certain large retail mall customers in 2013. Ÿ Hurricane Sandy — The $26 million of revenues resulting from the Hurricane Sandy cleanup efforts in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily in the landfill line of business, negatively affected our year-over-year volume change for the year ended December 31, 2013 while favorably affecting volume in 2012. Ÿ Higher landfill volumes — We experienced higher landfill volumes in both comparable periods. In 2013, higher landfill volumes were primarily driven by our municipal solid waste business while higher special waste volumes in the eastern and mid-western parts of the country were the principal contributor to our higher landfill volumes in 2012. Ÿ Recycling commodities — Revenues increased from year-over-year volume growth in our recycling brokerage business and our material recovery facilities for both 2013 and 2012. The additional recycling capacity that we added in 2011 and 2012 contributed to this increase in revenues due to volume. Acquisitions — Revenues increased $292 million and $535 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to acquisitions. In 2013, the revenue increase due to acquisition was principally associated with the acquisition of Greenstar, which is reported in our “Recycling” line of business, and the acquisition of RCI, which is reported primarily in our “Collection” line of business. In 2012, the significant revenue increase due to acquisitions was principally associated with Oakleaf, included in our “Other” business, 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements which anniversaried in July 2012. Additionally, in 2012, acquisitions increased our revenues in our collection line of business, due in part to our Energy Service and recycling lines of business. These acquisitions demonstrate our focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities in new, complementary lines of business. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses increased $233 million, or 2.6%, when comparing 2013 with 2012 and increased $338 million, or 4.0%, when comparing 2012 with 2011. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 65.2% in 2013, 65.1% in 2012 and 63.8% in 2011. The increases in our operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 can largely be attributed to the following: Acquisitions — During the three years ended December 31, 2013, we made three acquisitions that were the most significant drivers of our operating expense increases. In January 2013, we acquired Greenstar, an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. The acquisition primarily increased cost of goods sold and, to a lesser extent, labor and related benefits and other categories. In July 2013, we acquired RCI, a waste management company comprised of collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations. The acquisition increased operating costs, primarily in subcontractor costs and, to a lesser extent, cost of goods sold. The Oakleaf acquisition contributed to higher operating costs in 2012 when compared to the prior year period, primarily impacting subcontractor costs. The increase in operating expenses was incurred in connection with the related acquisition revenues discussed above in Operating Revenues. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2013 Period-to-Period Change 2012 Period-to-Period Change 2011 Labor and related benefits $ 2,506 $ 99 4.1 % $ 2,407 $ 71 3.0 % $ 2,336 Transfer and disposal costs 973 9 0.9 964 27 2.9 937 Maintenance and repairs 1,181 24 2.1 1,157 67 6.1 1,090 Subcontractor costs 1,182 (8 ) (0.7 ) 1,190 242 25.5 948 Cost of goods sold 1,000 81 8.8 919 (152 ) (14.2 ) 1,071 Fuel 603 (46 ) (7.1 ) 649 21 3.3 628 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 653 23 3.7 630 28 4.7 602 Landfill operating costs 232 8 3.6 224 (31 ) (12.2 ) 255 Risk management 244 14 6.1 230 8 3.6 222 Other 538 29 5.7 509 57 12.6 452 $ 9,112 $ 233 2.6 % $ 8,879 $ 338 4.0 % $ 8,541 Significant changes in our operating expenses are discussed below. Ÿ Labor and related benefits — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2013 and the effect of acquisitions, particularly the Greenstar acquisition in 2013; Ÿ Incentive compensation expense fluctuations due to higher anticipated payouts for 2013 as compared to the prior year period and lower payouts for 2012 as compared to 2011; Ÿ Increased contract labor in both 2013 and 2012 principally attributed to the recycling line of business; Ÿ Headcount, exclusive of acquisitions, decreased in 2013 compared to the prior year period; conversely, headcount increased in 2012 when compared to 2011; and Ÿ Non-cash charges incurred during the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012 as a result of our partial withdrawals from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. Ÿ Maintenance and repairs — The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by (i) the Greenstar acquisition and (ii) higher internal shop labor costs due in part to higher incentive compensation and merit increases. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to (i) increased fleet maintenance costs, which include services provided by third-parties, tires, parts and internal shop labor costs and (ii) differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy facilities. Ÿ Subcontractor costs — The decrease in 2013 was driven primarily by the volume decline associated with the loss of certain strategic accounts. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher costs associated with the acquired RCI operations. The increase in 2012 was driven in part by (i) the acquisition of Oakleaf in July 2011 and (ii) increased volumes related to Hurricane Sandy. Ÿ Cost of goods sold — The increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 is due in large part to higher customer rebates resulting from higher volumes in our recycling commodity business driven primarily by the acquired Greenstar operations. The significantly reduced market prices for recyclable commodities in 2012 drove the majority of the cost decrease when compared to the prior period. Ÿ Fuel — The decrease in fuel expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to (i) a retroactive CNG fuel excise tax credit recognized in the first quarter of 2013; (ii) reduced fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes; (iii) lower costs as we convert our fleet to CNG vehicles and (iv) lower diesel fuel prices. The increase in fuel expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly driven by higher diesel fuel prices. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — The increase in costs in both 2013 and 2012 can be attributable to higher disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes. The current period increase was also driven by (i) higher municipal franchise fees relating to the collection line of business and (ii) a disposal surcharge at one of our waste-to-energy facilities. A host fee increase in 2012 contributed to the unfavorable variance when compared to the prior year. Ÿ Landfill operating costs — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ Higher leachate costs caused by increased precipitation in several of our Areas for all comparable periods; Ÿ Favorable adjustments in 2013 and unfavorable adjustments in both 2012 and 2011 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets; and Ÿ A favorable remediation adjustment in 2012. Ÿ Other — The increased costs in 2013 when compared to 2012 were driven in part by (i) higher telecommunications costs driven by our initiative to equip our fleet with onboard computers; (ii) higher utilities; (iii) higher property taxes and (iv) lower gains on the sale of assets. These increases were offset, in part, by favorable adjustments to contingent consideration associated with the Greenstar acquisition. The increase in costs in 2012 when compared to the prior period was driven in part by (i) costs associated with a 2012 labor union dispute in the Seattle Area; (ii) increased oil and gas development expense in 2012 and (iii) higher rental costs in 2012, primarily associated with Oakleaf. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4 million, or 0.3%, and decreased by $79 million, or 5.1%, when comparing 2013 with 2012 and 2012 with 2011, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.5% in 2013, 10.8% in 2012 and 11.6% in 2011. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2013 Period-to-Period Change 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Labor and related benefits $ 931 $ 81 9.5 % $ 850 $ (63 ) (6.9 )% $ 913 Professional fees 131 (32 ) (19.6 ) 163 (22 ) (11.9 ) 185 Provision for bad debts 41 (19 ) (31.7 ) 60 13 27.7 47 Other 365 (34 ) (8.5 ) 399 (7 ) (1.7 ) 406 $ 1,468 $ (4 ) (0.3 )% $ 1,472 $ (79 ) (5.1 )% $ 1,551 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Labor and related benefits — Factors affecting the year-over-year changes in our labor and related benefits costs include: Ÿ Higher incentive compensation costs of $94 million in 2013 and $73 million in 2011, as compared with 2012, as a result of higher anticipated payouts. Ÿ Higher non-cash compensation expense recognized in 2013 as compared to 2012, in part due to the payout of performance share units granted in 2010, which was approved in 2013. Expense associated with these awards had been reversed in 2012 when it no longer appeared probable that threshold performance would be achieved. Ÿ Cost savings of $45 million in 2013 driven primarily from our July 2012 restructuring. Professional fees — Consulting fees declined year over year as company-wide initiatives, which began in 2011, were implemented; partially offset by higher legal fees in 2012 as compared with 2013 and 2011. Provision for bad debts — Our provision for bad debts decreased in 2013 as a result of the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our Puerto Rico operations. Additionally, many of the billing delay issues we experienced throughout fiscal year 2012 with certain of our strategic account customers have been resolved, favorably affecting our year-over-year bad debt comparisons. Other — In 2013, controllable costs associated with (i) building and equipment; (ii) advertising; (iii) computer and telecommunication; (iv) travel and entertainment and (v) seminars and education have declined primarily as a result of our July 2012 restructuring and continued focus on cost-control initiatives. In 2012, we experienced decreases in (i) litigation settlement costs and (ii) insurance and claims. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (i) computer and telecommunications costs, due in part to improvements we are making to our information technology systems and (ii) building and equipment costs, which include rental and utilities. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 853 $ 20 2.4 % $ 833 $ 33 4.1 % $ 800 Amortization of landfill airspace 400 5 1.3 395 17 4.5 378 Amortization of intangible assets 80 11 15.9 69 18 35.3 51 $ 1,333 $ 36 2.8 % $ 1,297 $ 68 5.5 % $ 1,229 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2013 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of RCI. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2012 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of Oakleaf in 2011 and by our Areas located in the Northern U.S. Restructuring During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a total of $18 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI and our 2012 restructurings. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. We do not expect to incur any material charges associated with our past restructuring efforts in future periods. In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. Principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including positions at both the management and support level. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a total of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $56 million were primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with our July 2012 restructuring. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. Goodwill Impairments During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $509 million of goodwill impairment charges, primarily related to (i) $483 million associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $10 million associated with our Puerto Rico operations and (iii) $9 million associated with a majority-owned waste diversion technology company. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $4 million and $1 million, respectively, related to certain of our non-Solid Waste operations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (Income) expense from divestitures $ (8 ) $ — $ 1 Asset impairments 472 79 8 $ 464 $ 79 $ 9 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized net charges of $464 million, primarily related to the following: Ÿ Landfill impairments — We recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in some cases, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. Ÿ Waste-to-energy impairments — We recognized $144 million of impairment charges relating to three waste-to-energy facilities, primarily as a result of closure or anticipated closure due to continued difficulty securing sufficient volumes to operate the plants at capacity and the prospect of additional capacity entering the market where the largest facility is located. We wrote down the carrying value of our facilities to their estimated fair value using a market approach. Ÿ Other impairments — The remainder of our 2013 charges were attributable to (i) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (ii) $20 million of charges to write down assets related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company and (iii) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair value. Ÿ Divestitures — Partially offsetting these charges were $8 million of net gains on divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $79 million, attributable to (i) $45 million of charges related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities; (ii) $20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and (iii) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values, all of which are individually immaterial. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized impairment charges relating to two facilities in our medical waste services business, in addition to the three facilities impaired in 2012 discussed above, as a result of the closure of one site and continuing operating losses at the other site. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. In addition to the impairments discussed above, we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of underperforming assets or assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives. Accordingly, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become held-for-sale. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2013 Period-to-PeriodChange 2012 Period-to-PeriodChange 2011 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 852 $ 1 0.1 % $ 851 $ (8 ) (0.9 )% $ 859 Tier 2 1,291 21 1.7 1,270 33 2.7 1,237 Tier 3 291 (213 ) (42.3 ) 504 (8 ) (1.6 ) 512 Solid Waste 2,434 (191 ) (7.3 ) 2,625 17 0.7 2,608 Wheelabrator (517 ) (630 ) * 113 (59 ) (34.3 ) 172 Other (171 ) 71 (29.3 ) (242 ) (78 ) 47.6 (164 ) Corporate and other (667 ) (22 ) 3.4 (645 ) (57 ) 9.7 (588 ) Total $ 1,079 $ (772 ) (41.7 )% $ 1,851 $ (177 ) (8.7 )% $ 2,028 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Items affecting the comparability of our results of operations during 2013 and 2012 include (i) restructuring charges recognized in 2012 associated with our July 2012 restructuring; (ii) subsequent benefits realized as a result of our July 2012 restructuring and ongoing cost containment efforts; (iii) increased labor costs due to merit increases effective in 2013 and 2011 and (iv) lower 2012 year-over-year incentive compensation payouts. Also affecting comparability, excluding Wheelabrator, was the reclassification of employees to Solid Waste from Other and Corporate and Other. Solid Waste — Our Solid Waste business income from operations declined $191 million when comparing 2013 with 2012, principally as a result of $279 million of net charges primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013. The most significant impairment charges were in our Eastern Canada Area, which is included in Tier 3, and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. Other significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2013 are summarized below: Ÿ Our base business benefited from (i) internal revenue growth, principally in our collection and disposal business and (ii) increased fuel cost recovery in 2013. These favorable variances were offset, in part, by net cost increases mainly driven by higher operating expenses including maintenance and repair and transfer and disposal in 2012; Ÿ Results from our recycling business were lower compared to prior year periods due primarily to (i) lower prices for commodities primarily affecting the 2012 period; (ii) higher processing costs driven in part by increased outbound quality control in 2013 and (iii) operating losses related to the acquired operations of Greenstar in 2013; Ÿ The accretive benefits of the RCI acquisition; Ÿ A decrease in bad debt expense during 2013 due primarily to the collection of receivables previously reserved during 2012, principally in Puerto Rico, which is included in Tier 3; Ÿ A charge for the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan in New England in 2012, which is included in Tier 2; Ÿ Incremental operating expenses due to a labor union dispute in the Pacific Northwest Area in 2012, which is included in Tier 3; and Ÿ A charge associated with a litigation loss in Southern California in 2011, which is included in Tier 2. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Wheelabrator — The decrease in income from operations of our Wheelabrator business for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 was largely driven by (i) $627 million of pre-tax charges to impair goodwill and certain waste-to-energy facilities as discussed above in Goodwill Impairments and (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items; (iii) higher labor costs and (iv) a disposal surcharge at one of our waste-to-energy facilities. The impact of these unfavorable items was offset, in part, by improved energy pricing and metal sales. The decrease in income from operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 was largely driven by (i) lower revenues due to the expiration of long-term contracts at certain of our waste-to-energy facilities; (ii) lower energy pricing at our merchant facilities; (iii) increased maintenance and repair costs, primarily due to differences in the timing and scope of planned maintenance activities and (iv) increased international development costs. Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) those elements of our in-plant services, landfill gas-to-energy operations, and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Sustainability Services and Renewable Energy organizations, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and (iii) the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of (i) non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business and (ii) reclasses to include the costs of our former geographic Group offices that, prior to our 2012 restructuring, were included in our operating segments. Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ Impairment charges recognized in 2013 and 2012 as discussed in Goodwill Impairments, Asset Impairments, (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items, Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities and Other, net; Ÿ Improved results from our organics and medical waste service businesses in 2013; Ÿ Losses in 2013 and 2012 from our efforts to integrate our strategic accounts business with Oakleaf, including the loss of certain strategic accounts. However, in 2013, we have experienced year-over-year improvements as a result of our system and process enhancements; and Ÿ A favorable adjustment to contingent consideration associated with the Greenstar acquisition, offset by higher administrative and restructuring costs associated with the acquired operations. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include: Ÿ Lower year-over-year professional fees primarily due to higher consulting fees incurred during 2012 and 2011 in connection with the start-up phase of our cost savings programs; Ÿ Favorable adjustments in 2013 and unfavorable adjustments in both 2012 and 2011 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets; Ÿ Favorable adjustments to our estimated environmental remediation obligations in 2013 and 2011; and Ÿ Higher year-over-year risk management expense in 2013 and 2012, primarily due to increased overall costs associated with auto and general liability insurance. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $481 million in 2013, $488 million in 2012 and $481 million in 2011. During 2013, our debt balances increased by approximately $300 million, which can generally be attributed to the debt financing of our acquisition of RCI offset by debt repayments. In spite of this increase in debt, we reduced our interest costs by (i) reducing the interest rate periods of some of our tax-exempt bonds, allowing us to benefit 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements from lower rates available for shorter-term remarketings; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and (iii) reducing the cost of our revolving credit facility by amending the credit agreement to provide for lower fees and rates. The increase in interest expense from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher average debt balances, which were incurred to support acquisitions and investments in our long-term growth, and a decrease in the benefits provided by active and terminated interest rate swap agreements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest due to (i) a decline in our weighted average borrowing rate achieved by refinancing matured debt with new borrowings at much lower fixed interest rates and (ii) the impacts that lower market interest rates had on the cost of certain of our tax-exempt debt. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of $34 million in 2013, $46 million in 2012 and $31 million in 2011. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility, as well as (i) noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. The decrease in 2013 is primarily attributable to the recognition of a $10 million charge in 2012 related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an unconsolidated entity that went into liquidation. This investment was accounted for under the equity method. Other, net We recognized other, net expense of $74 million, $18 million and $4 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The expense in 2013 was impacted by impairment charges of $71 million relating to other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down the carrying value of our investments to their fair value, which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections obtained in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities. Partially offsetting these charges was a $4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment. The expense in 2012 was impacted by an impairment charge of $16 million related to an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment in a waste diversion technology company accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down the carrying value of our investment to its fair value based on other third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities, which are considered to be the best evidence of fair value currently available. The remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $364 million in 2013, $443 million in 2012 and $511 million in 2011. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 73.8%, 34.0%, and 33.6% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) federal tax credits ; (iii) tax audit settlements; (iv) the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards and (v) the tax implications of impairments. The impacts of these items are summarized below: Ÿ Investment in Refined Coal Facility — Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $20 million, $21 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal facility investment. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties — Our low-income housing investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $38 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our low-income housing investment. Ÿ Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $11 million, $10 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Ÿ State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards — During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $16 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively. Ÿ Federal Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards — During 2012, we recognized additional federal net operating loss carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $8 million. Ÿ Tax Implications of Impairments — During 2013 and 2012, the recording of impairments and the related income tax impacts resulted in permanent differences which increased our provision for income taxes by $235 million and $7 million, respectively. See Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to asset impairments and unusual items. We expect our 2014 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 35.0% based on projected income levels, federal tax credits and other permanent items. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2014 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2013 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2013. However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions decreased our 2013 cash taxes by approximately $70 million. Taking the accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions for these capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $32 million in 2013, $43 million in 2012 and $48 million in 2011. These amounts are principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the consolidation of these variable interest entities. The decrease in 2013 is primarily due to the net loss of $10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the $20 million impairment charge related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 262 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2013 and 264 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Remaining cubic yards 4,839 279 5,118 4,778 592 5,370 Remaining tonnage 4,769 282 5,051 4,558 612 5,170 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2013 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 25 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2013, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 9 12 29 63 96 209 Operated through lease(a) 6 3 4 2 7 22 Operating contracts(b) 11 5 7 5 8 36 Total landfills 26 20 40 70 111 267 (a) Landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance, beginning of year 4,558 612 5,170 4,485 621 5,106 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 22 — 22 82 — 82 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 33 33 — 9 9 Expansion permits granted(b) 364 (364 ) — 40 (40 ) — Airspace consumed (93 ) — (93 ) (92 ) — (92 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) (82 ) 1 (81 ) 43 22 65 Balance, end of year 4,769 282 5,051 4,558 612 5,170 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at 12 of our landfills during 2013 and six of our landfills during 2012, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2013 and 2012 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2013 2012 # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay Solid waste landfills 262 (a) 93,804 345 264 92,393 338 Hazardous waste landfills. 5 568 2 5 640 2 267 94,372 347 269 93,033 340 Solid waste landfills closed or divested during related year 5 390 1 189 94,762 (b) 93,222 (b) (a) In 2013, we acquired five landfills (two of which were previously operated through lease arrangements), closed four landfills and our contract expired at one landfill. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (b) These amounts include 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2013 and 1.3 million tons at December 31, 2012, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2013, our closed sites management group managed 212 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2013 (in millions): Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2012 $ 13,266 $ (7,188 ) $ 6,078 Capital additions 397 — 397 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 59 — 59 Acquisitions 88 — 88 Amortization of landfill airspace — (400 ) (400 ) Foreign currency translation (96 ) 27 (69 ) Asset retirements and other adjustments (298 ) 43 (255 ) December 31, 2013 $ 13,416 $ (7,518 ) $ 5,898 As of December 31, 2013, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2014, and approximately $800 million in 2015 and 2016 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2013 (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2012 $ 1,338 $ 253 Obligations incurred and capitalized 59 — Obligations settled (71 ) (20 ) Interest accretion 87 4 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions 6 (6 ) Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 2 (4 ) December 31, 2013 $ 1,421 $ 227 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 87 $ 84 $ 84 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets (9 ) 6 23 Leachate and methane collection and treatment 77 67 76 Landfill remediation costs 9 — — Other landfill site costs 68 67 72 Total landfill operating costs $ 232 $ 224 $ 255 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: Ÿ the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and Ÿ the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 400 $ 395 $ 378 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 93 92 90 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.29 $ 4.30 $ 4.19 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 267 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments, and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): 2013 2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 58 $ 194 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 125 $ 125 Tax-exempt bond funds 27 1 Other 15 12 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 167 $ 138 Debt: Current portion $ 726 $ 743 Long-term portion 9,500 9,173 Total debt $ 10,226 $ 9,916 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 59 $ 79 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash and cash equivalents have decreased as a result of the execution of our strategic growth plans, primarily due to acquisitions. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. These balances are primarily included within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2013 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2012 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt borrowings of $155 million and (ii) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to tax-exempt bond issuances, hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, interest accretion and capital leases and other debt obligations. As of December 31, 2013, we had (i) $481 million of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including $350 million of 5.0% senior notes that mature in March 2014 and $67 million of tax-exempt bonds; (ii) short-term borrowings and advances outstanding under credit facilities with long-term maturities, including $420 million of borrowings outstanding under the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and $9 million of advances under our Canadian credit facility and (iii) $939 million of tax-exempt borrowings subject to repricing within the next 12 months. Based on our intent and ability to refinance a portion of this debt on a long-term basis as of December 31, 2013, including through use of forecasted available capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, we have classified $1.1 billion of this debt as long-term and the remaining $726 million as current obligations. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2013 2012 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 872 $ 933 Letter of credit facilities(b) 400 492 Other(c) 267 257 $ 1,539 $ 1,682 (a) In July 2013, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, increasing our total credit capacity to $2.25 billion and extending the term through July 2018. At December 31, 2013, we had $420 million of outstanding borrowings and $872 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $958 million. (b) As of December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $400 million under letter of credit facilities with terms extending through December 2016. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of December 31, 2013. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,455 $ 2,295 $ 2,469 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,900 ) $ (1,830 ) $ (2,185 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (687 ) $ (530 ) $ (566 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2013 as compared with 2012 are summarized below: Ÿ Earnings change — Our 2013 earnings drove our improved net cash provided by operating activities in spite of a year-over-year decrease in income from operations, of $772 million. Our income from operations decline resulted from higher non-cash charges during 2013 of $949 million, associated principally with higher impairment charges. Absent these non-cash charges, we experienced higher earnings, which resulted in cash flow expansion. Ÿ Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $144 million higher on a year-over-year basis. Note that, while pre-tax income on a year-over-year basis has declined $809 million, a significant portion of the 2013 impairments discussed above do not qualify for a tax benefit. Ÿ Forward starting swaps — During the third quarter of 2012, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances were terminated contemporaneously with the actual issuance of senior notes in September 2012, and we paid cash of $59 million to settle the liabilities related to the swap agreements. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Other liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Termination of interest rate swaps — In April 2012, we elected to terminate our $1 billion interest rate swap portfolio associated with senior notes that were scheduled to mature from November 2012 through March 2018. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $72 million in cash for their fair value. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in “Other assets” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted in 2013 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Additionally, accruals for our annual incentive plan favorably affected our working capital comparison, driven by both higher incentive plan expense accruals in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower incentive plan payments in 2013 as compared to 2012. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2012 as compared with 2011 are summarized below: Ÿ Decrease in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $109 million, on a year-over-year basis. Included in the $109 million decrease are the following items: Ÿ higher charges in 2012 related to impairments and restructuring costs of $89 million and $48 million, respectively; Ÿ lower non-cash charges attributable to equity-based compensation expense and interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets of $16 million and $17 million, respectively; and 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ lower bonus expense of approximately $90 million in 2012 when compared with 2011. Ÿ Increased income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $63 million higher on a year-over-year basis as a result of the decrease in the bonus depreciation allowance from a deduction of 100% of qualifying capital expenditures for property placed in service in 2011 to a deduction of 50% of qualifying capital expenditures for property placed in service in 2012. See Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items below for additional information. Ÿ Forward starting swaps — During the first quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2012, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances were terminated contemporaneously with the actual issuance of senior notes in February 2011 and September 2012, and we paid cash of $9 million and $59 million, respectively, to settle the liabilities related to these swap agreements. These cash payments have been classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Termination of interest rate swaps — In April 2012, we elected to terminate our $1 billion interest rate swap portfolio associated with senior notes that were scheduled to mature from November 2012 through March 2018. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $72 million in cash for their fair value. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in “Other assets” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Ÿ Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted in 2012 by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Capital expenditures — We used $1,271 million during 2013 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,510 million in 2012 and $1,324 million in 2011. The decrease can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management. The increase in capital expenditures in 2012 and 2011 is a result of our increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure, and information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as our taking advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation. The year-over-year comparison of 2013 with 2012 was also affected by timing differences associated with cash payments for the previous years’ fourth quarter capital spending. Approximately $171 million of our fourth quarter 2012 spending was paid in cash in the first quarter of 2013 compared with approximately $244 million of our fourth quarter 2011 spending that was paid in the first quarter of 2012. Ÿ Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $138 million in 2013, $44 million in 2012 and $36 million in 2011. These divestitures were made as part of our initiative to improve or divest certain underperforming and non-strategic operations. In 2013, our proceeds from divestitures included approximately $41 million related to investments in oil and gas producing properties and $14 million related to certain of our medical waste service operations and a transfer station in our Greater Mid-Atlantic Area. The remaining amount reported for 2013, as well as the proceeds in 2012 and 2011, generally relate to the sale of fixed assets. Ÿ Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $724 million in 2013 compared with $250 million in 2012 and $867 million in 2011. In 2013, our acquisitions consisted primarily of the recycling operations of Greenstar, for which we paid $170 million, and substantially all of the assets of RCI, for which we paid $481 million. The remainder of our 2013 acquisitions related to collection and energy services operations. In 2012, our acquisitions consisted primarily of interests in oil and gas producing properties acquired 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements through two transactions, for which we paid $94 million. In 2011, we paid $432 million, net of cash received of $4 million and inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Oakleaf, which provides outsourced waste and recycling services. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. Ÿ Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $33 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2013, compared with $77 million in 2012 and $155 million in 2011. In 2013, our investments primarily related to waste diversion technology companies and additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility discussed below. In 2012, our investments primarily related to furthering our goal of expanding our service offerings and developing waste diversion technologies. In 2011, our investments included a $48 million payment made to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company, which was established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility in North Dakota, and $107 million of investments primarily related to furthering our goal of growing into new markets by investing in greener technologies. Ÿ Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $71 million to our investing activities in 2013 compared with $14 million in 2012 and $107 million in 2011. The significant decrease in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2012 was due to a decrease in tax-exempt borrowings. Ÿ Other — Net cash used by our other investing activities of $81 million during 2013 and $51 million during 2012 was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in Europe. Net cash provided by our other investing activities of $18 million during 2011 was primarily related to the receipt of a payment of $17 million associated with a note receivable from a prior year divestiture. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Ÿ Share repurchases and dividend payments — For the periods presented, all share repurchases and dividend payments have been approved by our Board of Directors. We paid an aggregate of $683 million in cash dividends during 2013, compared with $658 million in 2012, and $637 million in 2011. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.34 in 2011, to $0.355 in 2012, and to $0.365 in 2013 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2011 and 2013 as a result of our share repurchase programs. We paid $239 million and $575 million for share repurchases in 2013 and 2011, respectively. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares of our common stock in 2013 and approximately 17 million shares of our common stock in 2011. We did not repurchase any shares during 2012. In February 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.365 to $0.375 per share for dividends declared in 2014. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Additionally, in December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases, and we repurchased $239 million of our common stock pursuant to that authorization in 2013. In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized up to $600 million in future share repurchases; this authorization both replaces and increases the amount that remained available for share repurchases under the prior authorization. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ÿ Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $132 million of financing cash inflows during 2013 compared with $43 million during 2012 and $45 million during 2011. The increase in exercised stock options during 2013 is primarily due to the increase in the Company’s stock price combined with exercises in advance of stock option expiration dates. Ÿ Debt borrowings (repayments) — Net debt borrowings were $155 million, $122 million and $698 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following summarizes our cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Borrowings: U.S. revolving credit facility(a) $ 325 $ 400 $ 150 Canadian credit facility(a) 897 189 137 Senior notes — 495 893 Capital leases and other debt 85 96 21 $ 1,307 $ 1,180 $ 1,201 Repayments: U.S. revolving credit facility(a) $ (305 ) $ (150 ) $ — Canadian credit facility(a) (556 ) (257 ) (214 ) Senior notes — (400 ) (147 ) Tax-exempt bonds (162 ) (129 ) (55 ) Capital leases and other debt (129 ) (122 ) (87 ) $ (1,152 ) $ (1,058 ) $ (503 ) Net borrowings $ 155 $ 122 $ 698 (a) Due to the short-term maturities of the borrowings under these credit facilities, we have reported certain of these cash flows on a net basis. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011, non-cash activities included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds, of $99 million and $100 million, respectively. During 2012, we did not have any significant non-cash activities. Ÿ Other — Net cash used in other financing activities was $3 million, $2 million and $46 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These activities are primarily attributable to changes in our accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash balances due to the timing of cash deposits or payments. During 2013 and 2011, the cash used for these activities included $4 million and $7 million, respectively, of financing costs paid to amend and restate our U.S. revolving credit facility. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities:(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 95 $ 131 $ 111 $ 107 $ 115 $ 2,110 $ 2,669 Environmental remediation 35 23 32 24 14 106 234 130 154 143 131 129 2,216 2,903 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 916 491 704 731 793 6,631 10,266 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 100 86 64 55 46 393 744 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 76 44 25 17 9 231 402 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2013 $ 1,222 $ 775 $ 936 $ 934 $ 977 $ 9,471 $ 14,315 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2013 include $939 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items Bonus Depreciation — The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013 and included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2014 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2013 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2013 although it reduced our cash taxes. The acceleration of depreciation deductions related to qualifying capital expenditures in 2013 decreased our 2013 cash taxes by approximately $70 million. However, taking accelerated depreciation deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the depreciation deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Overall, the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs results in increased cash taxes of $40 million in 2013. Separately, our tax payments in 2013 were $145 million higher than the tax payments made in 2012. Uncertain Tax Positions — We have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We anticipate that approximately $9 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and $3 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals are related to state tax items, none of which are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2013, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our income from operations margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2013, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2013, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2013, we had $10.2 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $2.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2014. The most significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $577 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $939 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months; (iii) $420 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (iv) $414 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian credit facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2014 interest expense by approximately $19 million. As of December 31, 2012, the effective interest rates of approximately $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. In addition, at December 31, 2013, we had forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $175 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately $600 million at December 31, 2013. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. With the exception of electricity commodity derivatives, which are discussed below, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities during the three years ended December 31, 2013. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. During 2013, approximately 56% of the electricity revenue at our waste-to-energy facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently expect that nearly 62% of our electricity revenues at our waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2014. Our exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices for electricity has increased over the last few years as long-term power purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed, and we have found that the current market structure does not support medium- and long-term electricity contracts. As we renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more substantial portion of our energy sales at our waste-to-energy facilities will be based on variable market rates. Accordingly, in recent years, we implemented a more actively managed energy program, which includes a hedging strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to market prices for electricity. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our electricity commodity derivatives. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as a cost center in India and investments in China, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives. The foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 20:44:58.567211
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview for more information on our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following: • Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively. • A key element of our strategy is yield management through focus on price leadership, which has presented challenges to keep existing business and win new business at reasonable returns. We have also continued our environmental fee and fuel surcharge programs to offset costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases and our unwillingness to pursue lower margin volumes may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. • We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result. • We may not be able to maintain cost savings achieved through restructuring efforts. • Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. • Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions. • Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others. • Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. • Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans. • We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Compliance with existing or future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures. Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as: • limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities; 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; • limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; • mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or • limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations. We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility, or EPR, are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. If Operation Green Fence or other similar initiatives or 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements new regulations increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices. Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and plastics, which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities, particularly demand from Chinese paper mills, can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively, such as we experienced in 2015, 2014 and 2013. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The decline in market prices in 2015, 2014 and 2013 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $138 million, $53 million and $79 million, respectively. Additionally, under some agreements, our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers. In some cases, if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. As we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall until market conditions improve. Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our Energy Services business. Demand for these services may decrease if drilling activity slows due to changes in oil and gas prices, such as the pronounced price decreases in late 2014 and 2015. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future. Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our Energy Services business. Energy Services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste, and electronics at landfills. Where such organic waste is not 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested waste-to-energy facilities, have historically provided our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives. Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives. If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer. Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies. Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which: • agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and • local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments. Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in China could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results. We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, we had $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $316 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses. The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we recently agreed on settlement terms for two cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we may face similar claims in the future. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices. We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. However, natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. It will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program. We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage. Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions. Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans. We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from multiemployer pension plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized related expenses of $51 million in 2015, $4 million in 2014 and $5 million in 2013. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters. There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface chemical reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. We also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense. We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities. The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile. If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have $911 million of debt as of December 31, 2015 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$150 million Canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2020 and November 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $20 million of outstanding borrowings and $831 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,399 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate. Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and “one-time” special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins. For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations. Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties. Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity. We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations. Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 366,000 square feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states. We also have operations in the District of Columbia and throughout Canada. Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with our strategic growth plans.

Cash dividends declared and paid were $695 million in 2015, or $1.54 per common share, $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share, and $683 million in 2013, or $1.46 per common share. In December 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.385 to $0.41 per share for dividends declared in 2016. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Our share repurchases have also been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We announced in February 2015 that the Board of Directors authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. During the second and third quarters of 2015, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. We received a total of 12 million shares pursuant to these ASR agreements with a final weighted average per share price of $49.83. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company entered into an additional ASR agreement in December 2015 to repurchase $150 million of our common stock in early 2016. We subsequently announced in December 2015 that the Board of Directors refreshed its prior authorization of up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address, and anticipate, the current, expanding and evolving needs of our customers. Accomplishment of our goals will grow our Company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they, too, Think Green®. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Drawing on our resources and experience, we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve and the environment. We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy: to know and service our customers better than anyone in our industry, to extract more value from the materials we manage, and to innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from operational improvements and focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations. In pursuit of these long-term goals, we recognize that we must grow the business, and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Accordingly, we are focusing on the following five key company priorities: • Customers: provide the best possible service to our customers; • Traditional Waste Business: continuously improve our operational performance; • Growth: take advantage of opportunities in our current business, as well as considering attractive acquisition opportunities; • Yield Management: remain focused on price leadership while considering competitive dynamics; and • Costs: minimize both operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic industry. Notable items of our 2015 financial results include: • Revenues of $12,961 million in 2015 compared with $13,996 million in 2014, a decrease of $1,035 million. This decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) divestitures, which lowered revenues by $762 million, primarily the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014; (ii) lower volumes, which decreased our revenues by $215 million; (iii) lower fuel surcharges and mandated fees of $171 million, primarily due to lower year-over-year average fuel prices; (iv) year-over-year 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recyclable commodity price declines, which lowered revenues by $138 million and (v) foreign currency translation of $126 million related to our Canadian operations. These decreases were partially offset by positive revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations of $203 million, or 1.8%, and acquisitions, which increased revenues by $174 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Deffenbaugh in March 2015; • Operating expenses of $8,231 million in 2015, or 63.5% of revenues, compared with $9,002 million, or 64.3% of revenues in 2014. This decrease of $771 million is primarily attributable to (i) operating costs associated with divestitures of $495 million, primarily the sale of our Wheelabrator business; (ii) lower fuel costs of $187 million due to lower year-over-year average fuel prices; (iii) lower cost of goods sold of $102 million, primarily associated with lower recyclable commodity prices and (iv) lower subcontractor expenses of $70 million, primarily associated with lower volumes. These decreases were partially offset by higher transfer and disposal costs of $57 million, primarily due to incurring third party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in 2014; • Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,343 million in 2015, or 10.4% of revenues, compared with $1,481 million, or 10.6% of revenues, in 2014. This decrease of $138 million is attributable to (i) savings associated with our August 2014 reorganization; (ii) divestitures, primarily the sale of our Wheelabrator business; (iii) lower incentive compensation costs and (iv) lower litigation settlement costs; • Income from operations of $2,045 million, or 15.8% of revenues, in 2015 compared with $2,299 million, or 16.4% of revenues, in 2014, a decrease of $254 million, the comparability of which was affected by asset impairments in both periods and the 2014 gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business; • Interest expense, net decreased by $81 million, or 17.4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes during 2015 discussed below; • Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $753 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for 2015, as compared with $1,298 million, or $2.79 per diluted share, for 2014, the decrease was primarily driven by the 2015 loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed below; and • In 2015, we returned $1,295 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $1,293 million in 2014. The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2015 results with 2014 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2015 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of a pre-tax loss of $555 million, primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through a make-whole redemption and cash tender offer. We replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates, which will reduce future interest expense and extend the average maturity of our debt obligations. The charges incurred for the redemption had a negative impact of $0.75 on our diluted earnings per share; • The $51 million pre-tax charge associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans had a negative $0.07 impact on our diluted earnings per share; and • Net pre-tax charges of $102 million resulting from impairments, restructuring and divestitures, of which $66 million related to the impairment of certain of our oil and gas producing properties. These items had a negative impact of $0.14 on our diluted earnings per share. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2014 results with 2013 has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2014 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of net pre-tax gains of $515 million, which includes the $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business. These items had a positive impact of $1.10 on our diluted earnings per share; • Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $420 million primarily related to (i) $272 million of charges to impair our oil and gas producing properties; (ii) $69 million of charges to impair investments related to waste diversion technology companies; (iii) $31 million of litigation settlements; (iv) $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations and (v) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values related to certain of our operations. These items had a negative impact of $0.68 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges of $82 million, which had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2013 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $1.0 billion, primarily related to (i) a $483 million charge to impair goodwill associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $262 million of charges to impair certain landfills, primarily in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) $144 million of charges to write down the carrying value of three waste-to-energy facilities and (iv) $71 million of impairment charges relating to investments in waste diversion technology companies. These items had a negative impact of $1.91 on our diluted earnings per share; and • The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $23 million primarily related to our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI as well as prior restructurings and other charges. These items had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share. In 2015, we generated strong earnings and cash flow growth from our Solid Waste business by continuing a disciplined focus on revenue growth and cost control. These results were driven by strong core pricing in each line of business; controlling costs of both our operations and corporate functions; improving customer experience by differentiating our service offerings to reduce customer churn; maintaining discipline around capital spending; and implementing a more rational and sustainable framework for recycling operations as an integrated component of solid waste services. Another priority we successfully pursued in 2015 was the investment of cash proceeds from the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in late 2014 to support our strategic growth plans. In 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”), one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest. In addition, in January 2016, we completed the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling in Southern Florida. These transactions reflect our view that we can create shareholder value by making accretive acquisitions in our Solid Waste business. As we look forward to 2016, our key priorities will remain the same — driving revenue growth from yield, maintaining our commitment to provide excellent customer service and improving our productivity while managing our costs. We believe that continued execution of these objectives will translate into earnings and cash flow growth, leaving us well positioned to continue investing in our business, pay dividends and repurchase shares, while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,498 $ 2,331 $ 2,455 Capital expenditures (1,233 ) (1,151 ) (1,271 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) 145 2,253 138 Free cash flow $ 1,410 $ 3,433 $ 1,322 When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the comparable period in 2014, the increase of $167 million is primarily related to (i) lower income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $329 million in the current year; (ii) lower interest paid of $77 million in the current year and (iii) the settlement of forward-starting swap liabilities of $36 million in 2014. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in 2014; (ii) multiemployer pension plan settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iii) higher year-over-year annual incentive plan payments of approximately $65 million. Finally, we experienced unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. However, we did experience continued improvement in both trade accounts receivable and accounts payable. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable period in 2013, the decrease of $124 million is primarily related to higher income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $242 million in 2014 and a payment of $36 million in 2014 to terminate our forward-starting swaps. These decreases were partially offset by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital changes. Although capital expenditures were higher in 2015 and 2013 as compared to 2014, the Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management. Fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities, growth in our existing business, and the timing of replacement of aging assets. The significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of (i) our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion; (ii) our investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which was part of our Wheelabrator business, for $155 million and (iii) our Puerto Rico operations for proceeds of $80 million, including $65 million in cash. Acquisitions Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. — On March 26, 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest, for total consideration of $416 million ($413 million cash), 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital. Deffenbaugh’s assets include five collection operations, seven transfer stations, two recycling facilities, one subtitle-D landfill, and one construction and demolition landfill. Greenstar, LLC — On January 31, 2013, we paid $170 million inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Greenstar, LLC (“Greenstar”). Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, up to an additional $40 million was payable to the sellers, of which $20 million was guaranteed and paid in 2015. The remaining $20 million of this consideration was contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and had an estimated fair value at closing of $16 million. This contingent consideration was not earned. Greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions, having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers. RCI Environnement, Inc. — On July 5, 2013, we paid C$509 million, or $481 million, to acquire substantially all of the assets of RCI Environnement, Inc. (“RCI”), the largest waste management company in Quebec, and certain related entities. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, was C$515 million, or $487 million. RCI provides collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec. Divestitures Wheelabrator Business — On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pre-tax basis. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets through 2021. Other — In addition to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, we also divested our Puerto Rico operations as well as certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014. In total, these divested businesses and assets provided $0.18 and $0.16 of earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Subsequent Event On January 8, 2016, Waste Management Inc. of Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling in Southern Florida. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, paid at closing was $516 million and is subject to standard post-closing adjustments. The acquisition was funded primarily with borrowings under our long-term U.S. revolving credit facility (“$2.25 billion revolving credit facility”). Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information Deferred Income Taxes — In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended authoritative guidance associated with deferred income taxes. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amended guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the statement of financial position. This eliminates the guidance to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the statement of financial position. The amendments to the authoritative guidance associated with deferred income taxes were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016; however, early adoption was permitted. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2015 was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and • Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 21 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2015, three landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. One landfill required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining two landfills required approval because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the and “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below. Landfills — The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Expansion Airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill for impairment using Level 3 inputs. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units. During our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our Wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $483 million, which had no related tax benefit. We estimated the implied fair value of our Wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches. Because the annual impairment test indicated that Wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, we performed the “step two” analysis. In the “step two” analysis, the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, power contracts, customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. The factors contributing to the $483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which Wheelabrator operated, characterized by lower available disposal volumes (which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue, as well as the amount of electricity Wheelabrator was able to generate), lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as Wheelabrator’s facilities aged. These factors caused us to lower prior assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue, and increase assumed operating costs. Additionally, the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates. In 2013, we also incurred $10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with our Puerto Rico operations. In 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Goodwill Impairments and (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues set forth below have generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. Our divested Wheelabrator business provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”), Energy and Environmental Services, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services, and expanded service offerings and solutions. In addition, we offer portable self-storage and long distance moving services through a joint venture; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let® and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below.

(b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related-business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities.

Our revenue decline was driven by (i) divestitures in 2014, principally our Wheelabrator business in December 2014, our Puerto Rico operations in the second quarter of 2014, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014; (ii) lower volumes; (iii) lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining fuel costs; (iv) lower recyclable commodity prices and (v) foreign currency translation, which affects revenues from our Canadian operations. Partially offsetting these revenue declines were (i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations and (ii) revenue from acquired operations, primarily the Deffenbaugh acquisition in March 2015. Our revenues increased $13 million, or 0.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by (i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (ii) revenue from acquired operations, particularly the RCI operations acquired in July 2013 and (iii) fluctuations in electricity prices at Wheelabrator’s merchant waste-to-energy facilities that favorably affected revenues. Offsetting these revenue increases were (i) revenue declines due to lower volumes; (ii) divestitures in 2014, primarily our Puerto Rico operations, our Wheelabrator business and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) foreign currency translation and (iv) revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices. The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues. Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $203 million, or 1.8%, and $262 million, or 2.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our year-over-year yield growth was driven largely by our continued focus on our pricing strategy with lower rollbacks and improved new business pricing. We experienced growth in all three of our principal collection lines of business in both 2015 and 2014. The details are as follows (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2015 vs. 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange2014 vs. 2013 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Commercial $ 92 3.0 % $ 134 4.3 % Industrial 55 2.7 84 4.2 Residential 39 1.6 32 1.3 $ 186 $ 250 Other drivers affecting both 2015 and 2014 average yield include: • A fee instituted to help us recover a portion of the significant regulatory costs and fees, such as host fees and disposal taxes, which are not recouped by our pricing programs. Revenues generated from this fee are approximately $113 million, $97 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally in our collection business, with the most significant impact in our commercial line of business. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Our 2014 revenue growth from yield in our industrial line of business was aided by the expansion of our oilfield services business. These services typically have higher average rates due to extended transportation distances, special waste handling costs and higher disposal costs as compared with our other industrial business. However, in 2015, reduced drilling and auxiliary activities due to the continued decline in oil and gas prices negatively affected our oilfield services business, which in turn affected our revenue growth in our industrial line of business. • In our residential line of business, we continue to focus on bidding on contracts that improve our yield performance and increase our overall returns. • Yield growth from our landfill and transfer station operations also improved for both 2015 and 2014. Recycling commodities — The continuing declines in recycling commodities prices resulted in revenue declines of $138 million and $53 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared with the prior year. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $171 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. We experienced a dramatic fuel price decline of approximately 30% in 2015 versus the 2.4% fuel price decline in 2014, which caused a much more significant decline in our fuel surcharge revenues in the current year. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. Volume — Declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease $215 million, or 1.6%, and $188 million, or 1.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as compared with the prior year. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses decreased $771 million, or 8.6%, when comparing 2015 with 2014 and decreased $110 million, or 1.2%, when comparing 2014 with 2013. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 63.5% in 2015, 64.3% in 2014, and 65.2% in 2013. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions), with significant changes in our operating expenses discussed below: 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Labor and related benefits $ 2,381 $ (71 ) (2.9 )% $ 2,452 $ (54 ) (2.2 )% $ 2,506 Transfer and disposal costs 939 4 0.4 935 (38 ) (3.9 ) 973 Maintenance and repairs 1,022 (159 ) (13.5 ) 1,181 — — 1,181 Subcontractor costs 1,137 (86 ) (7.0 ) 1,223 41 3.5 1,182 Cost of goods sold 791 (183 ) (18.8 ) 974 (26 ) (2.6 ) 1,000 Fuel 361 (192 ) (34.7 ) 553 (50 ) (8.3 ) 603 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 662 (7 ) (1.0 ) 669 16 2.5 653 Landfill operating costs 255 (11 ) (4.1 ) 266 34 14.7 232 Risk management 221 2 0.9 219 (25 ) (10.2 ) 244 Other 462 (68 ) (12.8 ) 530 (8 ) (1.5 ) 538 $ 8,231 $ (771 ) (8.6 )% $ 9,002 $ (110 ) (1.2 )% $ 9,112 Divestitures — During 2014, we divested our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. The following table lists the operating expense categories in which these divestitures have had a material impact (in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange for theYear EndedDecember 31,2015 vs. 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange for theYear EndedDecember 31,2014 vs. 2013 Maintenance and repairs $ 177 $ 13 Labor and related benefits 88 15 Costs of goods sold 81 4 Other 63 5 Transfer and disposal cost 53 5 $ 462 $ 42 In addition to the impact of divestitures noted above, other significant items by category of expense include: Labor and related benefits — The following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented: • The recognition of $51 million of net charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans; • Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarters of 2014 and 2015; • Additional costs associated with the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in 2015; • Lower headcount and contract labor due to lower volumes in our collection line of business and operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business; and • Decreased health and welfare costs in 2015 and increased health and welfare costs in 2014. Transfer and disposal costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily due to incurring third party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. These cost increases were offset, in part, by 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the reduction in costs due to the divestitures, as discussed above. The decrease in costs in 2014 were driven in part by lower volumes in the collection and recycling lines of business. Maintenance and repairs — The decrease in maintenance and repairs in 2015 was largely driven by the divestiture of Wheelabrator, which was partially offset by the increased costs related to the Deffenbaugh acquisition. Subcontractor costs — The following significant items affected the comparability of expenses for the periods presented: • Volume declines related to the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization; • Decreased costs associated with lower costs in the landfill and recycling businesses in 2015; • Higher costs related to remediation services; and • Higher costs related to the RCI operations acquired in July 2013. Cost of goods sold — The reduction in costs is primarily driven by lower recycling rebates due to (i) lower commodity prices; (ii) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers; (iii) better alignment of rebate structures with commodity prices for new recycling contracts and (iv) ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control. These cost reductions were offset, in part, by increased costs in our remediation business and increased costs in 2014 related to our portable self-storage service. Fuel — The decrease in fuel expense in 2015 and 2014 when compared to the prior periods was driven by (i) lower fuel prices; (ii) lower fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes; (iii) lower costs resulting from the conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and (iv) year-over-year increases in natural gas fuel excise credits. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include (i) increased disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes; (ii) decreased costs due to divestitures and (iii) a disposal surcharge in 2013. Landfill operating costs — Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include (i) unfavorable adjustments in 2014 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets and (ii) higher leachate costs for all comparable periods. Risk management — The decrease in costs in 2014 was primarily due to lower auto and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation claims. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $138 million, or 9.3%, when comparing 2015 with 2014 and increased $13 million, or 0.9%, when comparing 2014 with 2013. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.4% in 2015, 10.6% in 2014 and 10.5% in 2013. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Labor and related benefits $ 874 $ (59 ) (6.3 )% $ 933 $ 2 0.2 % $ 931 Professional fees 112 (14 ) (11.1 ) 126 (5 ) (3.8 ) 131 Provision for bad debts 36 (5 ) (12.2 ) 41 — — 41 Other 321 (60 ) (15.7 ) 381 16 4.4 365 $ 1,343 $ (138 ) (9.3 )% $ 1,481 $ 13 0.9 % $ 1,468 Our 2014 divestitures, primarily the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014, favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014. In addition to the impact of divestitures, other significant items by category of expense include: Labor and related benefits — Factors affecting the year-over-year changes in our labor and related benefits costs include: • Cost savings from our August 2014 reorganization, which favorably affected both periods presented; • Lower incentive compensation costs in 2015 as compared to both 2014 and 2013; and • Merit increases in both 2015 and 2014. Other — Changes in our other expenses are a result of higher litigation settlement costs in 2014 and our continued focus on controlling costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 40 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Period-to-PeriodChange 2013 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 760 $ (74 ) (8.9 )% $ 834 $ (19 ) (2.2 )% $ 853 Amortization of landfill airspace 409 29 7.6 380 (20 ) (5.0 ) 400 Amortization of intangible assets 76 (2 ) (2.6 ) 78 (2 ) (2.5 ) 80 $ 1,245 $ (47 ) (3.6 )% $ 1,292 $ (41 ) (3.1 )% $ 1,333 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 is primarily due to the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business as discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 is primarily due to increased volumes, a portion of which relates to the acquisition of Deffenbaugh. This increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates and fixed asset depreciation that was suspended when our Wheelabrator business was classified as held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in December 2014. Restructuring During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $15 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $10 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our Eastern Canada Area and our acquisition of Deffenbaugh. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a total of $18 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI and our prior restructurings. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. Goodwill Impairments During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $509 million of goodwill impairment charges, primarily related to (i) $483 million associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $10 million associated with our Puerto Rico operations and (iii) $9 million associated with a majority-owned waste diversion technology company. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (Income) expense from divestitures $ (7 ) $ (515 ) $ (8 ) Asset impairments (other than goodwill) 89 345 472 $ 82 $ (170 ) $ 464 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net charges of $82 million, primarily related to $66 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices. We wrote down the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value using an income approach. At December 31, 2015, our remaining book value in these investments was $30 million. We also recognized $18 million of charges to write down or divest of certain assets in our recycling operations and a $5 million impairment of a landfill in our Western Canada Area due to revised post-closure cost estimates. Partially offsetting these charges was $7 million in net gains from divestitures, including a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in the second quarter of 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net gains of $170 million, primarily related to the following: • Divestitures — We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our divestitures. • Oil and gas properties impairments — We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil and gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. We wrote down the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value using an income approach. • Other impairments — We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized net charges of $464 million, primarily related to the following: • Landfill impairments — We recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets. • Waste-to-energy impairments — We recognized $144 million of impairment charges relating to three waste-to-energy facilities, primarily as a result of closure or anticipated closure due to continued difficulty securing sufficient volumes to operate the plants at capacity and the prospect of additional capacity entering the market where the largest facility is located. We wrote down the carrying value of our facilities to their estimated fair value using a market approach. • Other impairments — The remainder of our 2013 charges were attributable to (i) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (ii) $20 million of charges to write down assets related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company and (iii) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair value. • Divestitures — Partially offsetting these charges were $8 million of net gains on divestitures. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. In addition to the impairments discussed above, we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives or are underperforming. Accordingly, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become held-for-sale. Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2015 Period-to-Period Change 2014 Period-to-Period Change 2013 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 1,290 $ (11 ) (0.8 )% $ 1,301 $ 55 4.4 % $ 1,246 Tier 2 629 (82 ) (11.5 ) 711 257 56.6 454 Tier 3 808 21 2.7 787 53 7.2 734 Solid Waste 2,727 (72 ) (2.6 ) 2,799 365 15.0 2,434 Wheelabrator — (669 ) * 669 1,186 * (517 ) Other (160 ) 240 (60.0 ) (400 ) (229 ) * (171 ) Corporate and other (522 ) 247 (32.1 ) (769 ) (102 ) 15.3 (667 ) Total $ 2,045 $ (254 ) (11.0 ) $ 2,299 $ 1,220 * $ 1,079 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. All information presented has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2015 are summarized below: • Our traditional Solid Waste business benefited from internal revenue growth and the impact of lower fuel prices. • Our recycling business has been negatively affected by lower market prices for recycling commodities and lower volumes. In 2014, these unfavorable drivers were offset by (i) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers; (ii) better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts and (iii) ongoing business improvement efforts around inbound quality control. In 2015, these benefits offset, in part, the impact of lower market prices, lower volumes, and impairment charges related to various recycling assets due to continued declines in commodity prices. In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014 within specific segments: • We recognized $51 million of net charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans in 2015 impacting all three tiers; • The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on the results of our Canadian operations in Tiers 1 and 2; • The unfavorable impact on our oilfield services business, primarily in Tier 2, of reduced drilling and auxiliary activities as a result of declining oil and gas prices; and • The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment in 2014. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2014 to 2013 within specific segments: • Net charges of $279 million, primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013. The most significant impairment charges were in our Eastern Canada Area, which is included in Tier 2, and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items; • The loss on the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in 2014, which were included in Tier 3 and Tier 1, respectively; • Adverse weather in the first quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected income from operations, which impacted all three tiers; • The gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014, which were included in Tier 2; • The accretive benefits of the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which are included in Tier 2; • The gain on the sale of a vacant facility in 2014, which was included in Tier 3; and • A reversal of a reserve in 2014 due to a favorable litigation resolution, which was included in Tier 1. Wheelabrator — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Wheelabrator business in 2014 and 2013 were (i) a $519 million gain on sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and (ii) $627 million of pre-tax charges to impair goodwill and certain waste-to-energy facilities in 2013 as discussed above in Goodwill Impairments and (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Energy and Environmental Services and Renewable Energy organizations, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage services and (iii) the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage, long distance moving services, and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste. Significant items affecting the comparability for the periods presented include: • Net charges of $66 million, $339 million, and $59 million primarily related to impairments of oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively; • Higher costs related to remediation services in 2015; • The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment in 2014; and • Improved results in our Strategic Business Solutions in 2014 and 2015. Corporate and Other — Significant items affecting the comparability for the periods presented include: • Restructuring costs related to our August 2014 reorganization and subsequent benefits resulting from our restructuring efforts; • Lower medical costs in 2015 driven by lower claims and reduced headcount and higher year-over-year costs in 2014; • The transfer of certain sales employees to our Solid Waste and Other segments that were included in this segment in 2014 as described above; • Continued focus on controlling costs resulting in lower professional fees, telecommunications, contract labor, and travel and entertainment in 2015; 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Charges for the settlement of a legal dispute and related fees in 2014; • Unfavorable adjustments in 2014 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets; and • Increased risk management costs in 2015 primarily related to certain higher than anticipated auto and general liability claim settlements and favorable risk management allocation in 2014. Interest Expense, net Our interest expense, net was $385 million in 2015, $466 million in 2014 and $477 million in 2013. During 2015, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of a make-whole redemption of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1%. During 2014, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to (i) the impacts that lower market interest rates had on certain of our tax-exempt debt; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and (iii) reduced costs associated with our letter of credit facilities due to improvements in the Company’s overall credit rating. These decreases were partially offset by increases in expense associated with our terminated interest rate swaps due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt During 2015, we refinanced a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of a make-whole redemption of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1% and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations by three years. Additional details related to each component of the refinancing follow: Make-Whole Redemption — In January 2015, we repaid $947 million of WM senior notes, which comprised all of the outstanding senior notes maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The repayment of these debt balances was achieved by exercising the optional redemption provisions of the notes, which required that we pay the outstanding principal plus a make-whole premium. The “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the $122 million of charges related to these redemptions. Tender Offers — During 2015, WM and WM Holdings made cash tender offers to purchase any and all of certain outstanding senior notes. The series of notes targeted in the tenders and the amounts tendered of each series are summarized below: • $449 million of WM Holdings 7.10% senior notes due 2026, of which $145 million were tendered; • $577 million of WM 7.00% senior notes due 2028, of which $182 million were tendered; • $223 million of WM 7.375% senior notes due 2029, of which $84 million were tendered; • $496 million of WM 7.75% senior notes due 2032, of which $286 million were tendered; and • $600 million of WM 6.125% senior notes due 2039, of which $326 million were tendered. The “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $430 million of charges related to these tender offers. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of $38 million, $53 million and $34 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility, as well as (i) noncontrolling investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. In 2014, we recognized an additional $11 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value. Other, net We recognized other, net expense of $7 million, $29 million and $74 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were impacted by impairment charges of $5 million, $22 million and $71 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities. Partially offsetting the 2013 charges was a $4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment. The remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $308 million in 2015, $413 million in 2014 and $364 million in 2013. These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately 29.1%, 23.6% and 73.8% for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) federal tax credits; (iii) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes; (iv) the realization of state net operating losses and credits; (v) tax audit settlements and (vi) the tax implications of divestitures and impairments. The impacts of these items are summarized below: • Investment in Refined Coal Facility — Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $23 million, $21 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal facility investment. • Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties — Our low-income housing properties investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $34 million, $37 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our low-income housing properties investment. • Other Federal Tax Credits — During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in the refined coal facility and low-income housing properties resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $15 million, $13 million and $13 million, respectively. • Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes — Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state law resulted in a reduction of $18 million, a reduction of $24 million and an increase of $4 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • State Net Operating Losses and Credits — During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $17 million, $16 million and $16 million, respectively. • Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions to our provision for income taxes of $10 million, $12 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. • Tax Implications of Divestitures — During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. During 2015, the Company recorded an additional $10 million net gain primarily related to post-closing adjustments on the Wheelabrator divestiture. Had this gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $4 million. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to divestitures. • Tax Implications of Impairments — A portion of the impairment charges recognized are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have been reduced by $2 million, $8 million and $235 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to asset impairments and unusual items. We expect our 2016 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 35.0% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items, which is similar to prior year expectations. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was signed into law on December 18, 2015 and included an extension for five years of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2016 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2015 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2015 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately $65 million. This reduction will be offset by increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Noncontrolling Interests Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014 and $32 million in 2013. The income for 2014 and 2013 was principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that owned three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from the third parties in anticipation of our sale of the Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities, respectively. The income for 2013 includes a net loss of $10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the $20 million impairment charge related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company discussed above in (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2015 and 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions): December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Remaining cubic yards 4,740 298 5,038 4,708 275 4,983 Remaining tonnage 4,728 304 5,032 4,660 275 4,935 Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2015 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 21 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2015, segregated by their estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: 0 to 5 6 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 40 41+ Total Owned 9 16 25 60 91 201 Operated through lease(a) 6 — 1 3 5 15 Operating contracts(b) 10 5 3 7 8 33 Total landfills 25 21 29 70 104 249 (a) Landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease. (b) For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the operating contracts. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions): December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance, beginning of year 4,660 275 4,935 4,769 282 5,051 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 32 4 36 (90 ) (5 ) (95 ) Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 105 105 — 90 90 Expansion permits granted(b) 82 (82 ) — 94 (94 ) — Airspace consumed (97 ) — (97 ) (96 ) — (96 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) 51 2 53 (17 ) 2 (15 ) Balance, end of year 4,728 304 5,032 4,660 275 4,935 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits. (b) We received expansion permits at six of our landfills during 2015 and eight of our landfills during 2014, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2015 and 2014 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2015 2014 # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay Solid waste landfills 244 (a) 96,777 355 247 92,847 341 Hazardous waste landfills. 5 567 2 5 505 2 249 97,344 357 252 93,352 343 Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 5 960 15 3,768 98,304 (b) 97,120 (b) (a) In 2015, we acquired two landfills, our contract expired at two landfills and we closed three landfills. (b) These amounts include 1.2 million tons at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2015, our closed sites management group managed 210 closed landfills. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The following table reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2015 (in millions): Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2014 $ 13,463 $ (7,690 ) $ 5,773 Capital additions 437 — 437 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 61 — 61 Acquisitions 126 — 126 Amortization of landfill airspace — (409 ) (409 ) Foreign currency translation (184 ) 61 (123 ) Asset retirements and other adjustments (131 ) 113 (18 ) December 31, 2015 $ 13,772 $ (7,925 ) $ 5,847 As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2016, and approximately $900 million in 2017 and 2018 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2015 (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2014 $ 1,443 $ 235 Obligations incurred and capitalized 61 — Obligations settled (71 ) (30 ) Interest accretion 89 3 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (11 ) 5 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 7 (4 ) December 31, 2015 $ 1,518 $ 209 Landfill Costs and Expenses — As disclosed in the Operating Expenses section above, our landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 89 $ 88 $ 87 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 1 14 (10 ) Leachate and methane collection and treatment 96 84 77 Landfill remediation costs 5 9 10 Other landfill site costs 64 71 68 Total landfill operating costs $ 255 $ 266 $ 232 The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average period until settlement of the underlying obligations. Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 409 $ 380 $ 400 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 97 96 93 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.21 $ 3.96 $ 4.29 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments, and we have also returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions): 2015 2014 Cash and cash equivalents $ 39 $ 1,307 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 94 $ 129 Other 11 42 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 105 $ 171 Debt: Current portion $ 253 $ 1,090 Long-term portion 8,728 8,345 Total debt $ 8,981 $ 9,435 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 23 $ 45 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, included a portion of the $1.95 billion of proceeds from the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. In 2015, we have primarily allocated available cash to the acquisition of Deffenbaugh, repurchasing shares and paying premiums on the early extinguishment of debt. Discussion of these activities is included in Notes 19, 15 and 7, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restricted trust and escrow accounts — The decrease in final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the closure of certain trust and escrow accounts which were converted to other forms of financial assurance. Other restricted trust and escrow accounts at December 31, 2014 included the funding of a legal settlement which was paid in full in the second quarter of 2015. Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2015 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt repayments of $427 million and (ii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, and discounts. As of December 31, 2015, we had $732 million of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $500 million of 2.6% senior notes that mature in September 2016; (ii) $146 million of tax-exempt bonds and (iii) $20 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, $316 million of tax-exempt bonds have term interest rate periods subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. We have classified the $20 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility as long-term because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a long-term basis. Based on our intent and ability to refinance other portions of our current obligations on a long-term basis as of December 31, 2015, including through use of forecasted available capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, we have classified an additional $775 million of debt as long-term. The remaining $253 million is classified as current obligations. During 2015, we refinanced a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes in order to reduce the weighted average interest rate and extend the weighted average duration of our debt balances. We achieved this through a combination of a make-whole redemption of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes consisting of: • $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due March 1, 2025; • $450 million of 3.90% senior notes due March 1, 2035; and • $750 million of 4.10% senior notes due March 1, 2045. The net proceeds from these debt issuances were $1.78 billion. The Company used the proceeds from the 2025 notes for general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the 2035 notes and the 2045 notes were used to pay the purchase price and accrued interest for the notes redeemed through the tender offers discussed above and for general corporate purposes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the debt transactions. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility: 2015 2014 Revolving credit facility(a) $ 831 $ 785 Letter of credit facilities(b) 150 400 Other(c) 316 257 $ 1,297 $ 1,442 (a) In July 2015, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility extending the term through July 2020. At December 31, 2015, we had $20 million of outstanding borrowings and $831 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,399 million. (b) As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $150 million under letter of credit facilities with terms extending through December 2018. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of December 31, 2015. (c) These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,498 $ 2,331 $ 2,455 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,608 ) $ 995 $ (1,900 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,155 ) $ (2,072 ) $ (687 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2015 to 2014 are summarized below: • Increased earnings from our traditional Solid Waste business — In 2015, we saw an increase in cash earnings from our traditional Solid Waste business which was enhanced by acquisitions and corporate overhead cost reductions. These cash flow improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in earnings of our recycling operations. • Cash flow of divested businesses — The divestiture of Wheelabrator in December 2014 coupled with the sale of other Solid Waste businesses throughout 2014 affected the year-over-year comparison by approximately $140 million. • Decrease in tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was $329 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by (i) lower year-over-year pre-tax earnings primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2015 and (ii) the tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairments. • Decrease in interest payments — Cash paid for interest decreased $77 million, primarily due to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes during the first quarter of 2015, which is discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. • Multiemployer pension plan settlements — In 2015, we paid approximately $60 million for multiemployer pension plan settlements primarily associated with the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan and the Teamsters Employers Local 945 Pension Fund. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Increase in bonus payments — Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted by approximately $65 million on a year-over-year basis, as the annual incentive plan payments made in the first quarter of 2015 were significantly higher than payments made in the first quarter of 2014. • Forward-starting swaps — During the first quarter of 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured, and we paid cash of $36 million to settle the liabilities related to the swaps, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This cash payment was classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by changes in our assets and liabilities accounts, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. However, we did experience continued improvement in both trade accounts receivable and accounts payable. Although our working capital changes may vary from year-to-year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. The most significant items affecting the comparisons of our operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 are summarized below: • Increase in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $1.2 billion, on a year-over-year basis. Certain of the more significant drivers of our earnings improvement include: • Lower non-cash impairment charges of $652 million in 2014 as compared to 2013; and • The net gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business of $519 million in 2014. After considering these items, and certain other non-cash items included in our comparative results, our earnings drove an improvement in our cash flows from operating activities of approximately $100 million. • Increase in tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $242 million higher on a year-over-year basis due to (i) higher pre-tax earnings; (ii) approximately $210 million anticipated overpayment during 2014, when comparing our year-end tax provisions to payments made throughout the year and (iii) taxes associated with the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations. • Forward-starting swaps — During 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured, and we paid cash of $36 million to settle the liabilities related to the swaps. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. • Changes in other operating assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by changes in our working capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Capital expenditures — We used $1,233 million during 2015 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,151 million in 2014 and $1,271 million in 2013. The increase in capital expenditures in 2015 is primarily attributable to new business opportunities, growth in our existing business and the timing of replacement of aging assets. • Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures and other assets (net of cash divested) were $145 million in 2015, $2,253 million in 2014 and $138 million in 2013. In 2015, $79 million of these divestitures were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets. In 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. In 2013, our proceeds from divestitures included approximately $41 million related to oil and gas producing properties and $14 million related to certain of our medical waste service operations and a transfer station in our Greater Mid-Atlantic Area. The remaining amount reported for 2013, generally relates to the sale of fixed assets. • Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $554 million in 2015 compared to $35 million in 2014 and $724 million in 2013. In 2015, $415 million of our spending on acquisitions was for the collection and disposal operations of Deffenbaugh. The remainder of our 2015 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. All of our 2014 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. In 2013, our acquisitions consisted primarily of the recycling operations of Greenstar, for which we paid $170 million, and substantially all of the assets of RCI, for which we paid $481 million. The remainder of our 2013 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business and energy services operations. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. • Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $20 million, $33 million and $33 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, our investments primarily consisted of additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility, which generates federal tax credits. In 2014 and 2013, our investments primarily related to additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility and waste diversion technology companies. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts contributed $51 million to our investing activities in 2015 compared with $19 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013. In 2015, these activities were largely related to our replacement of funded trust and escrow accounts with alternative forms of financial assurance. • Other — Net cash provided by our other investing activities was $3 million during 2015. Net cash used by our other investing activities of $58 million and $81 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in the U.K., prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Share repurchases — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $600 million for share repurchases during both 2015 and 2014 and $239 million for share repurchases during 2013. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We announced in December 2015 that the Board of Directors refreshed its prior authorization of up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. • Dividend payments — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared and paid in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We paid an aggregate of $695 million in cash dividends during 2015, compared with $693 million in 2014, and $683 million in 2013. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.365 in 2013, to $0.375 in 2014, and to $0.385 in 2015 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. In December 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.385 to $0.41 per share for dividends declared in 2016. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant. • Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options generated $77 million of financing cash inflows during 2015 compared with $93 million during 2014 and $132 million during 2013. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the level of stock options exercised throughout the year, which is primarily driven by changes in the Company’s stock price and the number of exercisable options. • Debt borrowings (repayments) — Net debt repayments were $427 million in 2015 and $751 million in 2014 compared to net debt borrowings of $155 million in 2013. The following summarizes our cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Borrowings: U.S. revolving credit facility $ 100 $ 2,225 $ 1,140 Canadian credit facility and term loan 11 88 1,007 Senior notes 1,781 347 — Tax-exempt bonds 262 — — Other debt 183 157 85 $ 2,337 $ 2,817 $ 2,232 Repayments: U.S. revolving credit facility $ (80 ) $ (2,645 ) $ (1,120 ) Canadian credit facility and term loan (130 ) (243 ) (666 ) Senior notes (1,970 ) (350 ) — Tax-exempt bonds (341 ) (123 ) (162 ) Capital leases and other debt (243 ) (207 ) (129 ) $ (2,764 ) $ (3,568 ) $ (2,077 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ (427 ) $ (751 ) $ 155 For the year ended December 31, 2015, non-cash financing activities included $262 million of tax-exempt bond refundings and reissuances. For the year ended December 31, 2013, non-cash financing activities included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds, of $99 million. During 2014, we did not have any significant non-cash financing activities. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt — Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt of $555 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 are primarily related to (i) make-whole premiums paid on certain senior notes that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturities and (ii) premiums paid to tender certain high-coupon senior notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. • Acquisitions of and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests — The purchases of and distributions paid to our noncontrolling interests were $1 million, $125 million and $59 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase during 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs related to our waste-to-energy facilities in December 2014 for $91 million, in anticipation of our sale of our Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these LLCs. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities:(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 112 $ 139 $ 132 $ 106 $ 140 $ 2,105 $ 2,734 Environmental remediation 32 26 30 19 11 89 207 144 165 162 125 151 2,194 2,941 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 730 221 792 175 740 6,379 9,037 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 89 77 61 51 42 281 601 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(f) 184 164 126 100 86 424 1,084 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2015 $ 1,147 $ 627 $ 1,141 $ 451 $ 1,019 $ 9,278 $ 13,663 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest rates. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 include $316 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items Cash Taxes — Our tax payments in 2015, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, were $329 million lower than 2014, primarily due to (i) lower pre-tax earnings due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt and (ii) the tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairments. Bonus Depreciation — The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was signed into law on December 18, 2015 and included an extension for five years of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2016 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2015 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2015 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately $65 million. This reduction will be offset by increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken. Overall, the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs resulted in increased cash taxes of approximately $25 million in 2015. Uncertain Tax Positions — We have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we might make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2015, we anticipate that approximately $36 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and $5 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals primarily relate to the deductibility and exclusion from gross income of certain federal tax items and other miscellaneous state tax items, each of which is individually insignificant. The recognition of the unrecognized tax benefits is expected to result from the filing of our tax returns, audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2015, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standard Pending Adoption In May 2014, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our income from operations margins in recent years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2015, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities, although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our ongoing financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations section of Item 1. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.0 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. Approximately, $911 million of our debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months. Our variable-rate debt obligations are (i) $491 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $316 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities; (iii) $84 million of outstanding borrowings under our Canadian term loan and (iv) $20 million of borrowings outstanding under $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2016 interest expense by approximately $8 million. As of December 31, 2014, the effective interest rates of approximately $1.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments, if any, can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $600 million at December 31, 2015. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. During the three years ended December 31, 2015, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities, with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives divested in conjunction with the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as a cost center in India and investments in Hong Kong. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating costs. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. During 2015, we did see a reduction in stockholders’ equity of $159 million due to the fluctuations in the Canadian dollar within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk using currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not have a material impact to the Company. The foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and translation. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 20:44:47.615329
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview for more information on our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following: • Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. • We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively. • A key element of our strategy is yield management through focus on price leadership, which has presented challenges to keep existing business and win new business at reasonable returns. We have also continued our environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee to offset costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases and our unwillingness to pursue lower margin volumes may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. Additionally, we have in the past and continue to face purported class action lawsuits related to our customer service agreements, prices and fees. • We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result. • We may not be able to maintain cost savings achieved through restructuring efforts. • Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. • Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions. • Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others. • Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. • Liabilities associated with acquisitions, including ones that may exist only because of past operations of an acquired business, may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than anticipated. • Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Compliance with existing or increased future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures, and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors. Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as: • limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities; • limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; • limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; • mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or • limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations. We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of, including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or third-party landfill operators, among other reasons. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in the United States and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the United States or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. However, the new United States presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. We cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the United States, the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business. While reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our Company. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. A significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe, particularly China. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. Additionally, the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade. If Operation Green Fence or other similar initiatives, such as increased container weight tracking and port fees, new regulations, or restrictions and tariffs on exporting increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such initiatives regulations, restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices. Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and plastics, which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, and the price fluctuations for these commodities could be impacted by significant changes in United States foreign trade policy and increased tariffs on international trade, as Chinese paper mills are the primary consumer of the fiber we market. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements flows positively, as we experienced in 2016, or negatively, as we experienced in 2015 and 2014. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The increase in market prices in 2016 for commodities resulted in a year-over-year increase in revenue of $51 million. The decline in market prices in 2015 and 2014 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $138 million and $53 million, respectively. Additionally, under some agreements, our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers. In some cases, if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. As we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall. Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our Energy Services business. Demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices, such as the pronounced price decreases beginning in late 2014 and continuing low prices throughout 2015 and 2016. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future. Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our Energy Services business. Energy Services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste, and electronics at landfills. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested waste-to-energy facilities, have historically provided our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives. If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer. Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies. Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which: • agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and • local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments. Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in China could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations. Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results. We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses. The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we have recently settled cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we continue to face similar claims. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins. We have an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices. We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. However, natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. It will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program. We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage. Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions. Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans. We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the event of our withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, and we recognized related expenses of $51 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2014. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters. There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. We also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense. We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities. The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results. In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile. If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third-party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have $1.6 billion of debt as of December 31, 2016 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow. We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$50 million Canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2020 and March 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate. Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern United States, can increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins. For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations. Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. From time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. We are also party to civil litigation. As a large company with operations across the United States and Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and employment-related claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to: • alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous materials and odors; • sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements, prices and fees; and • federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity. We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations. Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we occupy approximately 366,000 square feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and throughout Canada. Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our operating properties, vehicles and equipment are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional property and equipment for expansion, for replacement of assets and in connection with our strategic growth plans.

Cash dividends declared and paid were $726 million in 2016, or $1.64 per common share, $695 million in 2015, or $1.54 per common share, and $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share. In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.425 per share for dividends declared in 2017. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our share repurchases have also been made in accordance with plans approved by our Board of Directors. We announced in December 2015 that the Board of Directors authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. During 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of $725 million of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements, of which $150 million was repurchased pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization granted in February 2015. We received a total of 11.2 million shares pursuant to these ASR agreements with a weighted average per share purchase price of $60.49. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes common stock repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2016 (shares in millions): Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period TotalNumber ofSharesPurchased AveragePrice Paidper Share Total Number ofShares Purchased asPart of PubliclyAnnounced Plans orPrograms Approximate MaximumDollar Value of Sharesthat May Yet bePurchased Under thePlans or Programs October 1 — 31 — $ — — $ 650 million November 1 — 30 2.8 (a) $ 63.41 (a) 2.8 (a) $ 425 million (a) December 1 — 31 — $ — — $ 750 million (b) Total 2.8 $ 63.41 2.8 (a) In November 2016, the Company entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $225 million of our common stock.

The ASR agreement completed in February 2017, at which time we received 0.4 million additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of $69.43. (b) We announced in December 2016 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $750 million in future share repurchases, which supersedes and replaces remaining authority under any prior Board of Directors authorization for share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Overview Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address the current needs, while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs, of our customers. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Our fundamental strategy has not changed; we remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement, with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions, the regulatory environment, asset and resource availability and current technology. We believe that focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets, will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages. Simultaneously, we believe the combination of cost control, process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the Company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations. We believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry. Notable items of our 2016 financial results include: • Revenues of $13,609 million in 2016 compared with $12,961 million in 2015, an increase of $648 million. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) the combined impact of yield and volume growth, which contributed $437 million of additional revenues, primarily in our collection and disposal and recycling operations and (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures, which contributed $238 million of revenue growth, primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations and business assets of SWS in January 2016. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation related to our Canadian operations; • Operating expenses of $8,486 million in 2016, or 62.4% of revenues, compared with $8,231 million, or 63.5% of revenues, in 2015. This increase of $255 million is primarily attributable to (i) incremental costs attributable to acquired businesses, net of divestitures, of approximately $143 million; (ii) increased landfill operating costs of $97 million, primarily landfill leachate management costs; (iii) increased cost of goods sold of $60 million, primarily related to higher recycling commodity prices and (iv) costs associated with higher volumes, estimated at $60 million. These increases were partially offset by lower fuel costs of $66 million, primarily due to lower year-over-year average fuel prices; • Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,410 million in 2016, compared with $1,343 million in 2015, or 10.4% of revenues for both periods. This increase of $67 million is primarily attributable to higher labor and related benefits of $94 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements costs, merit increases and higher severance costs. These increases were partially offset by reduced legal fees, lower bank charges and favorable litigation settlements; • Income from operations of $2,296 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2016 compared with $2,045 million, or 15.8% of revenues, in 2015, an increase of $251 million. In addition to the items discussed above, the comparability was also affected by asset impairments and unusual items in both periods, as discussed below; • Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,182 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for 2016, as compared with $753 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the earnings growth of our core operations discussed above as well as the 2015 loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed below; and • In 2016, we returned $1,451 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $1,295 million in 2015. The Company had a very successful 2016, exceeding expectations and carrying forward our momentum from 2015 by generating strong earnings and cash flow. Our commitment to executing on our strategies of disciplined profitable volume growth and controlling costs, through focused differentiation and continuous improvement, drove these impressive results in 2016 and have built a strong foundation to produce solid earnings and generate further growth in 2017. This growth, combined with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet, supports the Company’s continued focus on investing in our business, paying dividends, pursuing attractive opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions and considering the market for share repurchases. The following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2016 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating to $151 million, primarily related to (i) a $43 million impairment charge due to a loss of expected volumes for a landfill; (ii) a $42 million charge to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas; (iii) $41 million of impairment charges related to minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies; (iv) a $10 million goodwill impairment charge related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (v) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. These charges had a negative impact of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2015 results were affected by the following: • The recognition of a pre-tax loss of $555 million, primarily related to the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. These charges had a negative impact of $0.75 on our diluted earnings per share; • Pre-tax charges of $51 million associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; and • Net pre-tax charges of $102 million resulting from impairments, restructuring and divestitures, of which $66 million related to the impairment of our oil and gas producing properties. These items had a negative impact of $0.14 on our diluted earnings per share. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,960 $ 2,498 $ 2,331 Capital expenditures (1,339 ) (1,233 ) (1,151 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) 43 145 2,253 Free cash flow $ 1,664 $ 1,410 $ 3,433 When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the comparable period in 2015, the increase of $462 million is primarily related to (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business; (ii) cash proceeds of $67 million from the termination of our cross-currency swaps in the first quarter of 2016; (iii) trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plan (“Multiemployer Pension Plan”) settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iv) lower annual incentive plan cash payments of $46 million in the current year; partially offset, by higher income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $36 million in the current year. Additionally, we experienced net favorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2014, the increase of $167 million is primarily related to (i) lower income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $329 million in 2015; (ii) lower interest paid of $77 million in 2015 and (iii) the settlement of forward-starting swap liabilities of $36 million in 2014. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in 2014; (ii) Multiemployer Pension Plan settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iii) higher year-over-year annual incentive plan payments of approximately $65 million in 2015. Finally, we experienced net unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. Capital expenditures increased by $106 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and by $82 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. In addition, the construction of a waste-water treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. Although we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management. The significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of (i) our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion; (ii) our investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which was part of our Wheelabrator business, for $155 million and (iii) our Puerto Rico operations for consideration of $80 million, including $65 million in cash. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Acquisitions Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling (“SWS”) — On January 8, 2016, Waste Management Inc. of Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of SWS in Southern Florida for total consideration of $525 million. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”) — On March 26, 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest, for total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $400 million. Deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills. Divestitures Wheelabrator Business — On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale, which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pre-tax basis. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these agreements. Other — In addition to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, we also divested our Puerto Rico operations, as well as certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014. In total, these divested businesses and assets provided $0.18 of diluted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adoption of New Accounting Standards Debt Issuance Costs — In April 2015, and as subsequently amended, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended authoritative guidance associated with debt issuance costs which were previously presented as assets related to recognized debt liabilities. The amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs, other than those costs related to line of credit arrangements, be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of $52 million of such costs in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. Consolidation — In February 2015, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with consolidation. The amended guidance makes changes to existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities, including limited partnerships and variable interest entities. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: • Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; • We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; • There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and • Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 16 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2016, three landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: • Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; • Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; • The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and • The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. Long-Lived Asset Impairments We assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. If necessary, impairments are recorded in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Property and Equipment, including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Expansion Airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs. We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment. When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of these assets is reasonable. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) and Energy and Environmental Services organizations, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and expanded service offerings and solutions. We also offer portable self-storage and long distance moving services; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let®; and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below. Our Wheelabrator business, divested in December 2014, provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. The following table summarizes revenues during the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Solid Waste $ 13,968 $ 13,285 $ 13,449 Other 2,278 2,065 2,191 Wheelabrator — — 817 Intercompany (2,637 ) (2,389 ) (2,461 ) Total $ 13,609 $ 12,961 $ 13,996 The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Commercial $ 3,480 $ 3,332 $ 3,393 Residential 2,487 2,499 2,543 Industrial 2,412 2,252 2,231 Other 423 356 340 Total collection 8,802 8,439 8,507 Landfill 3,110 2,919 2,849 Transfer 1,512 1,377 1,353 Recycling 1,221 1,163 1,370 Other 1,601 1,452 1,561 Wheelabrator — — 817 Intercompany (2,637 ) (2,389 ) (2,461 ) Total $ 13,609 $ 12,961 $ 13,996 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions): Period-to-Period Change2016 vs. 2015 Period-to-Period Change2015 vs. 2014 Amount As a % ofTotalCompany(a) Amount As a % ofTotalCompany(a) Average yield(b) $ 251 1.9 % $ (106 ) (0.8 )% Volume 186 1.4 (215 ) (1.6 ) Internal revenue growth 437 3.3 (321 ) (2.4 ) Acquisitions 268 2.1 174 1.3 Foreign currency translation (27 ) (0.2 ) (126 ) (1.0 ) Subtotal (before Divestitures) 678 5.2 % (273 ) (2.1 )% Divestitures (30 ) (762 ) Total $ 648 $ (1,035 ) (a) Calculated by dividing the amount of the current year increase or decrease by the prior year’s total Company revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year ($12,931 million and $13,234 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively). (b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related business basis (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2016 vs. 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange2015 vs. 2014 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness(i) Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness(i) Average yield: Collection and disposal $ 267 2.4 % $ 203 1.8 % Recycling commodities 51 4.6 (138 ) (10.4 ) Fuel surcharges and mandated fees (67 ) (13.1 ) (171 ) (24.8 ) Total $ 251 1.9 % $ (106 ) (0.8 )% (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year. Our revenues increased $648 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, driven by (i) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (ii) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (iii) higher volumes and (iv) higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were (i) lower revenues from our fuel surcharges program due to lower year-over-year diesel fuel prices; (ii) divestitures and (iii) foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our Canadian operations. Our revenues decreased $1,035 million, or 7.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year, driven by (i) divestitures in 2014, principally our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area; (ii) lower volumes; (iii) lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining diesel fuel prices; (iv) lower market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and (v) foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these revenue declines were 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations and (ii) revenue from acquired operations, primarily the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in March 2015. The following provides further details about our period-to-period change in revenues: Average yield Collection and disposal average yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $267 million, or 2.4%, and $203 million, or 1.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2016 and 2015. The details are as follows (dollars in millions): Period-to-PeriodChange2016 vs. 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange2015 vs. 2014 Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Amount As a % ofRelatedBusiness Commercial $ 130 4.2 % $ 92 3.0 % Industrial 59 2.8 55 2.7 Residential 46 1.9 39 1.6 Total collection 235 3.0 186 2.4 Landfill 15 0.8 9 0.6 Transfer 17 2.5 8 1.2 Total collection and disposal $ 267 2.4 % $ 203 1.8 % Revenues from our environmental fee contributed $72 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to our collection and disposal average yield. Recycling commodities — Our revenues increased $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year period due to a 7% year-over-year increase in the market prices for the recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage services. During 2015, revenues declined by $138 million as compared with the prior year due to a 12% year-over-year decline in recycling commodities prices. Fuel surcharges and mandated fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $67 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. Market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 14% in 2016 and 30% in 2015, which caused the decline in fuel surcharge revenues in 2016 and 2015. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These fees did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the periods presented. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Volume Our revenues increased $186 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year due to higher volumes. The year-over-year comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions, as discussed below. We experienced higher volumes in all of our collection and disposal lines of business, with the exception of our residential line of business, as a result of (i) improving market conditions; (ii) reduced customer churn and improved sales performance supported by our focus on disciplined growth and (iii) an additional workday in 2016. Additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows: • Due to our focus on renegotiating existing contracts and winning new contracts with reasonable returns, we continue to see revenue declines in our residential line of business; and • In our ancillary service businesses, we experienced higher volumes in 2016 as compared with the prior year resulting from our Energy and Environmental Services organization, particularly our remediation and construction services, WM Renewable Energy and our portable self-storage businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by lower volumes resulting from lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business. Declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease $215 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with the prior year. We experienced lower volumes in (i) our collection line of business, primarily due to competition and our pricing strategies; (ii) our MRFs, primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets and our strategy to not renew municipal contracts that did not reflect current market conditions and (iii) our ancillary services businesses, primarily due to the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization and lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business. These decreases in volumes were partially offset by increases in the municipal solid waste business driven by new business and improving market conditions that favorably affected our landfill and transfer lines of business. Acquisitions and divestitures Revenues increased $268 million and $174 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, due to acquisitions. The increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. The revenue increase in 2015 was principally due to the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in March 2015. These revenues were offset by revenue decreases of $30 million and $762 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, due to divestitures. The decrease in revenues in 2015 was primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014 of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business, including rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Our operating expenses increased $255 million, or 3.1%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased $771 million, or 8.6%, when comparing 2015 with 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.4% in 2016, 63.5% in 2015, and 64.3% in 2014. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2016 Period-to-PeriodChange 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Labor and related benefits $ 2,410 $ 29 1.2 % $ 2,381 $ (71 ) (2.9 )% $ 2,452 Transfer and disposal costs 974 35 3.7 939 4 0.4 935 Maintenance and repairs 1,076 54 5.3 1,022 (159 ) (13.5 ) 1,181 Subcontractor costs 1,193 56 4.9 1,137 (86 ) (7.0 ) 1,223 Cost of goods sold 858 67 8.5 791 (183 ) (18.8 ) 974 Fuel 300 (61 ) (16.9 ) 361 (192 ) (34.7 ) 553 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 702 40 6.0 662 (7 ) (1.0 ) 669 Landfill operating costs 352 97 38.0 255 (11 ) (4.1 ) 266 Risk management 192 (29 ) (13.1 ) 221 2 0.9 219 Other 429 (33 ) (7.1 ) 462 (68 ) (12.8 ) 530 $ 8,486 $ 255 3.1 % $ 8,231 $ (771 ) (8.6 )% $ 9,002 Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between periods reported include: Labor and related benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to (i) higher wages due to merit increases; (ii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (iii) health and welfare cost increases; (iv) an additional workday in 2016 and (v) higher incentive compensation costs. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans and (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business. The decrease in labor and related benefits in 2015 as compared with 2014 was due to (i) reduced costs of $88 million due to the divestitures in 2014 of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area; (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business and lower volumes in our collection line of business and (iii) lower health and welfare costs. These cost decreases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans; (ii) higher wages due to merit increases and (iii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in March 2015. Transfer and disposal costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by acquisitions, primarily SWS, and our overall increase in volumes. The increase in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to incurring third-party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. These cost increases were partially offset by $53 million in reduced costs due to the divestitures in 2014. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Maintenance and repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by (i) higher labor and parts and supplies costs and (ii) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was largely driven by a $177 million decrease due to the divestitures in 2014, which was partially offset by increased costs related to the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh. Subcontractor costs — The increase in subcontractor cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by (i) acquisitions and (ii) higher volumes in our WMSBS organization. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by (i) volume decreases in our WMSBS organization and (ii) lower landfill and recycling costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. Cost of goods sold — The increase in cost of goods sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to (i) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) increased costs in our remediation services business, partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) lower costs of $81 million due to the 2014 divestitures; (iii) increased efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and (iv) ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control. Fuel — The decrease in fuel costs in 2016 and 2015 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by (i) lower fuel prices; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles; (iii) year-over-year increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and (iv) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. The increase in collection volumes in 2016 partially offset these decreases. Disposal and franchise fees and taxes — The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to (i) higher landfill volumes and (ii) increased municipal franchise fees and subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. The decrease when comparing 2015 to 2014 is primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014. Landfill operating costs — The increase in landfill operating costs when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily due to higher leachate management costs. Leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased. Higher leachate transportation and disposal costs also affected the comparison of our landfill operating costs for 2015 and 2014, though the increased costs were more than offset by the impact of 2014 divestitures and discount rate adjustments. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record adjustments to our landfill operating costs for changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets. Risk management — The decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain uninsured losses and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation claims. Other — The decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to lower rental costs and favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was principally driven by a decrease of $63 million due to the divestitures in 2014. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67 million, or 5.0%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased $138 million, or 9.3%, when comparing 2015 with 2014. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.4% in 2016, 10.4% in 2015 and 10.6% in 2014. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2016 Period-to-PeriodChange 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Labor and related benefits $ 968 $ 94 10.8 % $ 874 $ (59 ) (6.3 )% $ 933 Professional fees 97 (15 ) (13.4 ) 112 (14 ) (11.1 ) 126 Provision for bad debts 40 4 11.1 36 (5 ) (12.2 ) 41 Other 305 (16 ) (5.0 ) 321 (60 ) (15.7 ) 381 $ 1,410 $ 67 5.0 % $ 1,343 $ (138 ) (9.3 )% $ 1,481 Significant factors affecting our expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 include: Labor and related benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits was primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) merit increases; (iii) higher severance costs and (iv) acquisitions. Professional fees — The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower legal fees. Other — The decrease in other expenses was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges. The divestitures in 2014, primarily the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014, favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014. In addition to the impact of divestitures, other significant factors affecting our expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 include: Labor and related benefits — The decrease in labor and related benefits was due to (i) cost savings from our August 2014 reorganization and (ii) lower incentive compensation costs, which were partially offset by merit increases. Other — The decrease in other expenses was principally driven by lower litigation settlement costs and our continued focus on controlling costs. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses include (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 40 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2016 Period-to-PeriodChange 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 773 $ 13 1.7 % $ 760 $ (74 ) (8.9 )% $ 834 Amortization of landfill airspace 428 19 4.6 409 29 7.6 380 Amortization of intangible assets 100 24 31.6 76 (2 ) (2.6 ) 78 $ 1,301 $ 56 4.5 % $ 1,245 $ (47 ) (3.6 )% $ 1,292 The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets during 2016 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2016 as compared to the prior year is due to increased volumes at our landfills, partially offset by changes in our landfill estimates. The decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business as discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased volumes, a portion of which relates to the acquisition of Deffenbaugh in March 2015. This increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates. Restructuring Costs During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $2 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $15 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $10 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our Eastern Canada Area and our acquisition of Deffenbaugh. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items The following table summarizes the major components of (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 (Income) expense from divestitures $ 9 $ (7 ) $ (515 ) Asset impairments 59 89 355 Other 44 — — $ 112 $ 82 $ (160 ) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized net charges of $112 million, primarily related to (i) $44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as further discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (ii) a $43 million charge to impair a landfill in Western Pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes; (iii) $12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (iv) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net charges of $82 million, primarily related to (i) $66 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices; (ii) $18 million of charges to write down or divest certain assets in our recycling operations and (iii) a $5 million impairment of a landfill in our Western Canada Area due to revised post-closure cost estimates. Partially offsetting these charges was $7 million in net gains from divestitures, including a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net gains of $160 million, primarily related to the following: • Divestitures — We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our divestitures. • Oil and gas producing properties impairments — We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil and gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. • Goodwill impairments — We recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our recycling reporting unit. • Other impairments — We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): 2016 Period-to-PeriodChange 2015 Period-to-PeriodChange 2014 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 1,430 $ 140 10.9 % $ 1,290 $ (11 ) (0.8 )% $ 1,301 Tier 2 604 (25 ) (4.0 ) 629 (82 ) (11.5 ) 711 Tier 3 912 104 12.9 808 21 2.7 787 Solid Waste 2,946 219 8.0 2,727 (72 ) (2.6 ) 2,799 Other (100 ) 60 (37.5 ) (160 ) 240 (60.0 ) (400 ) Corporate and other (550 ) (28 ) 5.4 (522 ) 247 (32.1 ) (769 ) Wheelabrator — — — — (669 ) * 669 Total $ 2,296 $ 251 12.3 % $ 2,045 $ (254 ) (11.0 )% $ 2,299 * Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison. Our segments are discussed further in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below: • Our Traditional Solid Waste business benefited from internal revenue growth; and • We recognized $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans in 2015 impacting all three tiers. In addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2016 to 2015: • Our recycling business was favorable in 2016 compared to 2015 principally due to (i) continued cost reductions; (ii) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (iii) the impairment of various recycling assets in 2015; • Increased leachate management costs in Tier 2 in 2016; • Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to merit increases, higher incentive compensation costs and increases in health and welfare costs; and • The impairment of a landfill in Tier 2 in 2016 due to a loss of expected volumes. In addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2015 to 2014: • The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on the results of our Canadian operations in Tiers 1 and 2 in 2015; • The unfavorable impact on our oilfield services business, primarily in Tier 2, of reduced drilling and auxiliary activities as a result of declining oil and gas prices in 2015; • The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2015; and • Our recycling business was unfavorable in 2015 compared to 2014 principally due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) the impairment of various recycling assets in 2015. These unfavorable amounts were partially offset by continued cost reductions. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Energy and Environmental Services and WM Renewable Energy organizations that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) our recycling brokerage services and (iv) our expanded service offerings and solutions, such as portable self-storage and long distance moving services, fluorescent lamp recycling, and interests we hold in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business. The following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015: • A $66 million charge related to impairments of oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015; • Our energy related businesses’ results were higher in 2016 principally driven by an increase in remediation services costs to industrial customers in 2015; • Increased WMSBS costs, driven in part by the transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2016; and • Increased expenses in 2016 from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items related to a loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company and goodwill impairments, primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit. The following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014: • Net charges of $66 million and $339 million primarily related to impairments of oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015 and 2014, respectively; • Our energy related businesses’ results were lower in 2015 principally driven by an increase in remediation services costs to industrial customers in 2015; and • The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2015. Corporate and Other The following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015: • Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to higher incentive compensation costs, severance costs, health and welfare costs and merit increases; • An increase in a subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas in 2016; • Decreased risk management costs in 2016; and • The transfer of certain sales employees to our Other segment from this segment in 2016. The following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014: • Restructuring costs related to our August 2014 reorganization and subsequent benefits resulting from our restructuring efforts; • Lower health and welfare costs in 2015 primarily driven by lower claims and reduced headcount; • The transfer of certain sales employees to our Solid Waste and Other segments from this segment in 2015; • Continued focus on controlling costs resulting in lower professional fees, telecommunications, contract labor, and travel and entertainment in 2015; 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Charges for the settlement of a legal dispute and related fees in 2014; • Unfavorable adjustments in 2014 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets to present value; and • Increased risk management costs in 2015 primarily related to certain higher than anticipated general liability claim settlements and a favorable risk management allocation in 2014. Wheelabrator — The most significant item affecting the results of operations of our Wheelabrator business in 2014 was a $519 million gain on sale of this business in December 2014. Interest Expense, net Our interest expense, net was $376 million in 2016, $385 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014. During 2016, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the impacts of lower market interest rates on certain of our tax-exempt bonds, partially offset by increased borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. During 2015, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of make-whole redemptions of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1%. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $555 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. We replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations. The “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2015 includes $122 million of charges related to make-whole redemptions and $430 million of charges related to cash tender offers. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $44 million, $38 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Provision for Income Taxes. Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. The amount in 2014 includes charges of $11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value. Other, net We recognized other, net expense of $50 million, $7 million and $29 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by impairment charges of $42 million, $5 million and $22 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies. In addition, we recognized $8 million of expense during the first quarter of 2016 associated with the termination of our cross-currency swaps, which is discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded provisions for income taxes of $642 million, $308 million and $413 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These tax provisions resulted in effective income tax rates of 35.2%, 29.1% and 23.6% for the 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes, as discussed above; (ii) federal tax credits; (iii) tax audit settlements; (iv) the realization of state net operating losses and credits; (v) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes and (vi) the tax implications of impairments and divestitures. The impacts of these items are summarized below: • Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits — Our low-income housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our provision for income taxes by $55 million, $57 million and $58 million, primarily as a result of the tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. • Other Federal Tax Credits — During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility, resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $14 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively. • Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $11 million, $10 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. • State Net Operating Losses and Credits — During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $10 million, $17 million and $16 million, respectively. • Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes – Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state laws resulted in a reduction of $10 million, $18 million and $24 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. • Tax Implications of Impairments — A portion of the impairment charges recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have been reduced by $15 million, $2 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our impairment charges. • Tax Implications of Divestitures — During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. During 2015, the Company recorded an additional $10 million net gain primarily related to post-closing adjustments on the Wheelabrator divestiture and had this gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $4 million. During 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $9 million related to the divestiture of certain assets and had the associated tax loss been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have decreased by $5 million. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our divestitures. Based on current tax laws and regulations, we expect our 2017 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items. Noncontrolling Interests Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014. The income for 2014 was principally related to third-parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that owned three waste-to- 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from the third parties. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities, respectively. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2016 and 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2015. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended December 31 and remaining capacity, measured in cubic yards of waste, at December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity RemainingPermittedCapacity ExpansionCapacity TotalCapacity Balance at beginning of year (in tons) 4,728 304 5,032 4,660 275 4,935 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures — — — 32 4 36 Changes in expansions pursued(a) — 77 77 — 105 105 Expansion permits granted(b) 166 (166 ) — 82 (82 ) — Airspace consumed (104 ) — (104 ) (97 ) — (97 ) Changes in engineering estimates and other(c) (36 ) 4 (32 ) 51 2 53 Balance at end of year (in tons) 4,754 219 4,973 4,728 304 5,032 Balance at end of year (in cubic yards) 4,787 200 4,987 4,740 298 5,038 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any. (b) We received expansion permits at 13 of our landfills during 2016 and six of our landfills during 2015, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The tons received at our landfills in 2016 and 2015 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2016 2015 # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay # ofSites TotalTons Tons perDay Solid waste landfills 243 (a) 104,913 384 244 96,777 355 Hazardous waste landfills. 5 646 2 5 567 2 248 105,559 386 249 97,344 357 Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 2 — 5 960 105,559 (b) 98,304 (b) (a) In 2016, we developed one landfill, our contract expired at one landfill and we closed one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.2 million tons at both December 31, 2016 and 2015, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2016, our closed sites management group managed 213 closed landfills. Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2016 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 16 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 47 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2016, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: # of Landfills 0 to 5 years 22 6 to 10 years 27 11 to 20 years 23 21 to 40 years 76 41+ years 100 Total 248 (a) (a) Of the 248 landfills, 200 are owned, 35 are operated under lease agreements and the remaining 13 are operated under other contractual agreements. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of these landfills. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2016, we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. We performed tests of recoverability for eight of these landfills and during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $43 million charge to impair one of these landfills in Western Pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes. For the other seven landfills, with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $281 million, the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining seven landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 are reflected in the table below: Cost Basis ofLandfill Assets AccumulatedLandfill AirspaceAmortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2015 $ 13,772 $ (7,925 ) $ 5,847 Capital additions 488 — 488 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 55 — 55 Amortization of landfill airspace — (428 ) (428 ) Foreign currency translation 28 (9 ) 19 Asset retirements and other adjustments (67 ) 22 (45 ) December 31, 2016 $ 14,276 $ (8,340 ) $ 5,936 As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2017, and approximately $900 million in 2018 and 2019 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 are reflected in the table below (in millions): Landfill EnvironmentalRemediation December 31, 2015 $ 1,518 $ 209 Obligations incurred and capitalized 59 — Obligations settled (91 ) (24 ) Interest accretion 91 3 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (1 ) 58 December 31, 2016 $ 1,576 $ 246 Landfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 91 $ 89 $ 88 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets — 1 14 Leachate and methane collection and treatment(a) 176 96 84 Landfill remediation costs 15 5 9 Other landfill site costs 70 64 71 Total landfill operating costs $ 352 $ 255 $ 266 (a) Leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased. Amortization of Landfill Airspace — Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following: • the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and • the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis for the years ended December 31: 2016 2015 2014 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 428 $ 409 $ 380 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 104 97 96 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.10 $ 4.21 $ 3.96 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 248 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt, payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 Cash and cash equivalents $ 32 $ 39 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds $ 95 $ 94 Other 10 11 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 105 $ 105 Debt: Current portion $ 417 $ 253 Long-term portion 8,893 8,676 Total debt $ 9,310 $ 8,929 We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2016 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt borrowings of $375 million and (ii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, discounts, premiums and deferred loan costs. As of December 31, 2016, the current portion of our long-term debt balance of $417 million includes (i) $230 million of short-term borrowings under our long-term $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (ii) 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $187 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $126 million of tax-exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2016, we have classified $196 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility as long-term because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a long-term basis. We generally use available cash to repay borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and any remaining balances are maintained by extending the maturities of the borrowings. Our current projections indicate that we will maintain $196 million of the $426 million of borrowings outstanding for the next 12 months. The remaining $230 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility is classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we also have $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and an additional $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. The interest rates on our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to use availability under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility to fund the debt obligations until they can be remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility at December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 $2.25 billion revolving credit facility(a) $ 789 $ 831 Other letter of credit facilities(b) 492 466 $ 1,281 $ 1,297 (a) In July 2015, we amended and restated our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility extending the term through July 2020. At December 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million. (b) As of December 31, 2016, we had utilized $492 million of other letter of credit facilities, which are both committed and uncommitted, with terms extending through December 2018. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,960 $ 2,498 $ 2,331 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,932 ) $ (1,608 ) $ 995 Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,035 ) $ (2,155 ) $ (2,072 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 are summarized below: • Increase in earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and unusual items, increased by $337 million on a year-over-year basis, principally driven 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements by earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business. Our 2015 results included $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, of which payments of approximately $60 million were made in 2015. • Cross-currency swaps — During the first quarter of 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps associated with the anticipated cash flows of intercompany loans between WM Holdings and its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the termination, we received cash proceeds of $67 million, which were classified as a change in “Other current assets” and “Other assets.” • Decrease in annual incentive plan cash payments — Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our cash flow from operating activities was favorably impacted by $46 million on a year-over-year basis, as the annual incentive cash payments made in 2016 were lower than the cash payments made in 2015. • Increase in income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was $36 million higher on a year-over-year basis largely driven by higher pre-tax earnings in the current year. • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted on a year-over-year basis due to net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2015 as compared with 2014 are summarized below: • Increased earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business — In 2015, we saw an increase in earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business, which was enhanced by acquisitions and corporate overhead cost reductions. These cash flow improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in earnings from our recycling operations. • Cash flow of divested businesses — The divestiture of Wheelabrator in December 2014 coupled with the sale of other Solid Waste businesses throughout 2014 negatively affected the year-over-year comparison by approximately $140 million. • Decrease in income tax payments — Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $329 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by (i) lower year-over-year pre-tax earnings primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015 and (ii) the income tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairment charges. • Decrease in interest payments — Cash paid for interest decreased $77 million primarily due to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes during 2015, which is discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. • Increase in annual incentive plan cash payments — Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted by approximately $65 million on a year-over-year basis, as the annual incentive plan payments made in 2015 were significantly higher than payments made in 2014. • Multiemployer Pension Plan settlements — In 2015, we paid approximately $60 million for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. • Forward-starting swaps — During the first quarter of 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured and we paid cash of 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $36 million to settle the liabilities related to these swaps, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This cash payment was classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.” • Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures — Our cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Capital expenditures — We used $1,339 million during 2016 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,233 million in 2015 and $1,151 million in 2014. The increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. In addition, the construction of a waste-water treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. Although, we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management. • Proceeds from divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $43 million in 2016, $145 million in 2015 and $2,253 million in 2014. In 2016 and 2015, $2 million and $79 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets. In 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. • Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $611 million, $554 million and $35 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, $525 million of our spending on acquisitions was for certain operations and business assets of SWS. The remainder of our 2016 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. In 2015, $400 million of our spending on acquisitions was for the collection and disposal operations of Deffenbaugh. The remainder of our 2015 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. All of our 2014 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. • Investments in unconsolidated entities — We made $21 million, $20 million and $33 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, our investments primarily consisted of additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility, which generates federal tax credits. In 2014, our investments primarily related to additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility and waste diversion technology companies. • Net receipts from restricted funds — Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts contributed $51 million and $19 million to our investing activities in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015, these activities were largely related to our replacement of funded trust and escrow accounts with alternative forms of financial assurance. • Other — Net cash used by our other investing activities was $4 million and $58 million in 2016 and 2014, respectively, and net cash provided by our other investing activities was $3 million during 2015. Net cash used by our other investing activities of $58 million during 2014 was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in the United Kingdom, prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: • Common stock repurchase program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We paid $725 million, $600 million and $600 million for share repurchases during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We announced in December 2016 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $750 million in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. • Cash dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. We paid aggregate cash dividends of $726 million, $695 million and $693 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.375 in 2014 to $0.385 in 2015 and to $0.41 in 2016 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program. In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.425 per share for dividends declared in 2017. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. • Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $63 million, $77 million and $93 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the number of stock options exercised and the exercise price of those options. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Debt borrowings (repayments) — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and debt repayments made for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Borrowings: $2.25 billion revolving credit facility $ 1,889 $ 100 $ 2,225 Canadian credit facility and term loan 347 11 88 Senior notes 496 1,781 347 Tax-exempt bonds 143 262 — Capital leases and other debt 182 183 157 $ 3,057 $ 2,337 $ 2,817 Repayments: $2.25 billion revolving credit facility $ (1,483 ) $ (80 ) $ (2,645 ) Canadian credit facility and term loan (193 ) (130 ) (243 ) Senior notes (510 ) (1,970 ) (350 ) Tax-exempt bonds (289 ) (341 ) (123 ) Capital leases and other debt (207 ) (243 ) (207 ) $ (2,682 ) $ (2,764 ) $ (3,568 ) Net borrowings (repayments) $ 375 $ (427 ) $ (751 ) Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments. • Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt — Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt were $2 million and $555 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was primarily related to (i) make-whole premiums paid on certain senior notes that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturities and (ii) premiums paid to tender certain high-coupon senior notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. • Acquisitions of and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests — The acquisitions of and distributions paid to our noncontrolling interests were $1 million, $1 million and $125 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The amount for 2014 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs related to our waste-to-energy facilities in December 2014 for $91 million. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the Wheelabrator divestiture, also in December 2014. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these LLCs. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities:(a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 119 $ 144 $ 110 $ 147 $ 109 $ 2,169 $ 2,798 Environmental remediation 28 21 29 63 17 88 246 147 165 139 210 126 2,257 3,044 Debt payments(b),(c),(d) 610 783 432 746 540 6,304 9,415 Unrecorded Obligations:(e) Interest on debt(f) 336 315 289 271 245 2,228 3,684 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 109 90 73 62 44 306 684 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(g) 179 149 112 92 88 336 956 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2016 $ 1,381 $ 1,502 $ 1,045 $ 1,381 $ 1,043 $ 11,431 $ 17,783 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding interest. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 include $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months. If the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums, deferred loan costs and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2016. For debt balances outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, we have reflected limited interest amounts due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. For debt balances outstanding under our Canadian term loan, we have reflected interest based on the current outstanding principal assuming the amount remains unchanged through maturity. As of December 31, 2016, we had $88 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations. (g) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2016, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standards Pending Adoption Income Taxes — In October 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the timing of recognition of income taxes for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs, which replaces current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows — In August 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Financial Instrument Credit Losses — In June 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements. Stock Compensation — In March 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with stock-based compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance with GAAP, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided. The amended guidance changes both the accounting and financial reporting for certain income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or provision rather than as a component of equity. The guidance also provides for changes in the calculation of forfeitures related to the expense of stock-based compensation. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this amended guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Leases — In February 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with lease accounting. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. The disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financial Instruments — In January 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition — In May 2014, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented (“full retrospective method”) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (“modified retrospective method”). To assess the impact of the standard, we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources. Our internal resources read the amended guidance, attended trainings and consulted with non-authoritative groups to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance. Surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact. Based on the results of these surveys, we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance. We also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results. We have completed our preliminary review of all contracts and are in the process of compiling and summarizing the results to determine whether additional review and analysis is necessary. Based on our work to date, we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance. We expect to quantify and disclose the expected impact, if any, of adopting this amended guidance in the third quarter Form 10-Q. While we are still evaluating the impact of the amended guidance, we currently do not expect it to have a material impact on operating revenues. Upon adoption of the amended guidance, we anticipate recognizing an asset from the capitalization of sales incentives as contract acquisitions costs. Under the amended guidance, sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. Currently, the Company expenses approximately $65 million in sales incentives annually. As noted above, we are still evaluating other possible impacts on our consolidated financial statements, including potential changes in the classification of certain revenue streams currently reported on a gross basis and on our disclosures. The Company is also currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2016. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had $9.4 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives, discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. We have $1.6 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months. Our variable-rate debt obligations include (i) $491 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $473 million of tax- exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months; (iii) $426 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (iv) $239 million of borrowings outstanding under our Canadian term loan. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately $15 million. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $595 million at December 31, 2016. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short-term maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India and investments in Hong Kong. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating costs. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. Historically, we hedged a portion of our foreign currency risk using currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. In March 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps. At termination, we received $67 million in cash for the fair value of the hedged position and reported this amount as a component of “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The realized loss from the termination did not materially affect our results of operations. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and translation. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 20:44:45.744771
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview for more information on our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following: · Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. · We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively. · A key element of our strategy is yield management through focus on price leadership, which has presented challenges to keep existing business and win new business at reasonable returns. We have also continued our environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee to offset costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases and our unwillingness to pursue lower margin volumes may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. Additionally, we have in the past and continue to face purported class action lawsuits related to our customer service agreements, prices and fees. · We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result. · We may not be able to maintain cost savings achieved through restructuring efforts. · Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. · Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, obtain regulatory approvals and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions. · Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others. 15 Table of Contents · Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. · Liabilities associated with acquisitions, including ones that may exist only because of past operations of an acquired business, may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than anticipated. · Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans. · We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. Compliance with existing or increased future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures, and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors. Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial and local level in the U.S. and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as: · limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities; · limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; · limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; · mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or · limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial. We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of, including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or third-party landfill operators, among other reasons. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The 16 Table of Contents permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations. Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The U.S. Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services. Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in the U.S. and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. The current U.S. presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. We cannot predict what impact the current administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the U.S., the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business. Reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our Company. Moreover, the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve. It is likely that some policies adopted by the current administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices, and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations that affect our ability to export products. Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and plastics, which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, and a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe, particularly China. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics and restrict the import of certain other plastic recyclables. In 2017, the Chinese government announced a ban on certain materials, including mixed waste paper and mixed plastics, effective January 1, 2018, as well as extremely restrictive quality requirements effective March 1, 2018 that will be difficult for the industry to achieve. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards. Also in 2017, the Chinese government began to limit the flow of material into the country by restricting the issuance of required import licenses. The use of restrictions on import licenses to restrict flow into China is expected to continue in 2018. There is uncertainty about the industry’s ability to adapt to the Chinese government’s regulations. We have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycled commodities, but it is possible there may not be sufficient demand for all of the material we produce, resulting in price decreases and increased volatility. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash flows positively, as we 17 Table of Contents experienced in 2017 and 2016, or negatively, as we experienced in 2015. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The increase in market prices in 2017 and 2016 for commodities resulted in increases in revenue of $237 million and $51 million, respectively. The decline in market prices in 2015 for commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of $138 million. Additionally, under some agreements, our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers. In some cases, if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. As we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall. If the Chinese government’s regulations, or other similar regulations or initiatives, such as increased container weight tracking and port fees or restrictions and tariffs on exporting, result in reduced demand or increased operating costs, such regulations, initiatives, restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our recycling operations. Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our EES organization. Demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices, such as the low prices throughout the last few years. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future. Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our EES organization. EES organization demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste and electronics at landfills. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives. 18 Table of Contents Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives. If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer. Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect new technologies. Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which: · agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and · local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments. Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in China could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations. Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results. We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had $831 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and $328 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If market dynamics resulted in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. 20 Table of Contents We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses. The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins. We have an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices. We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. However, natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. It will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program. We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. 21 Table of Contents Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage. Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions. Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives, which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans. We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, and we recognized related expenses of $12 million and $51 million in 2017 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, we did not recognize any charges for the withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans. See Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters. There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing 22 Table of Contents elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. We also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense. We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities. The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results. In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 23 Table of Contents Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile. If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third-party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have $1.8 billion of debt as of December 31, 2017 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program and our Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow. We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$50 million Canadian revolving credit facility (“Canadian revolving credit facility”) to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2020 and March 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had $642 million of letters of credit issued and $515 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program both supported by our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,093 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under both our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate. Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. 24 Table of Contents Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the Areas affected. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can increase our revenues in the Areas affected. While weather-related and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins. For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations. Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties. Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. From time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. We are also party to civil litigation. As a large company with operations across the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and employment-related claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to: · alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous materials and odors; · sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements, prices and fees; and · federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity. We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations. Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 25 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we occupy approximately 345,000 square feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and throughout Canada. Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our operating properties, vehicles and equipment are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional property and equipment for expansion, for replacement of assets and to support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2017. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Overview Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address the current needs, while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs, of our customers. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Our fundamental strategy has not changed; we remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement, with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions, the regulatory environment, asset and resource availability and innovation through technology. We believe that focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets, will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages. Simultaneously, we believe the combination of cost control, process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the Company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations. We believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry. Key items of our 2017 financial results include: · Revenues of $14,485 million for 2017 compared with $13,609 million in 2016, an increase of $876 million, or 6.4%. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) yield and volume growth in our collection and disposal lines of business, which contributed $536 million of revenues; (ii) higher market prices for recycling commodities, which contributed $237 million of revenue growth in our recycling line of business and (iii) increased fuel surcharge and mandated fees of $73 million; · Operating expenses of $9,021 million in 2017, or 62.3% of revenues, compared with $8,486 million, or 62.4% of revenues, in 2016. This increase of $535 million is primarily attributable to (i) increased cost of goods sold due to higher market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) higher volumes; (iii) increased maintenance and repairs costs; (iv) increased labor and related benefits costs, primarily due to merit and headcount increases and (v) increased fuel costs, primarily due to higher fuel prices and the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits. These increases were partially offset by decreased landfill leachate management costs; · Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,468 million in 2017, or 10.1% of revenues, compared with $1,410 million, or 10.4% of revenues, in 2016. This increase of $58 million is primarily attributable to (i) the impact of favorable litigation settlements in 2016; (ii) merit increases; (iii) an increase in certain costs that vary with revenue and earnings growth, including incentive compensation accruals; (iv) higher severance costs and (v) charitable contributions made for hurricane relief efforts; · Income from operations of $2,636 million, or 18.2% of revenues, in 2017 compared with $2,296 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2016, an increase of $340 million; 30 Table of Contents · Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,949 million, or $4.41 per diluted share, for 2017 as compared with $1,182 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for 2016; and · In 2017, we returned $1,500 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $1,451 million in 2016. Our business performed exceptionally well in 2017, as our strategy of improving pricing, adding profitable volume and controlling costs led to another year of significant earnings improvement. Our focus on delivering exceptional customer service while bolstering employee engagement yielded consistently positive operational performance throughout the year. Our cash flow generation has also continued to exceed expectations, allowing us to invest in assets that support continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation and return $1.5 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in 2017. The success that we achieved in 2017 reinforces our foundation for earnings and cash flow growth in 2018, despite anticipated disruption and downward price pressure in the global market for recycling commodities. With the reduction in our cash taxes due to enactment of tax reform, we are investing in our front-line employees, technology and revenue generating assets to continue to grow our business and improve customer service. These investments, together with our long-held commitments to maintain a strong balance sheet, return cash to shareholders and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities, position the Company to capitalize on its momentum as we work to deliver superior performance again in 2018. The following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2017 results were affected by the following: · An income tax benefit of $529 million related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, consisting of a net tax benefit of $595 million for the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by income tax expense of $66 million for a one-time, mandatory transition tax on the deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings. This net tax benefit had a favorable impact of $1.20 on our diluted earnings per share; · The recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating to $36 million, primarily related to (i) $37 million of impairment charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies; (ii) $34 million of goodwill impairment charges for certain ancillary services businesses; (iii) an $11 million charge for the withdrawal from an underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plan; (iv) $11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas and (v) a charge of $6 million related to the early extinguishment of $590 million of 6.1% senior notes. These charges were partially offset by gains of $31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and a $30 million reduction in post-closing, performance-based contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our EES organization. These net charges had a negative impact of $0.08 on our diluted earnings per share; and · Income tax benefit of $32 million for excess tax benefits related to the vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards, which had a favorable impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share. Our 2016 results were affected by the following: · The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating to $151 million, primarily related to (i) a $43 million impairment charge due to a loss of expected volumes for a landfill; (ii) a $42 million charge to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas; (iii) $41 million of impairment charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies; (iv) a $10 million goodwill impairment charge related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (v) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. These charges had a negative impact of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per share. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash 31 Table of Contents provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 3,180 $ 3,006 $ 2,528 Capital expenditures (1,509) (1,339) (1,233) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) 99 43 145 Free cash flow (a) $ 1,770 $ 1,710 $ 1,440 (a) Prior year information has been revised to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016‑09, which is discussed below in Adoption of New Accounting Standards, and conform to our current year presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $174 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016, impacted by (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste and recycling businesses and (ii) favorable changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures. These increases were partially offset by (i) higher income tax payments of $120 million in 2017; (ii) cash proceeds of $67 million from the termination of our cross-currency swaps in 2016 and (iii) higher annual incentive plan cash payments of $41 million in 2017. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $478 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015, impacted by (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste and recycling businesses; (ii) cash proceeds of $67 million from the termination of our cross-currency swaps in 2016; (iii) Multiemployer Pension Plan settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iv) lower annual incentive plan cash payments of $46 million in 2016; partially offset by higher income tax payments of $23 million in 2016. Additionally, we experienced favorable changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals. Capital expenditures increased by $170 million when comparing 2017 with 2016 and $106 million when comparing 2016 with 2015. The Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management and fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities, growth in our existing business, timing of replacement of aging assets and investment in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. Acquisitions Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling (“SWS”) — On January 8, 2016, Waste Management Inc. of Florida, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of SWS in Southern Florida for total consideration of $525 million. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial and industrial solid waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”) — On March 26, 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest, for total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $400 million. Deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills. 32 Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Standards Equity-Based Compensation — In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016‑09 associated with equity-based compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance with GAAP, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided. This amended guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and required the following changes to the presentation of our financial statements: · Excess tax benefits or deficiencies for share-based payments are now recorded as a discrete item in the period shares vest or stock options are exercised as an adjustment to income tax expense or benefit rather than additional paid-in capital. This change was applied prospectively as of January 1, 2017. The Company did not have any excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized as of January 1, 2017. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the current year impact; · As of January 1, 2017, the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding was changed prospectively to no longer include excess tax benefits as assumed proceeds. This change did not have a material impact on our current year diluted earnings per share; · Cash flows related to excess tax benefits or deficiencies are included in net cash provided by operating activities rather than as a financing activity. The Company adopted this change retrospectively, which resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding increase to net cash used in financing activities of $28 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively; · Cash paid to taxing authorities when withholding shares from an employee’s vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards for tax-withholding purposes is now considered a repurchase of the Company’s equity instruments and is classified as net cash used in financing activities rather than as an operating activity. The Company adopted this change retrospectively, which resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding increase to net cash used in financing activities of $18 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and · The Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures rather than account for forfeitures as they occur. Goodwill Impairment Testing — In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017‑04 which simplifies the goodwill impairment test by eliminating Step 2 of the quantitative assessment and should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment. Under the amended guidance, when a quantitative assessment is required, an entity will perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s estimated fair value, not to exceed the total amount of recorded goodwill. This amended guidance, effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, permits early adoption. The Company’s early adoption on January 1, 2017 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: · Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; · We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; 34 Table of Contents · There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and · Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 15 landfill sites with expansions included as of December 31, 2017, three landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. One landfill required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the expansion process. The remaining two landfills required approval because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include PRP investigations, settlements, and certain legal 35 Table of Contents and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: · Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; · Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; · The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and · The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. Long-Lived Asset Impairments We assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. If necessary, impairments are recorded in (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Property and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. 36 Table of Contents Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs. We assess whether an impairment exists using a quantitative assessment. Our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. In December 2017, we elected to use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. We continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with third-party insurers. In addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a wholly-owned insurance captive, we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims. WM will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive, typically in the first quarter of the year comprised of equal parts cash and an intercompany note, for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis. These premiums will be held in a restricted escrow account to be used solely for paying insurance claims, resulting in a transfer of risk from WM to the insurance captive. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF 37 Table of Contents and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our WMSBS and EES organizations, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and expanded service offerings and solutions. Our expanded service offerings and solutions include (i) portable self-storage and long distance moving services; (ii) fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program; (iii) portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let® and (iv) street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented in our “Other” segment in the table below. The following table summarizes revenues during the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Solid Waste $ 14,832 $ 13,968 $ 13,285 Other 2,538 2,278 2,065 Intercompany (2,885) (2,637) (2,389) Total $ 14,485 $ 13,609 $ 12,961 The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Commercial $ 3,714 $ 3,480 $ 3,332 Residential 2,528 2,487 2,499 Industrial 2,583 2,412 2,252 Other 439 423 356 Total collection 9,264 8,802 8,439 Landfill 3,370 3,110 2,919 Transfer 1,591 1,512 1,377 Recycling 1,432 1,221 1,163 Other (a) 1,713 1,601 1,452 Intercompany (b) (2,885) (2,637) (2,389) Total $ 14,485 $ 13,609 $ 12,961 (a) The “Other” line of business includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) our landfill gas-to-energy operations; (iii) certain services within our EES organization, including our construction and remediation services and our services associated with the disposal of fly ash and (iv) our expanded service offerings and solutions, such as portable self-storage and long distance moving services, and interests we hold in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” line of business reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support, net of intercompany activity.

(b) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. We also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. The following table summarizes the period-to-period change in revenues from average yield on a related business basis (dollars in millions): 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 As a % of As a % of Related Related Amount Business(i) Amount Business(i) Average yield: Collection and disposal $ 241 2.0 % $ 267 2.4 % Recycling commodities 237 20.1 51 4.6 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 73 16.3 (67) (13.1) Total $ 551 4.1 % $ 251 1.9 % (i) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year. Our revenues increased $876 million, or 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the prior year, driven primarily by (i) higher volumes; (ii) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal lines of business (iii) higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and (iv) higher revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to higher diesel fuel prices. Our revenues increased $648 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year, driven by (i) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (ii) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal lines of business; (iii) higher volumes and (iv) higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were (i) lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to lower diesel fuel prices; (ii) divestitures and (iii) foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our Canadian operations. The following provides further details about our period-to-period change in revenues: Average Yield Collection and Disposal Average Yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and 39 Table of Contents disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $241 million, or 2.0%, and $267 million, or 2.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2017 and 2016. The period-to-period changes are as follows (dollars in millions): 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 As a % of As a % of Related Related Amount Business Amount Business Commercial $ 99 3.0 % $ 130 4.2 % Industrial 69 3.1 59 2.8 Residential 44 1.8 46 1.9 Total collection 212 2.6 235 3.0 Landfill 17 0.9 15 0.8 Transfer 12 1.5 17 2.5 Total collection and disposal $ 241 2.0 % $ 267 2.4 % Our increase in collection and disposal yield for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, compared with the prior years, includes increased revenues from our environmental fees of $67 million and $72 million, respectively. Recycling Commodities — Increases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue growth of $237 million and $51 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared with the prior years due to the increase in the market prices of the recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage business. However, beginning in September 2017, disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities and the impact of natural disasters along the Gulf Coast decreased market prices for recycling commodities, which reduced our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the prior year period. We expect these disruptions in the market for recycling commodities to extend through the first half of 2018, which will continue to put downward pressure on average market prices for recycling commodities. Fuel Surcharges and Mandated Fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, increased $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with the prior years. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. Market prices for diesel fuel increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the prior years. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These fees did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the periods presented. Volume Our revenues from volume increased $289 million, or 2.1%, and $186 million, or 1.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared with the prior years. The comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions. We experienced higher volumes due to improving market conditions and strong sales performance. Our focus on customer service and disciplined growth delivered consistent results throughout 2017 and 2016. The most significant contributors to our volume growth were commercial and industrial collection; municipal solid waste and construction and demolition landfills; and transfer stations. Our residential line of business experienced volume declines in 2017 and 2016 due to our continued focus on renegotiating existing contracts and winning only those new contracts with a reasonable rate of return. 40 Table of Contents Additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2017 to 2016 are as follows: · Over $60 million of our landfill volume increases resulted from events during 2017 that may not repeat, including natural disasters throughout the U.S. primarily in the fourth quarter of 2017 and from an eleven-month outage at a waste-to-energy facility in Virginia that ended in mid-December; · Two large new contract additions in 2017 that favorably impacted our volume growth; · Our WMSBS organization experienced favorable volume growth; · The completion of certain project work performed throughout 2016 in our collection line of business in Southern California and other line of business from our EES organization negatively impacted our volume growth; and · One less workday in 2017 negatively impacted our volume growth. Additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows: · In our ancillary services businesses, we experienced higher volumes in 2016 as compared with 2015 resulting from our EES organization, particularly our remediation and construction services, our WM Renewable Energy organization and our portable self-storage business. These volume increases were partially offset by lower volumes due to lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business; and · An additional workday in 2016 favorably impacted our volume growth. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions increased revenues $48 million and $268 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared with the prior years. The increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. These revenues were partially offset by revenue decreases due to divestitures of $27 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared with the prior years. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business, including rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. 41 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period Period-to- Period 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Labor and related benefits $ 2,500 $ 90 3.7 % $ 2,410 $ 29 1.2 % $ 2,381 Transfer and disposal costs 996 22 2.3 974 35 3.7 939 Maintenance and repairs 1,170 94 8.7 1,076 54 5.3 1,022 Subcontractor costs 1,236 43 3.6 1,193 56 4.9 1,137 Cost of goods sold 969 111 12.9 858 67 8.5 791 Fuel 375 75 25.0 300 (61) (16.9) 361 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 753 51 7.3 702 40 6.0 662 Landfill operating costs 328 (24) (6.8) 352 97 38.0 255 Risk management 219 27 14.1 192 (29) (13.1) 221 Other 475 46 10.7 429 (33) (7.1) 462 $ 9,021 $ 535 6.3 % $ 8,486 $ 255 3.1 % $ 8,231 Our operating expenses increased $535 million, or 6.3%, when comparing 2017 with 2016 and $255 million, or 3.1%, when comparing 2016 with 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.3% in 2017, 62.4% in 2016 and 63.5% in 2015. Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to (i) merit increases; (ii) increased headcount driven, in part, by higher volumes and (iii) charges for the withdrawal from certain Multiemployer Pension Plans. These cost increases were partially offset by one less workday in 2017. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to (i) merit increases; (ii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (iii) health and welfare cost increases; (iv) an additional workday in 2016 and (v) higher incentive compensation accruals. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans and (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business. Transfer and Disposal Costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by higher volumes. The increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by acquisitions, primarily SWS, and higher volumes. Maintenance and Repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by (i) higher third-party repairs and parts costs and (ii) higher labor costs due to increased headcount, merit increases, and retention and training efforts. The increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily driven by (i) higher labor and parts and supplies costs and (ii) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS. Subcontractor Costs — Increases in subcontractor costs in 2017 compared with 2016 were driven by higher volumes in our Solid Waste business and our WMSBS organization. The increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by acquisitions and higher volumes in our WMSBS organization. The increases for both years were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation and construction services to industrial customers. Cost of Goods Sold — The increase in cost of goods sold in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to higher market prices for recycling commodities, partially offset by lower costs due to (i) continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and (ii) the divestiture of a majority-owned organics company in 2016. The increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to (i) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) increased costs in our remediation and construction services business, partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers. 42 Table of Contents Fuel — The increase in fuel costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to (i) higher fuel prices; (ii) the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of December 31, 2016 and (iii) higher volumes in our collection line of business. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and (ii) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. The decrease in fuel costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by (i) lower fuel prices; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles; (iii) increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and (iv) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. The higher volumes in our collection line of business in 2016 partially offset these decreases. Disposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to higher landfill volumes and increased municipal franchise fees. The increase in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to (i) higher landfill volumes; (ii) increased municipal franchise fees and (iii) increased subcontracted remediation and construction services to industrial customers. Landfill Operating Costs — The most significant item impacting landfill operating costs for the periods presented was landfill leachate management costs, which were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher in 2016 compared to 2015. Risk Management — The increase in risk management costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to increases in certain uninsured losses. The decrease in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain uninsured losses and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation claims. Other — The changes in other operating costs in the reported periods were principally driven by favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions in 2016 and fluctuations in operating lease expenses. Operating lease expenses were higher in 2017 compared with 2016 and lower in 2016 when compared with 2015. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Labor and related benefits $ 1,000 $ 32 3.3 % $ 968 $ 94 10.8 % $ 874 Professional fees 102 5 5.2 97 (15) (13.4) 112 Provision for bad debts 42 2 5.0 40 4 11.1 36 Other 324 19 6.2 305 (16) (5.0) 321 $ 1,468 $ 58 4.1 % $ 1,410 $ 67 5.0 % $ 1,343 Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $58 million, or 4.1%, when comparing 2017 with 2016 and $67 million, or 5.0%, when comparing 2016 with 2015. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.1% in 2017 and 10.4% in 2016 and 2015. 43 Table of Contents Significant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to (i) merit increases; (ii) an increase in certain costs that vary with revenue and earnings growth, including incentive compensation accruals and (iii) higher severance costs for former executives in 2017. The increase in costs in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation accruals; (ii) merit increases; (iii) higher severance costs and (iv) acquisitions. Professional Fees — The decrease in professional fees in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to lower legal fees. Other — The increase in other expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2016 and charitable contributions made for hurricane relief efforts in 2017. The decrease in other expenses in 2016 compared with 2015 was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses include (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 40 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset. The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 783 $ 10 1.3 % $ 773 $ 13 1.7 % $ 760 Amortization of landfill airspace 497 69 16.1 428 19 4.6 409 Amortization of intangible assets 96 (4) (4.0) 100 24 31.6 76 $ 1,376 $ 75 5.8 % $ 1,301 $ 56 4.5 % $ 1,245 The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2017 as compared with the prior year is primarily due to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates. The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets during 2016 as compared with the prior year is primarily due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2016 as compared with the prior year is due to higher volumes at our landfills, partially offset by changes in our landfill estimates. 44 Table of Contents (Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net The following table summarizes the major components of (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 (Income) expense from divestitures $ (38) $ 9 $ (7) Asset impairments 41 59 89 Other (19) 44 — $ (16) $ 112 $ 82 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized net income of $16 million, primarily related to (i) gains of $31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and (ii) a $30 million reduction in post-closing, performance-based contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our EES organization. These gains were partially offset by (i) $34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our EES organization; (ii) $11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and (iii) $7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized net charges of $112 million, primarily related to (i) $44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (ii) a $43 million charge to impair a landfill in Western Pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes; (iii) $12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (iv) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net charges of $82 million, primarily related to (i) $66 million of charges to impair certain oil and gas producing properties as a result of declines in oil and gas prices; (ii) $18 million of charges to write down or divest certain assets in our recycling operations and (iii) a $5 million impairment of a landfill in our Western Canada Area due to revised post-closure cost estimates. Partially offsetting these charges was $7 million of net gains from divestitures, including a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. 45 Table of Contents Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 1,538 $ 108 7.6 % $ 1,430 $ 140 10.9 % $ 1,290 Tier 2 552 30 5.7 522 76 17.0 446 Tier 3 1,199 205 20.6 994 3 0.3 991 Solid Waste 3,289 343 11.6 2,946 219 8.0 2,727 Other (68) 32 (32.0) (100) 60 (37.5) (160) Corporate and Other (585) (35) 6.4 (550) (28) 5.4 (522) Total $ 2,636 $ 340 14.8 % $ 2,296 $ 251 12.3 % $ 2,045 All information presented has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2017 are summarized below: The following items affected both comparable periods: · Our Traditional Solid Waste business benefited from internal revenue growth; · Our recycling line of business was favorable principally due to higher market prices for recycling commodities; and · The impairment charge for a landfill in Tier 3 in 2016 due to a loss of expected volumes. In addition, the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016: · Higher labor and related benefits costs in the current year primarily due to merit increases and charges for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, primarily in Tier 3; · Decreased landfill leachate management costs in Tier 3; · Increased landfill amortization expense related to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates, primarily in Tier 3; and · Increased maintenance and repairs costs. In addition, the following items affected 2016 when compared with 2015: · Increased landfill leachate management costs in Tier 3 in 2016; · Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to merit increases, higher incentive compensation accruals and increases in health and welfare costs; · Charges of $51 million for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans in 2015 impacting all three tiers; and · Improvements in our recycling line of business due to cost reductions and charges to write down or divest certain recycling assets in 2015 in Tier 1 and Tier 3. Other — Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our EES and WM Renewable Energy organizations that are not included in operations of our reportable segments; (iii) our recycling brokerage services and (iv) our expanded service offerings and solutions, such as portable self-storage and long distance 46 Table of Contents moving services, fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker® program, and interests we hold in oil and gas producing properties. The following items affected both comparable periods: · Expenses from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items related to a loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company and the goodwill impairment charge associated with our LampTracker® reporting unit in 2016. The following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016: · Gains from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties in 2017; and · Goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by a reduction in contingent consideration obligations, in our EES organization. The following items affected 2016 when compared with 2015: · Impairment charges of $66 million related to oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015; · Our EES organization’s results were higher in 2016 principally driven by an increase in remediation and construction services costs to industrial customers in 2015; and · Increased costs in our WMSBS organization driven, in part, by the transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2016. Corporate and Other The following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016: · Charges in both years to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, primarily in 2016; · Higher labor and related benefits costs in the current year were primarily related to higher incentive compensation accruals, merit increases and severance costs; and · A favorable litigation settlement providing for the reimbursement of certain legal fees in 2016. The following items affected 2016 when compared with 2015: · Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to higher incentive compensation accruals, severance costs, health and welfare costs and merit increases; · An increase in a subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas in 2016; · Decreased risk management costs in 2016; and · The transfer of certain sales employees to our Other segment from this segment in 2016. Interest Expense, Net Our interest expense, net was $363 million, $376 million and $385 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher capitalized interest on certain projects under development and the early repayment of high-coupon senior notes and issuance of new senior notes at lower coupon interest rates in 2017. During 2016, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the impact of lower market interest rates on certain of our tax-exempt bonds, partially offset by increased borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. 47 Table of Contents Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $6 million, $4 million and $555 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. We replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations. The loss on early extinguishment of debt reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2015 includes $122 million of charges related to make-whole redemptions and $430 million of charges related to cash tender offers. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $68 million, $44 million and $38 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of $29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values. The remaining losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in Income Tax Expense. Refer to Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. Other, Net We recognized other, net expense of $8 million, $50 million and $7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were impacted by impairment charges of $11 million, $42 million and $5 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned investments in waste diversion technology companies. In addition, we recognized $8 million of expense during 2016 associated with the termination of our cross-currency swaps, which is discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $242 million, $642 million and $308 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 11.0%, 35.2% and 29.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years presented is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes, as discussed above; (ii) impacts of enactment of tax reform; (iii) federal tax credits; (iv) excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation transactions; (v) the tax implications of impairments; (vi) the realization of state net operating losses and credits; (vii) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes and (viii) tax audit settlements. The impacts of these items are summarized below: · Impacts of Enactment of Tax Reform — The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and is generally effective for tax years beginning January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts of the Act to the Company include a decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time, mandatory transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had an income tax benefit of $529 million consisting of a net tax benefit of $595 million for the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, partially offset by income tax expense of $66 million for the one-time, mandatory transition tax. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the impacts of enactment of the Act. · Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits — Our low-income housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our income tax expense by $51 million, $55 million and $57 million, primarily as a result of the tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. 48 Table of Contents · Other Federal Tax Credits — During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility, resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $13 million, $14 million and $15 million, respectively. · Equity-Based Compensation — The excess tax benefits related to the vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards reduced our income tax expense by $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our adoption of ASU 2016‑09. · Tax Implications of Impairments — Portions of the impairment charges recognized during the reported years are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our income tax expense would have been reduced by $15 million, $15 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our impairment charges. · State Net Operating Losses and Credits — During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $12 million, $10 million and $17 million, respectively. · Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes – Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state laws resulted in a reduction of $5 million, $10 million and $18 million in our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. · Tax Audit Settlements — The settlement of various tax audits resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $2 million, $11 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on current tax laws and regulations as modified by the Act effective January 1, 2018, we expect our 2018 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 26.0% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items. The estimated 2018 rate incorporates the benefit of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, as well as the impacts of other less material provisions included in the Act. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2017 and 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2016. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended December 31 and remaining capacity, measured in cubic yards of waste, as of December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance as of beginning of year (in tons) 4,754 219 4,973 4,728 304 5,032 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 6 — 6 — — — Changes in expansions pursued (a) — 65 65 — 77 77 Expansion permits granted (b) 98 (98) — 166 (166) — Airspace consumed (112) — (112) (104) — (104) Changes in engineering estimates and other (c) 53 — 53 (36) 4 (32) Balance as of end of year (in tons) 4,799 186 4,985 4,754 219 4,973 Balance as of end of year (in cubic yards) 4,815 169 4,984 4,787 200 4,987 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any. 49 Table of Contents (b) We received expansion permits at nine of our landfills during 2017 and 13 of our landfills during 2016, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. The tons received at our landfills in 2017 and 2016 are shown below (tons in thousands): 2017 2016 # of Total Tons per # of Total Tons per Sites Tons Day Sites Tons Day Solid waste landfills 244 (a) 112,849 415 243 104,913 384 Hazardous waste landfills 5 584 2 5 646 2 249 113,433 417 248 105,559 386 Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 1 139 2 — 113,572 (b) 105,559 (b) (a) In 2017, we acquired two landfills and we closed one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.8 million tons and 1.2 million tons as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2017, our closed sites management group managed 204 closed landfills. Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2017 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. 50 Table of Contents The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2017, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: # of Landfills 0 to 5 years 26 6 to 10 years 21 11 to 20 years 27 21 to 40 years 74 41+ years 101 Total 249 (a) (a) Of the 249 landfills, 201 are owned, 35 are operated under lease agreements and 13 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed tests of recoverability for seven of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $282 million, for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining eight landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 are reflected in the table below: Accumulated Cost Basis of Landfill Airspace Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2016 $ 14,276 $ (8,340) $ 5,936 Capital additions 498 — 498 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 100 — 100 Acquisitions 84 — 84 Amortization of landfill airspace — (497) (497) Foreign currency translation 71 (25) 46 Asset retirements and other adjustments (125) 74 (51) December 31, 2017 $ 14,904 $ (8,788) $ 6,116 As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2018, and approximately $1 billion in 2019 and 2020 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by 51 Table of Contents conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 are reflected in the table below (in millions): Environmental Landfill Remediation December 31, 2016 $ 1,576 $ 246 Obligations incurred and capitalized 69 — Obligations settled (105) (21) Interest accretion 92 4 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (a) (b) 33 23 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 10 (1) December 31, 2017 $ 1,675 $ 251 (a) The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes (i) a net increase of $19 million related to our year-end annual review of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations and (ii) an increase of $12 million primarily for enhancements of our gas and leachate collection systems at certain closed landfills. (b) Our environmental remediation liabilities include $11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Landfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 92 $ 91 $ 89 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets 3 — 1 Leachate and methane collection and treatment (a) 143 176 96 Landfill remediation costs 14 15 5 Other landfill site costs 76 70 64 Total landfill operating costs $ 328 $ 352 $ 255 (a) Leachate management costs have increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to 2015 because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased. Amortization of Landfill Airspace — Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses, includes the following: · the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and · the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event 52 Table of Contents and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis for the years ended December 31: 2017 2016 2015 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 497 $ 428 $ 409 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 112 104 97 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.44 $ 4.10 $ 4.21 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at our MRFs; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt, payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 22 $ 32 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Insurance reserves $ 203 $ — Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 101 95 Other 15 10 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 319 $ 105 Debt: Current portion $ 739 $ 417 Long-term portion 8,752 8,893 Total debt $ 9,491 $ 9,310 We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2017 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Table of Contents Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt borrowings of $172 million and (ii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums, foreign currency translation and terminated interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2017, the current portion of our long-term debt balance of $739 million includes (i) $515 million of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program and (ii) $224 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $167 million of tax-exempt bonds. We have $831 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and an additional $328 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. The interest rates on our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to refinance these bonds on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility as of December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 $2.25 billion revolving credit facility (a) $ 642 $ 789 Other letter of credit facilities (b) 507 492 $ 1,149 $ 1,281 (a) As of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing July 2020. We had $642 million of letters of credit issued and $515 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program, both supported by this facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,093 million as of December 31, 2017. (b) As of December 31, 2017, we had utilized $507 million of other letter of credit facilities, which are both committed and uncommitted, with terms extending through December 2018. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 3,180 $ 3,006 $ 2,528 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,379) $ (1,932) $ (1,608) Net cash used in financing activities (a) $ (1,811) $ (1,081) $ (2,185) (a) Prior year information has been revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016‑09 and conform to our current year presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2017 as compared with 2016 are summarized below: · Increase in Earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, and asset impairments and unusual items, increased by $287 million in 2017, principally driven by higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste and recycling businesses. 54 Table of Contents · Increase in Income Tax Payments — Cash paid for income taxes was $120 million higher in 2017, largely driven by higher earnings and timing of income tax payments. · Cross-Currency Swaps — During 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps associated with the anticipated cash flows of intercompany loans between WM Holdings and its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries, as discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the termination, we received cash proceeds of $67 million, which were classified as a change in other current assets and other assets. · Increase in Annual Incentive Plan Cash Payments — Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our net cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted by $41 million due to higher annual incentive plan cash payments made in 2017. · Changes in Assets and Liabilities, Net of Effects of Acquisitions and Divestitures — Our net cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by changes in assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above. The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared with 2015 are summarized below: · Increase in Earnings — Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, and asset impairments and unusual items, increased by $337 million, principally driven by higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste and recycling businesses. Our 2015 results included $51 million of charges for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans. · Cross-Currency Swaps — During 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps and received cash proceeds of $67 million, which were classified as a change in other current assets and other assets. · Decrease in Annual Incentive Plan Cash Payments — Our net cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by $46 million as the annual incentive cash payments made in 2016 were lower than the cash payments made in 2015. · Multiemployer Pension Plan Settlements — In 2015, we paid approximately $60 million for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans. · Increase in Income Tax Payments — Cash paid for income taxes was $23 million higher largely driven by higher earnings in 2016. · Changes in Assets and Liabilities, Net of Effects of Acquisitions and Divestitures — Our net cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by changes in assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: · Capital Expenditures — We used $1,509 million, $1,339 million and $1,233 million for capital expenditures in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management and fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities, growth in our existing business, the timing of replacement of aging assets and investment in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. · Net Receipts from Restricted Funds — Net cash received in 2017 from our restricted trust and escrow accounts of $243 million primarily relates to $172 million of cash received from tax-exempt bond trust funds and $75 million for reimbursement of insurance claims from a wholly-owned insurance captive. The tax-exempt bond trust funds received during 2017 relate to two issuances, for which the cash proceeds from the issuances are recognized as an investing cash inflow as qualifying capital expenditures are reimbursed from the trust fund. These activities were treated as a non-cash financing activity when borrowed. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these restricted trust and escrow accounts. 55 Table of Contents Net cash received in 2015 from our restricted trust and escrow accounts of $51 million relates to our replacement of funded trust and escrow accounts with alternative forms of financial assurance. · Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $200 million, $611 million and $554 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our 2017 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. In 2016, $525 million of our spending on acquisitions was for certain operations and business assets of SWS. The remainder of our 2016 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. In 2015, $400 million of our spending on acquisitions was for the collection and disposal operations of Deffenbaugh. The remainder of our 2015 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. · Proceeds from Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $99 million in 2017, $43 million in 2016 and $145 million in 2015. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, $62 million, $2 million and $79 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: · Debt Borrowings (Repayments) — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt (excluding our commercial paper program discussed below) for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Borrowings: $2.25 billion revolving credit facility $ 25 $ 1,889 $ 100 Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility 9 347 11 Senior notes 745 496 1,781 Tax-exempt bonds 124 143 262 Other debt 124 182 183 $ 1,027 $ 3,057 $ 2,337 Repayments: $2.25 billion revolving credit facility $ (728) $ (1,483) $ (80) Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility (146) (193) (130) Senior notes (590) (510) (1,970) Tax-exempt bonds (251) (289) (341) Other debt (192) (207) (243) $ (1,907) $ (2,682) $ (2,764) Net cash borrowings (repayments) $ (880) $ 375 $ (427) During 2017, we had $452 million of non-cash financing activities due to the initial funding of a wholly-owned insurance captive and tax-exempt bond borrowings. During 2016 and 2015, we did not have any significant non-cash investing and financing activities. Non-cash investing and financing activities are generally excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments. · Commercial Paper Program — During 2017, we had net cash borrowings of $513 million (net of the related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our commercial paper program. · Common Stock Repurchase Program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. 56 Table of Contents We paid $750 million, $725 million and $600 million for common stock repurchases during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We announced in December 2017 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.25 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. · Cash Dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. We paid aggregate cash dividends of $750 million, $726 million and $695 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.385 in 2015 to $0.41 in 2016 and to $0.425 in 2017 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program. In December 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.425 to $0.465 per share for dividends declared in 2018. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. · Proceeds from the Exercise of Common Stock Options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $95 million, $63 million and $77 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the number of stock options exercised and the exercise price of those options. · Premiums Paid on Early Extinguishment of Debt — Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt were $8 million, $2 million and $555 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was primarily related to (i) make-whole premiums paid on certain senior notes that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturities and (ii) premiums paid to tender certain high-coupon senior notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities: (a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 128 $ 178 $ 177 $ 125 $ 103 $ 2,549 $ 3,260 Environmental remediation 28 23 66 36 11 87 251 156 201 243 161 114 2,636 3,511 Debt payments (b) (c) (d) 737 302 754 549 592 6,667 9,601 Unrecorded Obligations: (e) Interest on debt (f) 327 320 303 276 261 2,203 3,690 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 101 83 72 54 31 248 589 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations (g) 143 113 95 87 20 325 783 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2017 $ 1,464 $ 1,019 $ 1,467 $ 1,127 $ 1,018 $ 12,079 $ 18,174 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding interest. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2017 include $831 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months. If the remarketings of our bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can 57 Table of Contents be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. These amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2017. For debt balances outstanding under our commercial paper program, we have reflected limited interest amounts due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. For debt balances outstanding under our Canadian term loan, we have reflected interest based on the current outstanding principal assuming the amount remains unchanged through maturity. As of December 31, 2017, we had $61 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations. (g) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2017, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standards Pending Adoption Income Taxes — In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑16 associated with the timing of recognition of income taxes for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs, which replaces current GAAP that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows — In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑15 associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑18 associated with the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and, upon adoption, the principal change for the Company will be in the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows, which will include substantially all of the restricted trust and escrow accounts reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financial Instrument Credit Losses — In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑13 associated with the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses 58 Table of Contents and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are assessing the provisions of this amended guidance and evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. Leases — In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑02 associated with lease accounting. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. The disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. We are assessing the provisions of this amended guidance and we have (i) formed an implementation work team; (ii) performed training for the various organizations that will be most affected by the new standard and (iii) acquired a software solution to manage and account for leases under the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments — In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑01 associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated and not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition — In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014‑09 associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented (“full retrospective method”) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (“modified retrospective method”). The Company is currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. To assess the impact of the standard, we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources. Our internal resources read the amended guidance, attended trainings and consulted with other accounting professionals to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance. Surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact. Based on the results of these surveys, we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance. We also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results. Based on our work to date, we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance. We currently do not expect the amended guidance to have a material impact on operating revenues. However, upon adoption of the amended guidance, certain sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized to selling, general and administrative expenses over the expected life of the customer relationship. Under current guidance, sales incentives are expensed as earned to selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the amended guidance resulted in a change in who we identify as a customer for certain arrangements. We anticipate payments to these customers will be a reduction in operating revenues. Under current guidance, these payments are recorded as operating expenses. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 35% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term 59 Table of Contents agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2017, we had $9.5 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $1.8 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of (i) $831 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months; (ii) $515 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program; (iii) $328 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process and (iv) $113 million of outstanding borrowings under our Canadian term loan. We currently estimate that a 100‑basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2018 interest expense by $15 million. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100‑basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $635 million as of December 31, 2017. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in fixed-income securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. 60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:36.629509

The ASR agreement completed in October 2018, at which time we received 0.4 million additional shares. At the beginning of October, subsequent to the completion of the July 2018 ASR agreement, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b‑18 of the Exchange Act for $48 million, inclusive of per-share commissions. At the end of October 2018, we entered into a new ASR agreement to repurchase $200 million of our common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Overview We are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. We own or operate the largest network of landfills in North America. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste efficiently and economically. We also use waste to create energy, recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity. Additionally, we are a leading recycler in North America, handling materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Our “Traditional Solid Waste” business excludes our recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S. 30 Table of Contents Our Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, described under Results of Operations below. Business Environment The waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry. However, customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills. Due to this, we monitor these developments to adapt our services offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs. Despite some industry consolidation in recent years, we encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private service providers based on pricing, service quality, customer experience and breadth of service offerings. We also encounter competition for acquisition and growth opportunities. Our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors, as increases and decreases in consumer spending, business expansions and construction starts generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and our revenues. Negative economic conditions, in addition to competitor actions, can make it more challenging to negotiate, renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins and customers may reduce their service needs. General economic factors and the market for consumer goods, in addition to regulatory developments, can also significantly impact commodity prices for recyclable materials we sell. Our operating expenses are directly impacted by volume levels; as volume levels shift, due to economic and other factors, we must manage our network capacity and cost structure accordingly. The generally favorable macro-economic environment, including steady spending by consumers and businesses and construction starts, has benefited our volume growth and gross margins in recent quarters. We are not expecting any significant shift in the near term, but there is increased market volatility and uncertainty about longer-term macro-economic indicators. Disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities, due in part to actions by the Chinese government, resulted in significantly lower average markets prices in 2018 compared to 2017; however, we currently expect market price declines for recycling commodities to moderate in 2019. The recycling industry is continuing to adapt to the heightened quality standards and regulations. In addition, we are also focusing on managing processing costs, developing alternative markets and educating customers to reduce contamination in the recycling stream. Current Year Financial Results During 2018, we continued to produce strong operating results from our Traditional Solid Waste business, driven by strong yield and volume growth in our collection and disposal business. Net income and earnings per diluted share both increased primarily as a result of the strong operating results from our Traditional Solid Waste business as well as the favorable impact on our effective tax rate due to enactment of tax reform. The Company continued its commitment to supporting both organic and inorganic growth during 2018, allocating $1,694 million of available cash to capital expenditures and $466 million to the acquisition of solid waste businesses. We also allocated $1,806 million to our shareholders during 2018 through common stock repurchases and dividends. 31 Table of Contents Key items of our 2018 financial results include: · Revenues of $14,914 million for 2018 compared with $14,485 million in 2017, an increase of $429 million, or 3.0%. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher volumes due to improving market conditions; (ii) increased yield in our collection and disposal business and (iii) increased recycling brokerage volumes, partially offset by (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) fluctuations in foreign currency and other; · Operating expenses of $9,249 million in 2018, or 62.0% of revenues, compared with $9,021 million, or 62.3% of revenues, in 2017. This increase of $228 million is primarily attributable to higher volumes and cost inflation in the current year period, partially offset by (i) changes in accounting for rebates and certain franchise fees required by the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and (ii) decreased cost of goods sold due to lower market prices for recycling commodities; · Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,453 million in 2018, or 9.7% of revenues, compared with $1,468 million, or 10.1% of revenues, in 2017. This decrease of $15 million is primarily attributable to lower incentive compensation accruals partially offset by increased professional fees and bad debt expense; · Income from operations of $2,789 million, or 18.7% of revenues, in 2018 compared with $2,636 million, or 18.2% of revenues, in 2017, an increase of $153 million; · Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,925 million, or $4.45 per diluted share, for 2018 as compared with $1,949 million, or $4.41 per diluted share, for 2017. The comparability is impacted by an increase in the effective income tax rate in the current year period of 19% compared with 11% in the prior year period primarily due to the one-time impacts associated with enactment of tax reform in late 2017. The current year was favorably impacted by (i) improved operating results in our Traditional Solid Waste business and (ii) net gains associated with the sale of certain hauling and ancillary operations. Partially offsetting these increases was lower earnings from our recycling line of business due to lower market prices for recycling commodities and the impairment of a landfill; · Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,570 million in 2018 compared with $3,180 million in 2017; and · Free cash flow was $2,084 million in 2018 compared with $1,770 million in 2017. The $314 million increase was a result of (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business; (ii) lower income tax payments associated with enactment of tax reform in late 2017 and timing of income tax payments and (iii) divestitures of certain hauling and ancillary operations partially offset by higher capital expenditures to support organic growth in our business. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. Refer to Free Cash Flow below for our definition of free cash flow, additional information about our use of this measure, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our WMSBS and EES organizations, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and certain other 32 Table of Contents expanded service offerings and solutions. These operations are presented in our “Other” segment in the table below. The following table summarizes revenues during the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Solid Waste $ 15,537 $ 14,832 $ 13,968 Other 2,487 2,538 2,278 Intercompany (3,110) (2,885) (2,637) Total $ 14,914 $ 14,485 $ 13,609 The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Commercial $ 3,972 $ 3,714 $ 3,480 Residential 2,529 2,528 2,487 Industrial 2,773 2,583 2,412 Other 450 439 423 Total collection 9,724 9,264 8,802 Landfill 3,560 3,370 3,110 Transfer 1,711 1,591 1,512 Recycling 1,293 1,432 1,221 Other (a) 1,736 1,713 1,601 Intercompany (b) (3,110) (2,885) (2,637) Total $ 14,914 $ 14,485 $ 13,609 (a) The “Other” line of business includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) our landfill gas-to-energy operations; (iii) certain services within our EES organization, including our construction and remediation services and our services associated with the disposal of fly ash and (iv) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions. In addition, our “Other” line of business reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support, net of intercompany activity. (b) Intercompany revenues between lines of business are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report. 33 Table of Contents The following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues and average yield (dollars in millions): 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 As a % of As a % of As a % of As a % of Related Total Related Total Amount Business(a) Amount Company(b) Amount Business(a) Amount Company(b) Collection and disposal $ 291 2.3 % $ 241 2.0 % Recycling commodities (273) (19.1) 237 20.1 Fuel surcharges and mandated fees 111 21.3 73 16.3 Total average yield (c) $ 129 0.9 % $ 551 4.1 % Volume 478 3.3 289 2.1 Internal revenue growth 607 4.2 840 6.2 Acquisitions 199 1.4 48 0.3 Divestitures (133) (0.9) (27) (0.2) Foreign currency translation and other (244) (1.7) 15 0.1 Total $ 429 3.0 % $ 876 6.4 % (a) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year. (b) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s total Company revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year. (c) The amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total Company. The following provides further details about our period-to-period change in revenues: Average Yield Collection and Disposal Average Yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $291 million, or 2.3%, and $241 million, or 2.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2018 and 2017. The period-to-period changes are as follows (dollars in millions): 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 As a % of As a % of Related Related Amount Business Amount Business Commercial $ 99 2.9 % $ 99 3.0 % Industrial 107 4.4 69 3.1 Residential 47 1.9 44 1.8 Total collection 253 2.9 212 2.6 Landfill 22 1.1 17 0.9 Transfer 16 1.9 12 1.5 Total collection and disposal $ 291 2.3 % $ 241 2.0 % Our increase in collection and disposal yield for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, compared with the prior years, includes increased revenues from our environmental fees of $74 million and $67 million, respectively. 34 Table of Contents Recycling Commodities — Fluctuations in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue decline of $273 million and revenue growth of $237 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared with the prior years. Disruptions in the global movement of recycling commodities began in September 2017 and continued throughout 2018. Average market prices for recycling commodities at the Company’s facilities were 40% lower in 2018 compared to 2017. We currently expect market prices for recycling commodities to moderate in 2019. Fuel Surcharges and Mandated Fees — These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, increased $111 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared with the prior years. These revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. Market prices for diesel fuel increased 20% and 15% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared with the prior years. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations where we are the primary obligor in the contractual arrangement. Volume Our revenues from volume increased $478 million, or 3.3%, and $289 million, or 2.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared with the prior years. The comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions. We experienced higher volumes throughout 2018 and 2017 due to our focus on customer service and disciplined growth, combined with favorable market conditions in our Traditional Solid Waste business. We have experienced significant volume growth with existing customers, particularly in our commercial collection business. The volume growth is the result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their businesses expand and grow to identify service upgrade opportunities. Contributors to our volume increase in both 2018 and 2017 included a large new contract addition in the second half of 2017 that continued to favorably impact volume growth for our commercial collection business into 2018. Additionally, a large contract executed in the second half of 2017 increased our volumes at our transfer stations with incremental volume additions during 2018 that will continue to favorably impact our volumes into 2019. The clean-up efforts of natural disasters throughout the U.S. in the second half of 2017 favorably affected our landfill volumes primarily in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 2016 but negatively impacted the comparability of volumes for 2018. Furthermore, our WMSBS organization experienced favorable volume growth in both 2018 and 2017. Additionally, a volume increase from our recycling brokerage services affected the comparability of volumes for 2018 and 2017. Drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2017 and 2016 included a volume increase from an eleven-month outage at a waste-to-energy facility in Virginia that ended in mid-December 2017 offset, in part, by one less workday in 2017 that negatively impacted our volume growth. Foreign Currency Translation and Other Fluctuations in foreign currency affect revenues from our Canadian operations. We also experienced revenue decline associated with the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and other changes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business, including certain rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill 35 Table of Contents operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and (x) other operating costs, which include gains and losses on sale of assets, telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Labor and related benefits $ 2,703 $ 203 8.1 % $ 2,500 $ 90 3.7 % $ 2,410 Transfer and disposal costs 1,105 109 10.9 996 22 2.3 974 Maintenance and repairs 1,255 85 7.3 1,170 94 8.7 1,076 Subcontractor costs 1,375 139 11.2 1,236 43 3.6 1,193 Cost of goods sold 783 (186) (19.2) 969 111 12.9 858 Fuel 409 34 9.1 375 75 25.0 300 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 598 (155) (20.6) 753 51 7.3 702 Landfill operating costs 331 3 0.9 328 (24) (6.8) 352 Risk management 235 16 7.3 219 27 14.1 192 Other 455 (20) (4.2) 475 46 10.7 429 $ 9,249 $ 228 2.5 % $ 9,021 $ 535 6.3 % $ 8,486 Percentage of revenues 62.0 % 62.3 % 62.4 % The increase in volumes in the current year periods, as discussed above in Operating Revenues, affect the comparability of operating expenses for the periods presented. In addition, cost inflation affects the comparability of operating expenses particularly between 2018 and 2017. Other significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by (i) volume growth in our collection line of business; (ii) a bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention and (iii) merit increases. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to (i) merit increases; (ii) increased headcount driven by higher volumes and (iii) charges for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans. These cost increases were partially offset by one less workday in 2017. Maintenance and Repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2018 and 2017 as compared with the prior year periods was primarily driven by (i) higher labor costs from volume growth and cost inflation and (ii) higher third-party service and parts costs. Cost of Goods Sold — The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) a change in accounting for certain customer rebates due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 in the current year period. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of ASU 2014‑09. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2017 as compared with 2016 was due to higher market prices for recycling commodities, partially offset by lower costs due to (i) continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and (ii) the divestiture of a majority-owned organics company in 2016. Fuel — The increase in fuel costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was due to higher market prices for diesel fuel, partially offset by the recognition of a $28 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits. We recognized the benefit in the first quarter of 2018 when the legislation was passed, though the credits relate to 2017 business 36 Table of Contents activity and these credits were not extended into 2018. The increase in fuel costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to (i) higher market prices for diesel fuel; (ii) the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of December 31, 2016 and (iii) higher volumes in our collection line of business. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and (ii) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. Disposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — The decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by the adoption of ASU 2014-09 in the current year period; specifically, certain franchise fees were treated as disposal fees and taxes in the prior year periods and are treated as a reduction in operating revenues in the current year period. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of ASU 2014-09. The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2017 as compared with 2016 is primarily due to higher landfill volumes and increased municipal franchise fees. Risk Management — The increase in risk management costs in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to increases in losses within our self-insured retention. Other — The decrease in other operating costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by net gains on sales of certain assets in the current year period. The increase in other operating costs in 2017 as compared with 2016 was principally driven by favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions in 2016 and higher operating lease expenses in 2017. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Labor and related benefits $ 957 $ (43) (4.3) % $ 1,000 $ 32 3.3 % $ 968 Professional fees 113 11 10.8 102 5 5.2 97 Provision for bad debts 53 11 26.2 42 2 5.0 40 Other 330 6 1.9 324 19 6.2 305 $ 1,453 $ (15) (1.0) % $ 1,468 $ 58 4.1 % $ 1,410 Percentage of revenues 9.7 % 10.1 % 10.4 % Significant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to (i) lower incentive compensation accruals in the current year period and (ii) severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017 partially offset by merit increases and a bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to (i) merit increases; (ii) higher incentive compensation accruals and (iii) higher severance costs for former executives in 2017. 37 Table of Contents Professional Fees — The increase in professional fees in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the investments we are making in technology to improve our operations and our customer service and higher legal fees. Provision for Bad Debts — Our provision for bad debts increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to (i) an increase in revenues and (ii) the bankruptcy of a strategic customer in our WMSBS organization. Other — The increase in other expenses in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher litigation settlements in 2018, which were partially offset by lower costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment as we continued to focus on controlling costs. The increase in other expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2016 and charitable contributions made for hurricane relief efforts in 2017. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses The following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to-Period Period-to-Period 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment $ 838 $ 55 7.0 % $ 783 $ 10 1.3 % $ 773 Amortization of landfill airspace 538 41 8.2 497 69 16.1 428 Amortization of intangible assets 101 5 5.2 96 (4) (4.0) 100 $ 1,477 $ 101 7.3 % $ 1,376 $ 75 5.8 % $ 1,301 Percentage of revenues 9.9 % 9.5 % 9.6 % The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures to support organic growth in our business. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2018 and 2017 as compared with the prior year periods is primarily due to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates. (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net The following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 (Gain) loss from divestitures $ (96) $ (38) $ 9 Asset impairments 38 41 59 Other — (19) 44 $ (58) $ (16) $ 112 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized net gains of $58 million, primarily related to (i) a $52 million gain associated with the sale of certain hauling operations in Tier 1 and (ii) net gains of $44 million substantially all from divestitures of certain ancillary operations. These gains were partially offset by (i) a $30 million charge to impair a landfill in Tier 3 based on an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis, taking into account continued volume decreases and revised capping cost estimates and (ii) $8 million of impairment charges primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized net gains of $16 million, primarily related to (i) gains of $31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and (ii) a $30 million reduction in post-closing, performance-based contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our EES organization. These gains were partially offset by (i) $34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our EES organization; (ii) $11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental 38 Table of Contents remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and (iii) $7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized net charges of $112 million, primarily related to (i) $44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (ii) a $43 million charge to impair a landfill in Tier 3 due to a loss of expected volumes; (iii) $12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (iv) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. Income from Operations The following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions): Period-to- Period-to- Period Period 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Solid Waste: Tier 1 $ 1,642 $ 104 6.8 % $ 1,538 $ 108 7.6 % $ 1,430 Tier 2 542 (10) (1.8) 552 30 5.7 522 Tier 3 1,211 12 1.0 1,199 205 20.6 994 Solid Waste 3,395 106 3.2 3,289 343 11.6 2,946 Other (66) 2 (2.9) (68) 32 (32.0) (100) Corporate and Other (540) 45 (7.7) (585) (35) 6.4 (550) Total $ 2,789 $ 153 5.8 % $ 2,636 $ 340 14.8 % $ 2,296 Percentage of revenues 18.7 % 18.2 % 16.9 % Our segments are discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2018 are summarized below: The following items affected both comparable periods: · Our Solid Waste business benefited from internal revenue growth offset, in part, by merit increases and increased maintenance and repair costs. In addition, the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017: · Our income from operations for our Solid Waste business benefited from certain federal natural gas fuel credits in the first quarter of 2018 and was negatively impacted by (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) higher operating costs, including a bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention and (iii) increased depreciation and amortization expenses to support growth of our business. During 2018, Tier 1 also benefited from the divestiture of certain hauling operations and Tier 3 was negatively impacted by an impairment of a landfill. In addition, the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016: · Our Solid Waste business benefited from (i) higher market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) decreased landfill leachate management costs in Tier 3 and (iii) an impairment charge for a landfill in Tier 3 in 2016. However, our income from operations was negatively impacted by (i) charges for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, primarily in Tier 3 and (ii) increased landfill amortization expense related to higher volumes at our landfills and changes in our landfill estimates, primarily in Tier 3. 39 Table of Contents Other — In 2018 compared with 2017, our Other segment benefited from net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations and improved results in our EES and WM Renewable Energy businesses, partially offset by higher risk management costs. A reduction in contingent consideration obligations in our EES business favorably affected 2017 when compared with 2016. Corporate and Other — Corporate and other was affected by charges in 2016, and to a lesser extent in 2017, to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas. In addition, the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017: · Decreased expenses in 2018 as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals and severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher professional fees primarily due to the investments we are making in technology to improve our operations and our customer service in 2018. In addition, the following items affected 2017 when compared with 2016: · Increased expenses in 2017 as a result of higher incentive compensation accruals and severance costs. These increases were offset, in part, by a favorable litigation settlement in 2016. Interest Expense, Net Our interest expense, net was $374 million, $363 million and $376 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our 2017 interest expense benefited from higher capitalized interest on certain projects under development and the early repayment of high-coupon senior notes and issuance of new senior notes at lower coupon interest rates in 2017. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities We recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $41 million, $68 million and $44 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of $29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values. The remaining losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments, which are discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other, Net We recognized other, net income of $2 million in 2018 compared to other, net expense of $14 million and $54 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expenses for 2017 and 2016 were impacted by impairment charges of $11 million and $42 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned investments in waste diversion technology companies. In addition, we also recognized (i) $8 million of expense during 2016 associated with the termination of our cross-currency swaps, which is discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and (ii) a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6 million and $4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $453 million, $242 million and $642 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 19.0%, 11.0% and 35.2% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following: · Enactment of Tax Reform — For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized measurement period adjustments related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act primarily due to the filing of our income tax returns resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $12 million. The reduction consisted of a net income tax benefit of (i) $7 million for the remeasurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and other reserves 40 Table of Contents due to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate and (ii) a $5 million adjustment for the one-time, mandatory transition tax. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a reduction in our income tax expense of $529 million consisting of a net tax benefit of $595 million for the initial remeasurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, partially offset by income tax expense of $66 million for the one-time, mandatory transition tax. · Other Adjustments – We recognized reductions in our income tax expense of $92 million, $7 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, associated with adjustments to accruals and related deferred taxes and tax audit settlements. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to income taxes. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis We owned or operated 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2018 and 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2017. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended December 31 and remaining capacity, measured in cubic yards of waste, as of December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 Remaining Remaining Permitted Expansion Total Permitted Expansion Total Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance as of beginning of year (in tons) 4,799 186 4,985 4,754 219 4,973 Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 5 — 5 6 — 6 Changes in expansions pursued (a) — 72 72 — 65 65 Expansion permits granted (b) 42 (42) — 98 (98) — Airspace consumed (116) — (116) (112) — (112) Changes in engineering estimates and other (c) 32 4 36 53 — 53 Balance as of end of year (in tons) 4,762 220 4,982 4,799 186 4,985 Balance as of end of year (in cubic yards) 4,735 194 4,929 4,815 169 4,984 (a) Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any. (b) We received expansion permits at six of our landfills during 2018 and nine of our landfills during 2017, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills. (c) Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training. 41 Table of Contents The tons received at our landfills are shown below (tons in thousands): 2018 2017 # of Total Tons per # of Total Tons per Sites Tons Day Sites Tons Day Solid waste landfills 247 (a) 115,972 426 244 112,849 415 Hazardous waste landfills 5 739 3 5 584 2 252 116,711 429 249 113,433 417 Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 1 424 1 139 117,135 (b) 113,572 (b) (a) In 2018, we acquired four landfills and closed one landfill. (b) These amounts include 1.5 million tons and 1.8 million tons as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects. When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our environmental legacy management group. As of December 31, 2018, our environmental legacy management group managed 207 closed landfills. Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2018 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 43 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2018, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: # of Landfills 0 to 5 years 30 6 to 10 years 16 11 to 20 years 35 21 to 40 years 68 41+ years 103 Total 252 (a) (a) Of the 252 landfills, 204 are owned, 35 are operated under lease agreements and 13 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we have 16 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed tests of recoverability for seven of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $270 million, for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our 42 Table of Contents probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material. Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below. The changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected in the table below: Accumulated Cost Basis of Landfill Airspace Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill Assets December 31, 2017 $ 14,904 $ (8,788) $ 6,116 Capital additions 513 — 513 Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized 83 — 83 Acquisitions 2 — 2 Amortization of landfill airspace — (538) (538) Foreign currency translation (89) 35 (54) Asset retirements and other adjustments (173) 134 (39) December 31, 2018 $ 15,240 $ (9,157) $ 6,083 As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that we will spend approximately $600 million in 2019, and approximately $1.25 billion in 2020 and 2021 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated. The changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected in the table below (in millions): Environmental Landfill Remediation December 31, 2017 $ 1,675 $ 251 Obligations incurred and capitalized 83 — Obligations settled (108) (26) Interest accretion 95 5 Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (a) (b) (3) 9 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (c) 18 (2) December 31, 2018 $ 1,760 $ 237 (a) The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes a net decrease of $15 million primarily related to our year-end annual review of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations partially offset by an increase of 43 Table of Contents $12 million due to the acceleration of the expected timing of capping activities for a landfill. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment charge related to this landfill. (b) The amount reported for our environmental remediation liabilities includes changes in cost estimates associated with environmental remediation projects resulting in an increase in the required obligation. These charges were partially offset by a decrease of $3 million in our environmental remediation liabilities due to an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our liabilities from 2.5% at December 31, 2017 to 2.75% at December 31, 2018. (c) The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes an increase of $27 million due to landfill acquisitions partially offset by landfill divestitures and other adjustments. Landfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Interest accretion on landfill liabilities $ 95 $ 92 $ 91 Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets (2) 3 — Leachate and methane collection and treatment 150 143 176 Landfill remediation costs 13 14 15 Other landfill site costs 75 76 70 Total landfill operating costs $ 331 $ 328 $ 352 Amortization of Landfill Airspace — Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses, includes the following: · the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and · the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs. Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates. The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis for the years ended December 31: 2018 2017 2016 Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions) $ 538 $ 497 $ 428 Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions) 116 112 104 Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton $ 4.64 $ 4.44 $ 4.10 Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 252 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year. 44 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds its working capital needs, the payments of its dividend and investment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings, large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital, operating and other liquidity requirements. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 22 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Insurance reserves (a) $ 252 $ 203 Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds 103 101 Other 11 15 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 366 $ 319 Debt: Current portion $ 432 $ 739 Long-term portion 9,594 8,752 Total debt $ 10,026 $ 9,491 (a)Includes $70 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2018 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt cash borrowings of $313 million; (ii) our recent federal low-income housing investment discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and new capital leases, which increased our debt obligations by $250 million and (iii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances such as divestitures, debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums, foreign currency translation and terminated interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.9 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $990 million of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program; (ii) $705 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities; (iii) $161 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $106 million of tax-exempt bonds and (iv) C$15 million, or $11 million, of Canadian borrowings under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility. Of the $990 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2018 that are supported by our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, we have the intent and ability to refinance or maintain approximately $730 million of these borrowings on a long-term basis, and we have classified these amounts as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2018, we have classified an additional $705 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long-term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, as discussed below. The remaining $432 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations. 45 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2018, we also have $268 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility. The interest rates on our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the availability under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we have also classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018. We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility as of December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017 Revolving credit facility (a) $ 587 $ 642 Other letter of credit facilities (b) 556 507 $ 1,143 $ 1,149 (a) As of December 31, 2018, we had an unused and available credit capacity of $1.2 billion. (b) As of December 31, 2018, these other letter of credit facilities are both committed and uncommitted with terms extending through December 2020. Refinancing of Revolving Credit Facility In June 2018, we entered into the $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, which amended and restated our prior long-term U.S. revolving credit facility. Amendments to the credit agreement included (i) increasing total capacity under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion; (ii) establishment of a $750 million accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods; (iii) extending the term through June 2023 and (iv) inclusion of two one-year extension options. Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., each an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, were added as additional borrowers under the $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, and the agreement permits borrowing in Canadian dollars up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $375 million, with such borrowings to be repaid in Canadian dollars. WM Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, guarantees all of the obligations under the $2.75 billion revolving credit facility. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017(a) 2016(a) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,570 $ 3,180 $ 3,003 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,169) $ (1,620) $ (1,929) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,508) $ (1,361) $ (1,084) (a) Prior year information was revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016‑15 and ASU 2016-18 and conform to our current year presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — Our operating cash flows increased by $390 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with the prior year period, as a result of (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business and (ii) lower income tax payments of $213 million, driven by enactment of tax reform and timing of income tax payments partially offset by lower earnings from our recycling line of business. Our operating cash flows increased by $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with the prior year period, as a result of higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business and recycling line of business. 46 Table of Contents This increase is partially offset by cash paid for income taxes, which was $120 million higher in 2017, largely driven by higher earnings and timing of income tax payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: · Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $466 million, $200 million and $611 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $460 million, $198 million and $608 million, respectively, are considered cash used in investing activities. The remaining spend is either cash used in a financing or an operating activity related to the timing of contingent consideration paid subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-15. Substantially all of these acquisitions are related to our Solid Waste business. Our acquisitions in 2016 included $525 million for certain operations and business assets of Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling. See Notes 2 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings. · Capital Expenditures — We used $1,694 million, $1,509 million and $1,339 million for capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management and fluctuations in our capital expenditures are a result of new business opportunities, growth in our existing business, the timing of replacement of aging assets and investment in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. · Proceeds from Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $208 million, $99 million and $43 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, $153 million, $62 million and $2 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets. · Other, Net — Our spending within other, net was $223 million, $12 million, and $25 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018 is primarily due to changes in our investments portfolio associated with our wholly-owned insurance captive from restricted cash and cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: · Debt Borrowings (Repayments) — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt (excluding our commercial paper program discussed below) for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2018 2017(a) 2016(a) Borrowings: Revolving credit facility (b) $ 119 $ 302 $ 1,889 Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility 8 9 347 Senior notes — 745 496 Tax-exempt bonds 185 299 143 Other debt 47 124 182 $ 359 $ 1,479 $ 3,057 Repayments: Revolving credit facility (b) $ (108) $ (728) $ (1,483) Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility (117) (146) (193) Senior notes — (590) (510) Tax-exempt bonds (167) (251) (289) Other debt (107) (192) (207) $ (499) $ (1,907) $ (2,682) Net cash borrowings (repayments) $ (140) $ (428) $ 375 (a) Prior year information was revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 and conform to our current year presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (b) Our revolving credit facility was amended and restated in June 2018. During 2018, we had $250 million of non-cash financing activities from our recent federal low-income housing investment discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and new capital leases. During 2017 and 2016, we did not have any significant non-cash investing and financing activities. Non-cash investing and financing activities are generally excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments. · Commercial Paper Program — During 2018 and 2017, we had net cash borrowings of $453 million and $513 million (net of the related discounts on issuance), respectively, under our commercial paper program. Borrowings were primarily to support new business opportunities and for general corporate purposes. · Common Stock Repurchase Program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We repurchased $1,008 million, $750 million and $725 million of our common stock during 2018 (including $4 million paid in January 2019), 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We announced in December 2018 that our Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.5 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations. · Cash Dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. We paid aggregate cash dividends of $802 million, $750 million and $726 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.41 in 2016 to $0.425 in 2017 and to $0.465 in 2018 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program. 48 Table of Contents In December 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.465 to $0.5125 per share for dividends declared in 2019. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. · Proceeds from the Exercise of Common Stock Options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $52 million, $95 million and $63 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the number of stock options exercised and the exercise price of those options. Free Cash Flow As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies: 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 3,570 $ 3,180 $ 3,003 Capital expenditures (1,694) (1,509) (1,339) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) 208 99 43 Free cash flow (a) $ 2,084 $ 1,770 $ 1,707 (a) Prior year information was revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016‑18 and conform to our current year presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities: (a) Final capping, closure and post-closure $ 143 $ 170 $ 132 $ 105 $ 98 $ 2,450 $ 3,098 Environmental remediation 26 19 65 37 13 81 241 169 189 197 142 111 2,531 3,339 Debt payments (b) (c) (d) 1,166 780 584 622 614 6,382 10,148 Unrecorded Obligations: (e) Interest on debt (f) 340 319 291 278 254 2,101 3,583 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations 74 69 54 40 37 370 644 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations (g) 138 121 110 45 41 399 854 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2018 $ 1,887 $ 1,478 $ 1,236 $ 1,127 $ 1,057 $ 11,783 $ 18,568 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding interest. (c) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 include $705 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months. If the remarketings of our bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. These amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods. (e) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2018. For debt balances outstanding under our commercial paper program, we have reflected limited interest amounts due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. For debt balances outstanding under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, we have reflected interest based on the current outstanding principal assuming the amount remains unchanged through maturity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $82 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations. (g) Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event. Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization. Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace 51 Table of Contents is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography. Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria: · Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals; · We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; · There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and · Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment. For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements. After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that 52 Table of Contents expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include PRP investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: · Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites; · Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; · The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and · The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined. Long-Lived Asset Impairments We assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. If necessary, impairments are recorded in (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Property and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired. The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated 53 Table of Contents permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs. Beginning in 2018, we first performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicated a possible impairment, we completed a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge was recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods. Insured and Self-Insured Claims We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. In December 2017, we elected to use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. We continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with third-party insurers. In addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a wholly-owned insurance captive, we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims. WM will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive, typically in the first quarter of the year, for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis. These premiums are held in a restricted escrow account to be 54 Table of Contents used solely for paying insurance claims, resulting in a transfer of risk from WM to the insurance captive and are allocated between current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on timing on the use of funds. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2018, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standard Pending Adoption Leases — In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑02 associated with lease accounting. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. Disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required. We elected the optional transition method which allows entities to continue to apply historical accounting guidance in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. At transition, lessees and lessors may elect to apply a package of practical expedients permitting entities not to reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) whether initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases qualify for capitalization under the amended guidance. These practical expedients must be elected as a package and consistently applied. We have elected to apply the package of practical expedients upon adoption. We identified our leases or other contracts impacted by the new standard and are currently in the process of (i) finalizing our implementation of a software solution to manage and account for leases under the new standard and (ii) updating our business processes and related policies, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Upon adoption of the amended guidance, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and related liabilities of approximately $300 million to $350 million for our contracts which contain an operating lease. We currently do not expect the amended guidance to have any other material impacts on our consolidated financial statements. Inflation While inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 35% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. 55 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $10.1 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $2.2 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of (i) $990 million of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program; (ii) $705 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months; (iii) $513 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis and (iv) C$15 million, or $11 million, of Canadian borrowings under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility. We currently estimate that a 100‑basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2019 interest expense by $19 million. Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100‑basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $575 million as of December 31, 2018. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and equity securities. Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease. Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. 56 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:27.012520

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2019. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.OverviewWe are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. We own or operate the largest network of landfills in North America. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste efficiently and economically. We also use waste to create energy, recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity. Additionally, we are a leading recycler in North America, handling materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S.Our Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of 32 Table of Contentscollection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, described under Results of Operations below.Business EnvironmentThe waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry. However, customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills. We monitor these developments to adapt our services offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs.Despite some industry consolidation in recent years, we encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private service providers based on pricing, service quality, customer experience and breadth of service offerings. Our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors, including increases and decreases in consumer spending, business expansions and construction starts. These factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue. Negative economic conditions, in addition to competitor actions, can make it more challenging to negotiate, renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins and in addition, customers may reduce their service needs. We also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities. General economic factors and the market for consumer goods, in addition to regulatory developments, can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell. Our operating expenses are directly impacted by volume levels; as volume levels shift, due to economic and other factors, we must manage our network capacity and cost structure accordingly.In 2019, we have benefited from a generally favorable macro-economic environment, including steady spending by consumers and businesses, which have led to volume and gross margin growth. We experienced growth in our collection and disposal lines of business, particularly in the segments of our business driven by the consumer portion of the economy. Volume growth is also the result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their needs expand to identify service upgrade opportunities. Overall in 2019, our landfill volumes were favorably impacted by growth in our municipal solid waste business, clean-up efforts from natural disasters in California during 2019 and event-driven projects. The portion of our business driven by the industrial segment of the economy, such as special waste, continues to show growth, although the pace of growth is starting to moderate as large industrial customers take a more cautious approach to awarding work for special projects. Additionally, we continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets customers’ environmental needs, but is also economically sustainable. Given pressures on the business from lower market values for recycled commodities and higher contamination fees, we have been working to improve its financial returns by driving a fee-based pricing model that addresses the cost of processing materials and the impact on our costs of contamination. These efforts provided significant value to our 2019 results, though that value was more than offset by continued declines in market prices for recycled commodities. We will continue to take steps necessary to improve long-term profitability of our recycling line of business.Overall, the Company’s operations performed well in 2019. We expect the Company’s industry-leading asset network and strategic focuses on investing in people, technology and growth to drive continued growth in the year ahead.33 Table of ContentsCurrent Year Financial ResultsDuring 2019, we continued to produce strong operating results from our collection and disposal business, driven by favorable market conditions and our focus on delivering an outstanding customer experience and continuous improvement. The Company continued its commitment to supporting both organic and inorganic growth during 2019, allocating $1,818 million of available cash to capital expenditures and $527 million to the acquisition of solid waste businesses, of which $6 million was recorded as cash flow from financing activities related to the timing of contingent consideration paid. We also allocated $1,124 million to our shareholders during 2019 through dividends and common stock repurchases.Key items of our 2019 financial results include:●Revenues of $15,455 million for 2019 compared with $14,914 million in 2018, an increase of $541 million, or 3.6%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher yield and volumes in our collection and disposal business and (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by lower market prices for recycling commodities;●Operating expenses of $9,496 million in 2019, or 61.4% of revenues, compared with $9,249 million, or 62.0% of revenues, in 2018. The $247 million increase is primarily attributable to higher volumes and cost inflation in the current year period, partially offset by (i) decreased cost of goods sold primarily due to lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) the favorable impact of a year-over-year increase in federal natural gas fuel credits;●Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,631 million in 2019, or 10.6% of revenues, compared with $1,453 million, or 9.7% of revenues, in 2018. This increase of $178 million is primarily attributable to (i) higher costs associated with planned investments in our people and technology; (ii) increased acquisition-related costs and (iii) litigation reserves;●Income from operations of $2,706 million, or 17.5% of revenues, in 2019 compared with $2,789 million, or 18.7% of revenues, in 2018. Although 2019 benefited from strong operating results, primarily in our collection and disposal business, and the favorable impact of a year-over-year increase in federal natural gas fuel credits, cost inflation across various cost categories, costs associated with investments in our people and technology, acquisition-related costs and goodwill impairments drove a reduction in income from operations as compared with 2018. Additionally, 2018 was favorably impacted by net gains associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations and certain ancillary operations, partially offset by the impairment of a landfill;●Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. was $1,670 million, or $3.91 per diluted share, compared with $1,925 million, or $4.45 per diluted share, in the prior year period. In addition to the decrease in income from operations, the current year was impacted by (i) increased depreciation and amortization expense related to new collection fleet and increased landfill volume; (ii) an $85 million loss on early extinguishment of debt; (iii) a $52 million impairment charge related to our minority-owned investment in a waste conversion technology business that was not deductible for tax purposes and (iv) a $27 million impairment of goodwill. Additionally, the prior year period was favorably impacted by net gains associated with the sale of operations discussed above;●Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,874 million compared with $3,570 million in the prior year period; and●Free cash flow was $2,105 million compared with $2,084 million in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities noted above was offset by an increase in capital expenditures resulting from our intentional focus on accelerating certain collection fleet and landfill spending to support the Company’s strong collection and disposal growth and lower proceeds from divestitures, which resulted in free cash flow being $21 million higher on a year-over-year basis. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. Refer to Free Cash Flow within Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of free cash flow, additional information about our use of this measure, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.34 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsOperating RevenuesOur operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our WMSBS and EES organizations, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and certain other expanded service offerings and solutions. The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business is reflected in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Commercial​​$ 4,229​$ 3,972​$ 3,714Residential​​ 2,613​ 2,529​ 2,528Industrial​​ 2,916​ 2,773​ 2,583Other collection​​ 482​ 450​ 439Total collection​​ 10,240​ 9,724​ 9,264Landfill​​ 3,846​ 3,560​ 3,370Transfer​​ 1,820​ 1,711​ 1,591Recycling​​ 1,040​ 1,293​ 1,432Other (a)​​ 1,758​ 1,736​ 1,713Intercompany (b)​​ (3,249)​ (3,110)​ (2,885)Total​​$ 15,455​$ 14,914​$ 14,485(a)The “Other” line of business includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) our landfill gas-to-energy operations; (iii) certain services within our EES organization, including our construction and remediation services and our services associated with the disposal of fly ash and (iv) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions.

The following provides further details about our period-to-period change in revenues:Average YieldCollection and Disposal Average Yield — This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers.The details of our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield for the years ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017​​​​​​​As a % of ​​​As a % of​​​​​​​Related ​​​Related​​ ​Amount Business Amount Business Commercial​​$ 109​3.0 % $ 99​2.9 %Industrial​​ 103​4.0 ​ 107​4.4 ​Residential​​ 81​3.3 ​ 47​1.9 ​Total collection​​ 293​3.3 ​ 253​2.9 ​Landfill​​ 44​2.0 ​ 22​1.1 ​Transfer​​ 27​2.9 ​ 16​1.9 ​Total collection and disposal​​$ 364​2.8 % $ 291​2.3 %​36 Table of ContentsOur strategic pricing efforts focus on ensuring we overcome inflationary cost pressures and grow margins. This strategy has been most successful in our collection line of business for both 2019 and 2018. We are also experiencing solid growth in our landfill and transfer businesses, with our municipal solid waste business experiencing 3.8% and 2.2% average yield growth for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods.Recycling Commodities — Decreases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in revenue declines of $248 million and $273 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods. We partially offset our revenue decline by assessing fees to cover the higher costs of handling contaminated recycling materials. Average market prices for recycling commodities at the Company’s facilities were 35% lower in 2019 compared to 2018 and 40% lower in 2018 compared to 2017. We have seen a decreased demand from paper mills around the world which had driven prices to historical low averages. There are several domestic mill projects anticipated to start during 2020 that we expect will add additional capacity and more local demand for recycled materials. However, we do not expect material changes in market prices for recycling commodities as a result of this additional capacity. The cardboard packaging industry has been impacted by slower global demand, retail store closures and e-commerce packaging efficiency. We will continue to take steps necessary to improve long-term profitability of our recycling line of business.Fuel Surcharges and Mandated Fees — These fees, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, declined $22 million for 2019 and increased $111 million for 2018, as compared with the prior year periods. These revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel. Market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 4% and increased 20% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared with the prior year periods. The decline in fuel surcharges for 2019 was partially offset by an increase in mandated fees. The mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations.VolumeOur revenues from volume increased $346 million, or 2.3%, and $478 million, or 3.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures.We experienced higher volumes throughout 2019 and 2018 due to our focus on customer service and disciplined growth, combined with favorable market conditions in our collection and disposal business. We have experienced significant volume growth with existing customers, particularly in our commercial collection business as a result of proactive efforts taken to work with our customers as their needs expand to identify service upgrade opportunities. Our event-driven projects in our special waste business and growth in our municipal solid waste business contributed to our landfill volume growth in both 2019 and 2018. Additionally, a large contract executed in the second half of 2017 increased volume at our transfer stations for 2018, with incremental volume additions during 2018 that favorably impacted our volumes in 2019. Furthermore, our WMSBS organization experienced favorable volume growth in both 2019 and 2018. The clean-up efforts of natural disasters throughout the U.S. in the first half of 2019 also contributed to volume growth in 2019. However, volume decline from our recycling brokerage services negatively impacted our volume growth in 2019. Additionally, a volume increase from our recycling brokerage services affected the comparability of volumes for 2018 and 2017.Foreign Currency Translation and Other Fluctuations in foreign currency affect revenues from our Canadian operations. Additionally, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by a revenue decline associated with the adoption of ASU 2014-09.37 Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesOur operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business, including certain rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and (x) other operating costs, which include gains and losses on sale of assets, telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Variations in volumes year-over-year, as discussed above in Operating Revenues, in addition to cost inflation, affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses.The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019​ 2018​ 2017​Labor and related benefits​$ 2,791 18.0% ​$ 2,703 18.1%​$ 2,500 17.2%Transfer and disposal costs​ 1,160​7.5​​ 1,105​7.4​​ 996​6.9​Maintenance and repairs​ 1,355​8.8​​ 1,255​8.4​​ 1,170​8.1​Subcontractor costs​ 1,532​9.9​​ 1,375​9.2​​ 1,236​8.5​Cost of goods sold​ 553​3.6​​ 783​5.3​​ 969​6.7​Fuel​ 336​2.2​​ 409​2.7​​ 375​2.6​Disposal and franchise fees and taxes​ 627​4.1​​ 598​4.0​​ 753​5.2​Landfill operating costs​ 379​2.4​​ 331​2.2​​ 328​2.3​Risk management​ 267​1.7​​ 235​1.6​​ 219​1.5​Other​ 496​3.2​​ 455​3.1​​ 475​3.3​​​$ 9,496​ 61.4% ​$ 9,249​62.0% ​$ 9,021​62.3%​Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include:Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was driven by (i) volume growth in our collection and disposal business; (ii) merit increases and (iii) cost inflation noted above. These cost increases were offset, in part, by lower bonus costs related to a one-time plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by (i) volume growth in our collection line of business; (ii) the one-time bonus plan established in early 2018 and (iii) merit increases.Transfer and Disposal Costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2019 as compared with 2018, and 2018 as compared with 2017, was driven by overall volume growth in our collection and disposal business and, to a lesser extent, cost inflation.Maintenance and Repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was largely driven by (i) cost inflation noted above which primarily impacted labor, parts, third-party services, tires and building costs and (ii) a $16 million non-cash charge to write off certain equipment costs related to our Other segment. 38 Table of ContentsThe increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by (i) higher labor costs from volume growth and cost inflation and (ii) higher third-party service and parts costs.Subcontractor Costs — The increase in subcontractor costs in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by (i) volume growth in our collection and disposal business, largely attributable to a significant contract executed in the second half of 2017 that generated incremental volumes in 2019; (ii) volume growth in our WMSBS and EES organizations and (iii) cost inflation related to capacity constraints of our subcontractors in certain markets. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven primarily by volume growth in our collection and disposal business.Cost of Goods Sold — The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily driven by lower market prices for recycling commodities and by lower costs due to the sale of certain ancillary operations in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily driven by (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) a change in accounting for certain customer rebates due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 in 2018.Fuel — The decrease in fuel costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was due to (i) recognition of a $70 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits in 2019 compared to $28 million in 2018; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and (iii) lower market prices for diesel fuel. The increase in fuel costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was due to higher market prices for diesel fuel, partially offset by the recognition of a $28 million benefit from the extension of federal natural gas fuel credits.Disposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily related to higher volumes in our landfill line of business. The decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2018 as compared with 2017 was driven by the adoption of ASU 2014-09 in 2018; specifically, certain franchise fees were treated as disposal fees and taxes in the prior year periods and beginning in 2018, were treated as a reduction in operating revenues in the current year period.Landfill Operating Costs — The increase in landfill operating costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to higher leachate management costs driven largely by inclement weather in certain parts of North America and increased ongoing site maintenance costs. Additionally, 2019 was impacted by a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets due to a decrease in U.S. treasury rates. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Risk Management — The increase in risk management costs in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation. The increase in risk management costs in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to an increase in claims expense.Other — Net gains on sales of certain assets in 2018 impacted the comparability of the reported periods.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.39 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019​ 2018​ 2017​Labor and related benefits​$ 1,020 6.6%​$ 957 6.4%​$ 1,000 6.9%Professional fees​ 183​ 1.2​​ 113​ 0.8​​ 102​ 0.7​Provision for bad debts​ 38​ 0.3​​ 53​ 0.3​​ 42​ 0.3​Other​ 390​ 2.5​​ 330​ 2.2​​ 324​ 2.2​​​$ 1,631​ 10.6%​$ 1,453​ 9.7%​$ 1,468​ 10.1%​Significant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include:Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to (i) an increase in headcount, merit increases and higher incentive compensation and (ii) increased contract labor costs driven by our planned investments in technology. The decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to (i) lower incentive compensation accruals in 2018 and (ii) severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017, which were partially offset by merit increases and a one-time bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving employee retention. Professional Fees — The increase in professional fees in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by higher consulting fees related to our strategic investments in operating, customer facing and back-office technologies, as well as costs incurred in preparation for our pending acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (“Advanced Disposal”). The increase in professional fees in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the investments we are making in technology and higher legal fees.Provision for Bad Debts — The decrease in provision for bad debts in 2019 compared with 2018 was due to (i) collection of certain fully reserved receivables and (ii) higher prior year bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a strategic customer. The increase in provision of bad debts in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to increased revenues and the bankruptcy of a strategic customer.Other — The increase in other expenses in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by higher litigation reserves and increased infrastructure costs associated with our investments in technology. The increase in other expenses in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher litigation reserves in 2018, which were partially offset by lower costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment as we continued to focus on controlling costs.Depreciation and Amortization ExpensesThe following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019​ 2018​ 2017 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment​$ 893 5.8%​$ 838 5.6%​$ 783 5.4%Amortization of landfill airspace​ 575​ 3.7​​ 538​ 3.6​​ 497​ 3.4​Amortization of intangible assets​ 106​ 0.7​​ 101​ 0.7​​ 96​ 0.7​​​$ 1,574​10.2%​$ 1,477​9.9%​$ 1,376​9.5%​The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during the reported periods was primarily related to higher capital expenditures due to an intentional focus on accelerating certain fleet and landfill spending to support the Company’s strong collection and disposal growth. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during the reported periods was driven by higher volumes at our landfills and changes in landfill estimates.40 Table of Contents(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, NetThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the years ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2019 2018 2017(Gain) loss from divestitures​$ —​$ (96)​$ (38)Asset impairments​ 42​ 38​ 41Other​ —​ —​ (19)​​$ 42​$ (58)​$ (16)​During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized asset impairments of $42 million, related to (i) $27 million of goodwill impairment charges, as discussed further in Note 6, of which $17 million related to our EES organization and $10 million related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (ii) $15 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to certain solid waste operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized net gains of $58 million, primarily related to (i) a $52 million gain associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations in Tier 1 and (ii) net gains of $44 million substantially all from divestitures of certain ancillary operations. These gains were partially offset by (i) a $30 million charge to impair a landfill in Tier 3 based on an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis, taking into account continued volume decreases and revised capping cost estimates and (ii) $8 million of impairment charges primarily related to our LampTracker® reporting unit.During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized net gains of $16 million, primarily related to (i) gains of $31 million from the sale of certain oil and gas producing properties and (ii) a $30 million reduction in post-closing, performance-based contingent consideration obligations associated with an acquired business in our EES organization. These gains were partially offset by (i) $34 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our EES organization; (ii) $11 million of charges to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and (iii) $7 million of charges to write down certain renewable energy assets.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.41 Table of ContentsIncome from OperationsThe following table summarizes income from operations for the years ended December 31 and has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Period-to- ​​​Period-to-​​​​​​​​​Period ​​​Period​​​​​ 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017​Solid Waste: ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​​ Tier 1​$ 1,682​$ 63 3.9 % $ 1,619​$ 113 7.5 % $ 1,506​Tier 2​ 854​ 70 8.9 ​ 784​ 7 0.9 ​ 777​Tier 3​ 1,136​ 144 14.5 ​ 992​ (14) (1.4)​ 1,006​Solid Waste​ 3,672​ 277 8.2 ​ 3,395​ 106 3.2 ​ 3,289​Other (a)​ (203)​ (137) *​ (66)​ 2 (2.9)​ (68)​Corporate and Other (b)​​ (763)​​ (223)​41.3 ​​ (540)​​ 45​(7.7)​​ (585)​Total​$ 2,706​$ (83) (3.0)% $ 2,789​$ 153 5.8 % $ 2,636​Percentage of revenues​​ 17.5%​​ ​​​ 18.7%​​ ​​​ 18.2%* Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison.(a)“Other” includes (i) our WMSBS organization; (ii) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our EES and WM Renewable Energy organizations that are not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) our recycling brokerage services and (iv) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions. In addition, our “Other” segment reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.(b)Corporate operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, information technology, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills. “Corporate and Other” also includes costs associated with our long-term incentive program and any administrative expenses or revisions to our estimated obligations associated with divested operations.Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2019 are summarized below:The following items affected both comparable periods:●Income from operations for our collection and disposal business continued to see strong operating results, primarily driven by (i) internal revenue growth; (ii) acquisitions and divestitures and (iii) decreased fuel costs due in part to a year-over-year increase in federal natural gas fuel credits.However, the following items negatively impacted our results from operations and resulted in lower income from operations in 2019 when compared with 2018:●(i) higher operating costs, driven by increased volumes, higher depreciation related to new collection fleet and higher labor, maintenance and repair costs; (ii) lower recycling commodity prices and (iii) asset impairments. The 2018 period was favorably impacted by net gains associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations in our Tier 1 segment, partially offset by the impairment of a landfill in our Tier 3 segment. In addition, the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017:●Our income from operations for our Solid Waste business benefited from certain federal natural gas fuel credits in the first quarter of 2018 and was negatively impacted by (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) higher operating costs, including a one-time bonus plan established in early 2018 targeted at improving 42 Table of Contentsemployee retention and (iii) increased depreciation and amortization expenses to support growth of our business. During 2018, Tier 1 also benefited from net gains associated with the sale of certain collection and disposal operations and Tier 3 was negatively impacted by an impairment of a landfill.Other — In 2019 compared with 2018, lower income from operations is a result of (i) net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in the prior year period of $44 million; (ii) $27 million of goodwill impairment charges, of which $17 million related to our EES organization and $10 million related to our LampTracker® reporting unit; (iii) lower commodity prices in 2019 associated with our WM Renewable Energy organization; (iv) a $16 million non-cash charge to write off certain equipment costs in 2019 and (v) an increase in claims expense as a result of growth in the business and cost inflation. In 2018 compared with 2017, our Other segment benefited from net gains from divestitures of certain ancillary operations and improved results in our EES and WM Renewable Energy organizations, partially offset by higher risk management costs. Our 2017 results were also favorably affected by a reduction in contingent consideration obligations in our EES organization.Corporate and Other — The most significant items affecting the results of operations for Corporate and Other during the three years ended December 31, 2019 are summarized below:The following items affected 2019 when compared with 2018:●The decrease in income from operations was driven by increased expenses as a result of (i) higher consulting fees, largely due to the investments we are making in operating, customer facing and back-office technologies; (ii) higher litigation reserves; (iii) preparation for our pending acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iv) a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in 2019. Additionally, we recognized higher incentive compensation costs during 2019.In addition, the following items affected 2018 when compared with 2017:●Decreased expenses in 2018 as a result of lower incentive compensation costs and severance costs for former executives incurred in 2017, and to a lesser extent, charges in 2017 to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated potential share of an environmental remediation liability and related costs for a closed site in Harris County, Texas. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher professional fees primarily due to investments in technology.Interest Expense, NetOur interest expense, net was $411 million, $374 million and $363 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 is primarily attributable to our May 2019 issuance of $4.0 billion senior notes, partially offset by related increases in interest income as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents balances. These items are discussed further below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Loss on Early Extinguishment of DebtIn May 2019, WM issued $4.0 billion of senior notes, which are discussed further below in Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations. Concurrently, we used $344 million of the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes to retire $257 million of certain high-coupon senior notes. The cash paid includes the principal amount of the debt retired, $84 million of related premiums, which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, and $3 million of accrued interest. The principal amount of senior notes redeemed within each series was as follows:​●$304 million of WM Holdings 7.10% senior notes due 2026, of which $56 million were tendered; ●$395 million of WM 7.00% senior notes due 2028, of which $64 million were tendered;●$139 million of WM 7.375% senior notes due 2029, of which $58 million were tendered;●$210 million of WM 7.75% senior notes due 2032, of which $57 million were tendered; and●$274 million of WM 6.125% senior notes due 2039, of which $22 million were tendered.​43 Table of ContentsIn the third quarter of 2019, we elected to refund and reissue $99 million of tax-exempt bonds, which resulted in the recognition of a $1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated EntitiesWe recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $55 million, $41 million and $68 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The losses for each period are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments, which are discussed further in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount in 2017 includes impairment charges of $29 million to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their estimated fair values.Other, NetWe recognized other, net expense of $50 million and $8 million in 2019 and 2017, respectively, compared to other, net income of $2 million in 2018. In 2019, we recognized a $52 million impairment charge related to our minority-owned investment in a waste conversion technology business. We wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value as the result of recent third-party investor’s transactions in securities of this business. The fair value of our investment was not readily determinable; thus, we determined the fair value utilizing a combination of quoted price inputs for the equity in our investment (Level 2) and certain management assumptions pertaining to investment value (Level 3). The expense for 2017 was impacted by impairment charges of $11 million related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned investments in waste diversion technology companies. Income Tax ExpenseWe recorded income tax expense of $434 million, $453 million and $242 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 20.6%, 19.0% and 11.0% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following:●Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits – Our low-income housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our income tax expense by $96 million, $57 million and $51 million, primarily due to tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 19 for additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities.●Equity-Based Compensation — During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits related to the vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $25 million, $17 million and $37 million, respectively.●Adjustments to Accruals and Deferred Taxes — Adjustments to our accruals and deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns, analysis of our deferred tax balances and changes in state and foreign laws resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $22 million, $52 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ●Tax Audit Settlements — We file income tax returns in the U.S. and Canada, as well as other state and local jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by various taxing authorities and our audits are in various stages of completion. During the reported periods, we settled various tax audits, which resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $2 million, $40 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.●Enactment of Tax Reform — In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts and subsequent measurement period adjustments related to the remeasurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the one-time, mandatory transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings, resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $12 million and $529 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.44 Table of ContentsSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to income taxes. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and AnalysisWe owned or operated 244 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2019 and 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2018. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended December 31 and remaining airspace, measured in cubic yards of waste, as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019​2018​​Remaining​​​​​Remaining​​​​​​Permitted​ Expansion​Total​Permitted​Expansion​Total​​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​CapacityBalance as of beginning of year (in tons)​ 4,762​ 220​ 4,982​ 4,799​ 186​ 4,985Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 27 — 27 5 — 5Changes in expansions pursued (a) — 36 36 — 72 72Expansion permits granted (b) 57 (57) — 42 (42) —Tons received (121) — (121) (116) — (116)Changes in engineering estimates and other (c) 29 1 30 32 4 36Balance as of end of year (in tons) 4,754 200 4,954 4,762 220 4,982Balance as of end of year (in cubic yards) 4,694 166 4,860 4,735 194 4,929(a)Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any.(b)We received expansion permits at seven of our landfills during 2019 and six of our landfills during 2018, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal airspace of our existing landfills.(c)Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining airspace of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill airspace, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.The tons received at our landfills for the years ended December 31 are shown below (tons in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019​2018​ # of Total Tons per # of Total Tons per​ Sites Tons Day Sites Tons DaySolid waste landfills 244(a) 120,556 443 247 115,972 426Hazardous waste landfills 5 703 3 5 739 3​ 249 121,259 446 252 116,711 429Solid waste landfills closed, divested or contract expired during related year 8 692 1 424 ​ 121,951(b) 117,135(b) (a)In 2019, we acquired five landfills, we closed one landfill and seven landfills under contract either closed or the contract expired.45 Table of Contents(b)These amounts include 1.3 million tons and 1.5 million tons as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects.When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our environmental legacy management group. As of December 31, 2019, our environmental legacy management group managed 212 closed landfills.Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2019 and projected annual disposal volume, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2019, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:​​​​​ # of Landfills​0 to 5 years 27​6 to 10 years 16​11 to 20 years 39​21 to 40 years 65​41+ years 102​Total 249(a)(a)Of the 249 landfills, 207 are owned, 32 are operated under lease agreements and 10 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.As of December 31, 2019, we have 14 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we performed tests of recoverability for five of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $272 million, for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material.Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.46 Table of ContentsThe changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ Accumulated ​​​​Cost Basis of​Landfill Airspace​​​​ Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill AssetsDecember 31, 2018​$ 15,240​$ (9,157)​$ 6,083Capital additions​ 656​ —​ 656Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized​ 72​ —​ 72Acquisitions​ 289​ —​ 289Amortization of landfill airspace​ —​ (575)​ (575)Foreign currency translation​ 52​ (22)​ 30Asset retirements and other adjustments​ (399)​ 428​ 29December 31, 2019​$ 15,910​$ (9,326)​$ 6,584​As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that we will spend approximately $600 million in 2020, and approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.The changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​Environmental​ Landfill RemediationDecember 31, 2018​$ 1,760​$ 237Obligations incurred and capitalized​ 72 —Obligations settled​ (113) (22)Interest accretion​ 98 4Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (a) (b)​ 33 21Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments​ 5 —December 31, 2019​$ 1,855​$ 240(a)The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes revisions in estimates resulting primarily from changes in the timing and amount of costs as well as changes in estimates of remaining airspace.(b)The amount reported for our environmental remediation liabilities includes an increase of $11 million due to a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our liabilities from 2.75% at December 31, 2018 to 1.75% at December 31, 2019.47 Table of ContentsLandfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2019 2018 2017Interest accretion on landfill liabilities​$ 98​$ 95​$ 92Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets​ 13​ (2)​ 3Leachate and methane collection and treatment​ 173​ 150​ 143Landfill remediation costs​ 4​ 13​ 14Other landfill site costs​ 91​ 75​ 76Total landfill operating costs​$ 379​$ 331​$ 328​Amortization of Landfill Airspace — Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses, includes the following:●the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and●the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill (net of accumulated amortization) by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates.The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis for the years ended December 31:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions)​$ 575​$ 538​$ 497Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)​ 121​ 116​ 112Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton​$ 4.75​$ 4.64​$ 4.44​Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 249 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds its working capital needs, the payments of its dividend and investment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings, large value of unencumbered assets 48 Table of Contentsand modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital, operating and other liquidity requirements.Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt ObligationsThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018Cash and cash equivalents​$ 3,561​$ 61Restricted trust and escrow accounts:​ ​ ​Insurance reserves (a)​$ 270​$ 252Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds​​ 109​​ 103Other​ 4​ 11Total restricted trust and escrow accounts​$ 383​$ 366Debt:​ ​ Current portion​$ 218​$ 432Long-term portion​ 13,280​ 9,594Total debt​$ 13,498​$ 10,026(a)Includes $70 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019 primarily include proceeds from the May 2019 issuance of senior notes and our September 2019 issuance of Canadian senior notes. These items are discussed further below and in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2019 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $600 million of 4.75% senior notes that mature in June 2020; (ii) $669 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities, and (iii) $218 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $112 million of tax-exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2019, we have classified $1.3 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long-term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $3.5 billion long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”), as discussed below. The remaining $218 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we also have $169 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, of which $15 million mature within the next 12 months. The interest rates on our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the availability under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified $154 million of these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019.49 Table of ContentsIn May 2019, WM issued $4.0 billion of senior notes consisting of:​●$750 million of 2.95% senior notes due June 15, 2024; ●$750 million of 3.20% senior notes due June 15, 2026;●$1.0 billion of 3.45% senior notes due June 15, 2029;●$500 million of 4.00% senior notes due July 15, 2039; and ●$1.0 billion of 4.15% senior notes due July 15, 2049.​The net proceeds from these debt issuances were $3.97 billion. Concurrently, we used $344 million of the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes to retire $257 million of certain high-coupon senior notes. The cash paid includes the principal amount of the debt retired, $84 million of related premiums and $3 million of accrued interest as discussed above in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay our commercial paper borrowings. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to pay a portion of the consideration related to our pending acquisition of Advanced Disposal, which is discussed in Pending Acquisition below, and for general corporate purposes. The newly-issued senior notes due 2024, 2026, 2029 and 2039 include a special mandatory redemption feature, which provides that if the acquisition of Advanced Disposal is not completed on or prior to July 14, 2020, or if, prior to such date, the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, we will be required to redeem all of such outstanding notes equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest.​In September 2019, Waste Management of Canada Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, issued C$500 million, or $377 million, of 2.6% senior notes due September 23, 2026, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by WM and WM Holdings. The net proceeds from the debt issuance were C$496 million, or $373 million, which we intend to use for general corporate purposes.​See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the debt transactions.​We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018Revolving credit facility (a)​$ 412​$ 587Other letter of credit facilities (b)​ 532​ 556​​$ 944​$ 1,143(a)As of December 31, 2019, we had an unused and available credit capacity of $3.1 billion.(b)As of December 31, 2019, these other letter of credit facilities are both committed and uncommitted with terms extending through April 2021.Refinancing of Revolving Credit FacilityIn November 2019, we entered into the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which amended and restated our prior long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility. Amendments to the credit agreement included (i) increasing total capacity under the facility from $2.75 billion to $3.5 billion; (ii) increasing the accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods from $750 million to $1.0 billion and (iii) extending the term through November 2024. The agreement provides the Company with two one-year extension options. Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., each an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, are borrowers under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and the agreement permits borrowing in Canadian dollars up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $375 million, with such borrowings to be repaid in Canadian dollars. WM Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, guarantees all the obligations under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.50 Table of ContentsSummary of Cash Flow ActivityThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities​$ 3,874​$ 3,570​$ 3,180Net cash used in investing activities​$ (2,376)​$ (2,169)​$ (1,620)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities​$ 1,964​$ (1,508)​$ (1,361)​Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — Our operating cash flows increased by $304 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the prior year period, as a result of (i) higher cash-based earnings in the current year period primarily associated with our collection and disposal business; (ii) lower bonus payments in the current year; (iii) lower income tax payments of $57 million in the current year and (iv) net favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, offset slightly by higher interest payments in the current year period primarily due to our May 2019 issuance of senior notes.Our operating cash flows increased by $390 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with the prior year period, as a result of (i) higher earnings primarily associated with our collection and disposal business and (ii) lower income tax payments of $213 million, driven by enactment of tax reform and timing of income tax payments partially offset by lower earnings from our recycling line of business.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $527 million, $466 million and $200 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $521 million, $460 million and $198 million, respectively, are considered cash used in investing activities. The remaining spend is either cash used in a financing or an operating activity related to the timing of contingent consideration paid. Substantially all of these acquisitions are related to our Solid Waste business. Our acquisition spending in 2019 is primarily attributable to Petro Waste Environmental LP. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings.●Capital Expenditures — We used $1,818 million, $1,694 million and $1,509 million for capital expenditures in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an intentional focus on accelerating certain collection fleet and landfill spending to support the Company’s strong collection and disposal growth.●Proceeds from Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $49 million, $208 million and $99 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, $8 million, $153 million and $62 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets.●Other, Net — Our spending within other, net was $86 million, $223 million, and $12 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash used for other investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to (i) changes in our investments portfolio associated with a wholly-owned insurance captive from restricted cash and cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities and (ii) an initial cash payment for low-income housing investments, which is discussed further in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These items were partially offset by cash proceeds from the redemption of our preferred stock received in conjunction with the 2014 sale of our Puerto Rico operations, which is discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to changes in our investments portfolio associated with our wholly-owned insurance captive from restricted cash and cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.51 Table of ContentsNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Debt Borrowings (Repayments) — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt (excluding our commercial paper program discussed below) for the years ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Borrowings: ​ ​​ ​​ Revolving credit facility (a) $ —​$ 119​$ 302Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility —​ 8​ 9Senior notes​​ 3,971​​ —​​ 745Canadian senior notes​​ 373​​ —​​ —Tax-exempt bonds​​ 339​​ 185​​ 299Other debt —​ 47​ 124​ $ 4,683​$ 359​$ 1,479Repayments: ​ ​ Revolving credit facility (a) $ (11)​$ (108)​$ (728)Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility —​ (117)​ (146)Senior notes​​ (257)​​ —​​ (590)Tax-exempt bonds (204)​ (167)​ (251)Other debt (61)​ (107)​ (192)​ $ (533)​$ (499)​$ (1,907)Net cash borrowings (repayments)​$ 4,150​$ (140)​$ (428)​​​(a)Our revolving credit facility was amended and restated in November 2019.Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments.●Premiums Paid on Early Extinguishment of Debt — During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid premiums of $84 million to retire certain high-coupon senior notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt transaction.●Commercial Paper Program — During 2019, we had net cash repayments of $1,001 million compared to net cash borrowings of $453 million and $513 million (net of the related discounts on issuance) during 2018 and 2017, respectively, under our commercial paper program. We repaid the outstanding balance with proceeds from the May 2019 issuance of senior notes discussed above. Borrowings were primarily to support acquisitions, new business opportunities and for general corporate purposes.●Common Stock Repurchase Program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We repurchased $244 million, $1,008 million (including $4 million paid in January 2019) and $750 million of our common stock during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a result of the pending acquisition of Advanced Disposal discussed in Pending Acquisition below, we limited our 2019 share repurchases to an amount sufficient to offset dilution impacts from our stock-based compensation plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In December 2019, we publicly confirmed that the Company has $1.32 billion remaining on its existing Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations.●Cash Dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors.We paid aggregate cash dividends of $876 million, $802 million and $750 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.425 52 Table of Contentsin 2017 to $0.465 in 2018 and to $0.5125 in 2019 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common stock repurchase program.In December 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.5125 to $0.545 per share for dividends declared in 2020. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.●Proceeds from the Exercise of Common Stock Options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $67 million, $52 million and $95 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the number of stock options exercised and the exercise price of those options.Free Cash FlowWe are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the years ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities ​$ 3,874​$ 3,570​$ 3,180Capital expenditures​ (1,818)​ (1,694)​ (1,509)Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested)​ 49​ 208​ 99Free cash flow​$ 2,105​$ 2,084​$ 1,770​​53 Table of ContentsSummary of Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter TotalRecorded Obligations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Expected environmental liabilities: (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Final capping, closure and post-closure​$ 138​$ 161​$ 114​$ 96​$ 133​$ 2,587​$ 3,229Environmental remediation​ 27​ 33​ 44​ 34​ 22​ 72​ 232Non-cancelable operating lease obligations​ 63​ 58​ 57​ 51​ 40​ 359​ 628​​​ 228​​ 252​​ 215​​ 181​​ 195​​ 3,018​​ 4,089Debt payments (b) (c) (d)​ 823​ 629​ 660​ 646​ 1,220​ 9,701​ 13,679Unrecorded Obligations: (e)​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​Interest on debt (f)​ 472​ 439​ 425​ 399​ 371​ 3,446​ 5,552Estimated unconditional purchase obligations (g)​ 156​ 143​ 65​ 57​ 47​ 379​ 847Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2019​$ 1,679​$ 1,463​$ 1,365​$ 1,283​$ 1,833​$ 16,544​$ 24,167(a)Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills.(b)These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt and financing leases, excluding interest.(c)Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2019 include $669 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months. If the remarketings of our bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(d)Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. These amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods.(e)Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.(f)Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had $122 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations.(g)Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services or contractually stated amounts. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations.54 Table of ContentsPending AcquisitionOn April 14, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire all outstanding shares of Advanced Disposal for $33.15 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of $4.9 billion when including approximately $1.9 billion of Advanced Disposal’s net debt. Advanced Disposal’s solid waste network includes 95 collection operations, 73 transfer stations, 41 owned or operated landfills and 22 owned or operated recycling facilities. On June 28, 2019, Advanced Disposal announced that 85.9% of the outstanding shares of its common stock entitled to vote were voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at a special meeting of stockholders held that day. We anticipate that we will obtain antitrust regulatory approval by the end of March 2020 and close the Advanced Disposal transaction soon thereafter.Critical Accounting Estimates and AssumptionsIn preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.LandfillsAccounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event.Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs.Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill airspace associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related airspace associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill 55 Table of Contentsclosure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:●Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;●We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;●There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and●Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the 56 Table of Contentscorresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.Environmental Remediation LiabilitiesA significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include PRP investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions.Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:●Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;●Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;●The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and●The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentsWe assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. If necessary, impairments are recorded in (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.Property and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. 57 Table of ContentsIf cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs.We first performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicated a possible impairment, we completed a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge was recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods.Insured and Self-Insured ClaimsWe have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities 58 Table of Contentscould be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.We use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. We continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with third-party insurers. In addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a wholly-owned insurance captive, we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of tax deductions related to these claims. WM will pay an annual premium to the insurance captive, typically in the first quarter of the year, for the estimated losses based on the external actuarial analysis. These premiums are held in a restricted escrow account to be used solely for paying insurance claims, resulting in a transfer of risk from WM to the insurance captive and are allocated between current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on timing on the use of funds.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2019, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.InflationWhile inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2019.Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2019, we had $13.6 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $1.0 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of (i) $669 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and (ii) $355 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2020 interest expense by $7 million.Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point 59 Table of Contentsincrease in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019.We are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and equity securities, which generally mature over the next 10 years.Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease.Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations.​60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:32.462845
823768,WM,WASTE MANAGEMENT INC,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion regarding our focus on employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.​We strive to be a workplace of choice through competitive pay, comprehensive benefits for long-term financial and personal health and opportunities for growth across our ranks. Being an employer of choice is critical to our efforts to attract and retain a high-quality workforce, while motivating us to sharpen our focus on our values that help us empower and develop good employees. By promoting from within and offering training opportunities, we help employees maximize their effectiveness and grow in their careers. Safety as a Core ValueAt the Company, safety is a core value, with no compromise. A large number of our employee population work as drivers, heavy equipment operators and sorters, which are essential jobs that carry inherent risks. For nearly 20 years, we have engaged employees on safety through our Mission to Zero (“M2Z”) program. The “Zero” in M2Z represents zero tolerance for unsafe behaviors. Employees learn safety best practices through new-hire and ongoing training. To build upon lessons learned in training, we conduct structured observations of frontline employees that cover all aspects of our collection and post-collection operations, including driving, loading, unloading, lifting and lowering and arriving prepared for work. 8 Table of ContentsLearning and DevelopmentWe offer expansive learning and development solutions to meet the development needs of our people and supporting opportunities for growth and improvement. Our talent management strategy is designed to reach employees at all levels. Given the wide variety of employee roles and skill sets in our Company, our training and development programs are varied but generally fall into the following categories: (i) compliance, including Code of Conduct and cybersecurity training; (ii) safety; (iii) environmental excellence; (iv) professional development and leadership and (v) job-specific.​Inclusion and DiversityFostering mutual trust and respect for one another is a cornerstone of being an inclusive and welcoming workplace, one that is well-positioned to serve our customers and communities. Inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) are part of the Company’s core values; we embrace and cultivate respect, trust, open communication and diversity of thought and people. We are continually working to further embed I&D as central pillars of our culture. To this end, we established two aspirational goals to achieve by 2025: (i) achieve ethnic diversity in each segment of our workforce, with an emphasis on improving representation of minorities in all aspects of our business, including leadership and (ii) lead the industry in female representation at all levels, with a special emphasis on operations and leadership. To enable us to achieve these goals, we have established a cross-functional Inclusion and Diversity Leadership Council aimed at ensuring all of the Company’s policies, practices and procedures support these efforts.Compensation and BenefitsThe objective of our compensation and benefit programs is to attract, engage, reward and incentivize valuable employees who will support the successful execution of our strategy. We pay the full cost to provide employees with short-term disability benefits, long-term disability benefits, basic life insurance for the employee and their dependents, and employee and family assistance benefits. The costs for medical and dental coverage are shared with employees, with the Company paying for a majority of the premium expense. The Company offers other important benefits such as paid vacation and holidays, legal services, flexible spending accounts, dependent care assistance, adoption assistance, employee discounts and student loan refinancing services. We also provide plans to help employees save for their future; refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our employee benefit plans.Financial Assurance and Insurance ObligationsFinancial AssuranceMunicipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting certain variable-rate tax-exempt debt and (iii) estimated final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) a wholly-owned insurance captive, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our behalf. Letters of credit generally are supported by our long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”) and other credit lines established for that purpose.InsuranceWe carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including health and welfare, general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation, real and personal property, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, cyber incident 9 Table of Contentsliability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. We use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. As of December 31, 2020, both our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2020, our automobile liability insurance program included a per-incident deductible of up to $10 million. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2020 are summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.RegulationOur business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the EPA, Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the U.S. and Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in cases of violations.Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state, provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. With acquisition, development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.The regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal, state, provincial and local levels. The policies set forth under the previous U.S. administration, for example, generally were in favor of reducing regulation and corporate taxation. While it is anticipated that the new U.S. administration will reverse course on regulatory policies impacting our Company, we cannot predict what impact the change in administrations will have on specific regulations, nor can we predict the timing of any such changes. Reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, but the extensive environmental regulation applicable to the waste sector is a barrier to rapid entry that benefits our Company. Moreover, the risk reduction provided by stringent regulation is valuable to our customers and the communities we serve.The primary U.S. federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below:●The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Landfills are regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA, which sets forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills, and Subtitle C of RCRA, which establishes a federal program to manage hazardous wastes from cradle to grave. These regulations are typically implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the federal standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.●The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), as amended, which is also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for 10 Table of Contentscleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional release of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, even resulting from lawful, unintentional and attentive action, as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations to a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.●The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If our operations discharge any pollutants into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water run-off that require landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm water discharge permits. Also, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Further, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.●The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, including municipal solid waste (“MSW”) landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In 1996, the EPA issued new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and emission guidelines (“EG”) controlling landfill gases from new and existing MSW landfills larger than specified size thresholds. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for municipal solid waste landfills subject to the NSPS and EG. The EPA issued two new rules that serve to update the 1996 NSPS and EG regulatory requirements in August 2016 and updated its MACT regulations in 2020. These NSPS, EG and MACT regulations impose performance standards to minimize air emissions from regulated MSW landfills, subject those landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on- or off-site. ●The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (“OSHA”), as amended, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.We are also actively monitoring the following recent federal regulatory developments affecting our business:●With regard to regulatory developments under RCRA, the EPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in December 2018 to consider whether to propose revisions to the municipal solid waste landfill criteria to support advances in liquids management. Although the notice does not reopen any existing regulations, we have been working closely with the EPA to ensure that the agency is aware of how future regulation could impact our industry. In July 2019, the EPA announced increases in the user fees accompanying the system that 11 Table of Contentsthe agency uses to track hazardous waste shipments electronically. The U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) has responsibility under the Mercury Export Ban Act to designate a government facility to consolidate the long-term storage and disposal of elemental mercury and establish a fee structure to cover the facility’s operating costs. Our Company continues to store mercury, largely on behalf of our customers, in anticipation of the planned DOE announcements. We cannot predict what cost we will incur in connection with these regulations, but we do not anticipate a material impact to our hazardous waste business units. We are working closely with the EPA and DOE to minimize risks more broadly to our industry.●With regard to regulatory requirements pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions, since 2014, decisions from the U.S Supreme Court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C Circuit, as well as EPA policy memoranda, have significantly narrowed the applicability and scope of EPA permitting requirements for GHGs from stationary sources, including with respect to biogenic carbon dioxide (“CO2”) permitting. In 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) permitting regulations establishing a significant emissions rate (“SER”) threshold, below which sources would not be required to implement additional control technologies for their GHG emissions. This SER threshold should prevent most of our operational changes, such as landfill expansions and beneficial gas recovery projects, from being subject to PSD or Title V permit requirements due to our GHG emissions – assuming the EPA classifies biogenic CO2 emissions from municipal solid waste and landfill gas as carbon neutral. The EPA has not yet finalized this rulemaking, although the EPA’s independent Science Advisory Board has recommended that the agency treat waste-derived CO2 emissions as carbon neutral. These judicial and regulatory actions have reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the potential impact of the GHG-related PSD and Title V regulations on our air permits, compliance and operating requirements. Future GHG regulations may require landfill gas emission quantification and/or emission reduction requirements beyond what is currently required, and such amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.Potential climate change, GHG regulatory, and corporate sustainability initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide low-carbon services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. We continue to anticipate the needs of our customers, which include investing in and developing ever-more-advanced recycling and reuse technologies. As the U.S. and Canada continue to explore various forms of GHG regulation that increase demand for low-carbon service offerings, the services we are developing are becoming increasingly valuable.●We continue to monitor periodic regulatory actions to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) which could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. While we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of potential revisions to NAAQS, we do not believe that the such requirements will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.●In December 2014, the EPA issued a final rule regulating the disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion residuals (“CCR”). This codification of the CCR rule provides utilities with a stable regulatory regime and encourages beneficial use of CCR in encapsulated uses (e.g., used in cement or wallboard), and use according to established industry standards (e.g., application of sludge for agricultural enrichment). The EPA also deemed disposal and beneficial use of CCR at permitted municipal solid waste landfills exempt from the new regulations because the RCRA Subtitle D standards applicable at municipal solid waste landfills provide at least equivalent protection. These standards are consistent with our approach to handling CCR at our sites currently, and the new standards have provided a growth opportunity for the Company. In 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C Circuit vacated significant portions of the 2014 final rule and remanded the rule to the EPA for further revision. As of December 2020, the EPA had finalized two rules and is in the process of developing three other rules aimed at providing utilities with some flexibility in closing or retrofitting unlined storage ponds and in regulating onsite storage of CCR for beneficial reuse. The Company will monitor whether the new administration intends to revisit these rules as we continue to evaluate opportunities to provide CCR disposal services.●In May 2016, the EPA established lifetime health advisories for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), a group of man-made chemicals that have been manufactured and used globally since the 1940s in products such as textiles, fire suppressants, cookware, packaging and plastics. PFAS are typically very persistent in the environment and can be found in water, soil and air. Citing concerns about potential adverse human health 12 Table of Contentseffects from exposure to PFAS, the EPA announced its “PFAS Action Plan” in February 2019 and has taken various actions to address PFAS contamination. Meanwhile, an increasing number of states have enacted new drinking water, surface water and/or groundwater limits for various PFAS, which has led to a patchwork of PFAS standards across the U.S. The EPA is expected to increase its regulatory oversight of PFAS in 2021, with proposals anticipated that would establish drinking water standards, expand authority for PFAS remediation, impose chemical release reporting obligations, and provide guidance on PFAS disposal. Compliance with new and proposed PFAS standards is anticipated to result in additional expense to the Company, but such standards are also anticipated to present potential business opportunities in the area of PFAS management, treatment and disposal.●In August 2016, the EPA published two rules to update the 1996 standards with new requirements for landfill gas control and monitoring at both new municipal solid waste landfills (constructed or modified after July 17, 2014) as well as existing landfills (operating after November 8, 1987, and not modified after July 17, 2014). Working with our trade associations and other landfill owners and operators, we identified significant legal, technical and implementation concerns with the rules and together filed a judicial appeal of the rules while also filing administrative petitions asking that the EPA stay the rules and initiate a rulemaking process. We also alerted the EPA that its August 2016 rulemakings led to an inconsistent regulatory structure in which six separate overlapping and inconsistent sets of work practices now govern the disposal industry. In May 2017, the EPA granted our industry’s administrative petitions for reconsideration and rulemaking, signaling its intent to reconsider its 2016 rulemakings. In March 2020, the EPA updated its regulations to its 2003 MACT standards, adding further confusion to this regulatory scheme, while declining to address many of the ongoing issues that our industry has identified as problematic. Meanwhile, the agency continues to move forward with an additional rulemaking package (a federal plan to implement the 2016 rule for existing landfills) that could also lead to further regulatory confusion. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these ongoing rulemaking processes; however, we do not believe any such regulatory changes will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.State, Provincial and Local RegulationsThere are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements.Our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Many state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste and electronics at landfills. The number of state and local governments with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging.Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The U.S. Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.13 Table of ContentsAdditionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in the U.S. and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities, such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, federal, state, provincial and local governments could take, and in some cases have taken, steps to implement EPR regulations for packaging, including traditional recyclables such as cardboard, bottles and cans. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing.Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While fitness laws can present potential increased costs and barriers to entry into market areas, these laws have not, and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.States and municipalities are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions. These policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities. Our Company supports policies seeking to advance high standards of environmental performance and the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes. Nevertheless, we are actively monitoring recent regulatory developments in this area as additional conditions imposed on permitting decisions could increase the time and cost involved to pursue and maintain necessary permits.Recycling; Foreign Import and Export Regulations and Material RestrictionsEnforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2017, the Chinese government announced bans on certain scrap materials and begun to enforce extremely restrictive quality and other requirements, which significantly reduced China’s import of recyclables. As of January 1, 2021, China ceased importing virtually all recyclables, including those exported by us. Many other markets, both domestic and foreign, have also tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables. As an example, on January 1, 2021, new restrictions on the trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The U.S. is not a party to the Basel Convention, but most countries to which we export are, which may limit exports of certain plastics. The impact of Basel Convention restrictions is unknown at this time, but it will be mitigated by the fact that we no longer export residential recyclables.Such trade restrictions have disrupted the global trade of recyclables, particularly fiber, creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices. The heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs. In particular, single-stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards. As recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased, recyclers are passing cost increases through to customers. The resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the U.S. has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service. COVID-19 placed additional financial stress on municipalities, resulting in recycling programs being paused or eliminated. When combined with the impacts of the global markets shifts caused by China’s termination of imports, the most recent financial stress has led to a number of states considering EPR regulations, which would shift the financial burden of recycling to the producers of products and goods. Industry trade organizations and government agencies are engaged in discussions to mitigate long-term impacts to recycling programs and the industry as a whole.14 Table of ContentsFor the past several years, we have been working with stakeholders to educate the public on the need to recycle properly. We are investing time and labor and working with customers to help improve quality and have seen improvement in the quality of material that we receive at our facilities. We have continued our focus on developing a sustainable recycling business model that meets customers’ environmental needs by passing through the increasing cost of processing and higher contamination rates, and these efforts had a positive impact on the operating results for our recycling business in 2020.With a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment, an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use. The most common materials banned include plastic straws, polystyrene plastic and single use packaging. These bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials. However, with no viable end markets for recycling these materials, we and other recyclers are working to educate and remind customers of the need for end market demand and economic viability to support sustainable recycling programs. With increased focus on responsible management of plastics, our procurement team has taken a proactive approach to ensure environmental sustainability goals are prioritized in managing the products we buy.Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration, Production and DisposalOur EES business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and these disposal services include use of underground injection wells. There is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas, as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. There also remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production, including GHG emissions or hydraulic fracturing, could make it more difficult or cost-prohibitive for our EES customers to continue operations, adversely affecting our business.Additionally, any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations, including through use of injection wells, could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Conversely, any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely affect our business, as we believe the size, capital structure, regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our Company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services.Investment in Natural Gas Vehicles and InfrastructureWe operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. Natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the U.S. and Canada; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business.There is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavy-duty truck industry, and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology, such as electric powered vehicles, rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles. This is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks. Although current options for heavy-duty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations, we proactively engage in pilots of electric powered heavy duty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable. Should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles, our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service 15 Table of Contentsour customers could increase, capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industry-leading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired.Renewable Fuel ProductionWe have invested, and continue to invest, in facilities to capture and treat renewable natural gas (“RNG”) from the Company’s landfills, and RNG from landfill and dairy biogas is a significant source of fuel for our natural gas collection vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 authorize the Renewable Fuels Standards (“RFS”) program that promotes the production and use of renewable transportation fuels. The Company is an EPA-registered producer of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied RNG from landfill biogas, which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the RFS program. Oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, referred to as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), from renewable fuel producers. Market uncertainty related to the EPA’s implementation of the RFS program led to volatility and a decline in the price of RINs between 2017 and 2020. RIN prices rebounded in 2020 in response to a court ruling limiting the number of small refinery exemptions that the EPA could grant to renewable fuel obligations, and later following the November 2020 federal elections on the belief that the newly elected presidential administration would result in stronger enforcement of mandates for RNG and other advanced and conventional biofuels.Federal, State and Local Climate Change Initiatives; SustainabilityIn light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity. We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events.​Consistent with our Company’s long-standing commitment to corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship, we have published our 2020 Sustainability Report, which details the GHG emissions reductions we have facilitated to date and our determination to expand these reductions in the future, as well as our commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe, resilient and sustainable. Our 2020 Sustainability Report can be found at https://sustainability.wm.com, but it does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company actively participates in a number of sustainability reporting programs and frameworks, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, where we are “Sector Leader” for Commercial Services, the CDP, where we are among “A List” companies, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, on which we serve as a member of the Board’s advisory group. ​16 Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors.In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements regarding:●future results of operations, including revenues, earnings or cash flows;●plans and objectives for the future;●projections, estimates or assumptions relating to our operational or financial performance; or●our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance.You should view these statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2021 and beyond and could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the Company. In addition to the following risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known or are not currently believed to be material.Strategy and Operational RisksIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 1. Business for more information on our business strategy.There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:●Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy.●We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.●A key element of our strategy is yield management through focus on price leadership, which has presented challenges to keep existing business and win new business at reasonable returns. We have also continued our environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee to offset costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases and our unwillingness to pursue lower margin volumes may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations. Additionally, we have in the past and may in the future face purported class action lawsuits related to our customer service agreements, prices and fees.●We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.●We may not be able to maintain cost savings achieved through optimization efforts.●Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets.17 Table of Contents●Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, obtain regulatory approvals and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions.●Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others.●Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.●Liabilities associated with acquisitions, including ones that may exist only because of past operations of an acquired business, may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than anticipated.●Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans.●We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses.In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by other factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, subcontractor costs and availability and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.We may not realize the strategic benefits and cost synergies that are anticipated from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (“Advanced Disposal”), and we may encounter difficulties integrating Advanced Disposal’s operations and systems that could impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.The benefits that are expected to result from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate Advanced Disposal’s operations and systems and realize anticipated cost synergies. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition of this size. The process of integrating operations could cause business interruption and distraction. Some members of our management may be required to devote considerable time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our Company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The acquisition of Advanced Disposal may not result in realization of the benefits and cost synergies that we currently expect, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits and cost synergies will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all. Additionally, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the ongoing integration of Advanced Disposal, which may exceed expectations and offset certain benefits.As described further in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, in accordance with SEC staff guidance, we have excluded Advanced Disposal from the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; however, this exclusion may not extend beyond one year from the October 30, 2020 closing date. We are in the process of integrating Advanced Disposal’s operations and systems to ensure the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for this acquired business. Establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff, and the time and expenditures needed may exceed our expectations. If we encounter difficulties integrating Advanced Disposal operations and systems into our system of internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to correct any issues encountered in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data may be adversely affected, which may impact the accuracy, 18 Table of Contentsquality and completeness of our financial statements. Such failure could materially and adversely impact our business and subject us to potential investigations, liability, and penalties. Additionally, if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence and suffer an adverse effect on our stock price.Our operations must comply with extensive existing regulations, and changes in regulations and/or enforcement of regulations can restrict or alter our operations, increase our operating costs, increase our tax rate, or require us to make additional capital expenditures.Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial and local level in the U.S. and Canada have a substantial impact on our operations, and compliance with such regulations is costly. Many complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions restrict our operations at times and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:●limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities;●limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes;●limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste;●mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or●limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams.Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills require us, at times, to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. We have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills and we establish accruals for these estimated costs. Expenditures could be accelerated or materially exceed our accruals due to the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of, including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or third-party landfill operators; environmental regulatory changes; new information about waste types previously collected, such as PFAS or other emerging contaminates, and other reasons.Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The U.S. Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in the U.S. and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to undertake additional responsibilities, such as taking over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, federal, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations for packaging, including traditional recyclables such as cardboard, bottles and cans. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.19 Table of ContentsThe regulatory environment in which we operate is influenced by changes in leadership at the federal, state, provincial and local levels. The policies set forth under the previous U.S. administration, for example, included substantial changes to foreign trade policy and generally were in favor of reducing regulation and corporate taxation. While it is anticipated that the new administration will reverse course on various regulatory policies impacting our Company, we cannot predict what impact the change in administrations will have on specific regulations, nor can we predict the timing of any such changes. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others.Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, transfer stations, MRFs and other disposal facilities, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that are sometimes triggered by weather or natural disasters. There are also risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. We also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction.While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense.We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs.Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subjected, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. States and municipalities are also increasingly adopting requirements for environmental justice reviews as part of certain permitting decisions. These policies generally require permitting agencies to give heightened attention to the potential for projects to disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities. Responding to permit challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If we are unable to attract, hire or retain key team members and a high-quality workforce, or if our succession planning does not develop an adequate pipeline of future leaders, it could disrupt our business, jeopardize our strategic priorities and result in increased costs, negatively impacting our results of operations.Our operations require us to attract, hire, develop and retain a high-quality workforce to provide a superior customer experience. This includes key individuals in leadership and specialty roles, as well as a very large number of drivers, 20 Table of Contentstechnicians and other front-line and back-office team members necessary to provide our environmental services. We experience significant competition to hire and retain individuals for certain front-line positions, such as commercial truck drivers, from within and outside our industry. Additionally, the market for employees that serve on our digital team is highly competitive. As we have accelerated our investments in our digital platform, it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain employees with the skills and expertise necessary to implement and manage our technology-led strategy. We also compete to attract skilled business leaders, and our own key team members are sought after by our competitors and other companies. We make significant investments, and engage in extensive internal succession planning, to provide us with a robust pipeline of future leaders. If we are not able to attract, hire, develop and retain a high-quality workforce with the necessary skills and expertise, as well as key leaders, or if we experience significant employee turnover, it can result in business and strategic disruption, increased costs, and loss of institutional knowledge, which could negatively impact our results of operations.Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand.We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.We have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices, and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments.We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. However, natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in the U.S. and Canada; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. It will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses; a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program.There is increasing pressure to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the heavy-duty truck industry, and some cities and states are beginning to discuss requirements for using more advanced engine technology, such as electric powered vehicles, rather than natural gas or diesel vehicles. This is resulting in a reduction in tax incentives and grants for natural gas trucks. Although current options for heavy-duty electric vehicles lack sufficient range and proven experience for our operations, we proactively engage in pilots of electric powered heavy duty vehicles and anticipate that we could redirect future planned capital investments in our fleet toward these assets when the vehicles prove economically and operationally viable. Should regulation mandate an accelerated transition to electric powered vehicles, our cost to acquire vehicles needed to service our customers could increase, capital investment required to establish sufficient charging infrastructure could be significant and investments we have made in an industry-leading natural gas fleet and infrastructure could be impaired.Increases in our labor costs as a result of labor unions organizing, changes in regulations related to labor unions or increases in employee minimum wages, could adversely affect our future results.Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining 21 Table of Contentsagreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, would enhance organized labor’s leverage to obtain higher than expected wage and benefits costs and resist the introduction of new technology and other initiatives, which can result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Additionally, a large portion of our workforce are hourly personnel, and many of these individuals, particularly in our recycling business, are paid at rates related to federal and state minimum wages. Increases in minimum wage rates, or the enactment of new wage-related legislation, may significantly increase our labor costs. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results.Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the Areas affected. On the other hand, certain destructive weather and climate conditions, such as wildfires in the Western U.S. and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S. during the second half of the year, can increase our revenues in the Areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events. While weather-related and other event driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, due to significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year, and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results.External Economic and Industry RisksThe COVID-19 global pandemic has caused a significant disruption in social and commercial activity throughout North America, and the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar pandemic conditions, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.During 2020 and continuing into 2021, federal, state and local governments throughout North America have imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic and related measures have had a significant adverse impact on many sectors of the economy, including environmental services. The resulting business closures, increases in unemployment and loss of consumer financial stability and confidence has resulted in volume declines and reductions in customers’ waste service needs, which has negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows.We have incurred costs related to health, safety and financial security of our workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included transitioning back-office employees to work-from-home and providing financial certainty to employees by guaranteeing all full-time hourly employees compensation for a 40-hour work week regardless of service decreases and reduced work schedules that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. It could be necessary for us to incur additional such costs in the future related to pandemic conditions. If a large portion of our employee base were to become ill, it could impact our ability to provide timely and reliable service. Additionally, the transition of most of our back-office employees to work-from-home increases various operational risks, including potential exposure to cyber incidents, loss of data, fraud, internal control challenges and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing Company systems and information remotely in the course of their ordinary work.22 Table of ContentsA broad-based economic slowdown resulting from prolonged negative effects of COVID-19 could have significant adverse consequences for the financial condition of our customers or suppliers. As a result, customers may seek to reduce service levels or terminate our contracts, or they may be unable to timely pay outstanding receivables owed to us, each of which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, such factors have made it more challenging to implement our pricing strategy and are likely to negatively impact our ability to negotiate, renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins. Volume changes can fluctuate dramatically by line of business and decreases in volumes in higher margin businesses, such as what we have seen with COVID-19, can impact key financial metrics. Additionally, as stay-at-home orders and work from home trends continue, the costs to service our residential customers could continue to negatively impact our margins. To the extent our suppliers experience a deterioration in financial condition or operational capability as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, we may experience material supply chain disruptions and delays, which could also increase our operating costs.We are not able to estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, but we expect that this situation will continue to have an adverse impact on the economy in general and on the Company’s results of operations until a substantial portion of the U.S. population is vaccinated and social distancing restrictions are lifted. Should these or similar pandemic-related conditions persist for a prolonged period, it may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and hinder our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategy.The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. We principally compete with large national waste management companies, counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources. The industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities, companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products, and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs. In recent years, the industry has seen some additional consolidation, though the industry remains intensely competitive. Counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively-bid contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. When this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business.Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices, and commodity prices for recyclable materials are particularly susceptible to volatility based on regulations and tariffs that affect our ability to export products.Enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2017, the Chinese government announced bans on certain scrap materials and begun to enforce extremely restrictive quality and other requirements, which significantly reduced China’s import of recyclables. As of January 1, 2021, China ceased importing virtually all recyclables, including those exported by us. Many other markets, both domestic and foreign, have also tightened their quality expectations and limited or restricted the import of certain recyclables. As an example, on January 1, 2021, new restrictions on the trade of most plastics went into effect as part of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The U.S. is not a party to the Basel Convention, but most countries to which we export are, which may limit exports of certain plastics.Such trade restrictions have disrupted the global trade of recyclables, particularly fiber, creating excess supply and decreasing recyclable commodity prices. We have been actively working to identify alternative markets for recycling commodities, but there may not be demand for all of the material we produce. The heightened quality requirements have been difficult for the industry to achieve and have driven up operating costs. In particular, single-stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased 23 Table of Contentsprocessing and residual disposal costs to achieve quality standards. As recyclable commodity prices have fallen and operating costs have increased, we and other recyclers are passing cost increases through to customers. The resulting price increase for recycling services in communities and at businesses in the U.S. has resulted in some customers reducing or eliminating their recycling service. COVID-19 placed additional financial stress on municipalities, resulting in recycling programs being paused or eliminated. When combined with the impacts of the global markets shifts caused by China’s termination of imports, the most recent financial stress has led to a number of states considering EPR regulations.Reductions in market prices for recycling commodities, and reduction in demand for recycling commodities and recycling services, negatively impacted our operating income and cash flows in 2019. The decline in market prices in 2019 for recycling commodities resulted in a decrease in revenue of $248 million. In 2020, we saw a modest recovery in commodity prices due in part to an increased demand for recycled materials, resulting in increased revenue of $75 million. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Additionally, future regulation, tariffs, international trade policies or initiatives may result in further reduced demand or increased operating costs, which would cause the profitability of our recycling operations to decline.Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in a corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our EES business. Demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices, such as the low prices throughout the last few years. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future.Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline.Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste and electronics at landfills. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of the U.S. and Canada’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide our highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings, growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills providing services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives.With a heightened awareness of the global problems caused by plastic waste in the environment, an increasing number of cities and states across the country have passed ordinances banning certain types of plastics from sale or use. The most common materials banned include plastic straws, polystyrene plastic and single use packaging. These bans have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban the sale of those materials. However, there are currently no viable end markets for recycling these materials, and inclusion of such materials in our recycling stream increases contamination and operating costs and can negatively affect the results of our recycling operations.General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect revenues for environmental services and our income from operations margins.Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in 24 Table of Contentsdecreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which negatively impacts the ability to grow through new business or service upgrades, and may result in customer turnover and reduction in customers’ waste service needs. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may also reduce the number and variety of services requested by customers. Additionally, a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. A decrease in waste volumes generated results in an increase in competitive pricing pressure; such economic conditions may also interfere with our ability to implement our pricing strategy. Many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase more than the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. This is partially due to our relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels and vendor costs, and may not correlate with the Consumer Price Index or the waste industry.Weakness in the economy may expose us to credit risk of governmental entities and municipalities and other major customers, which could negatively impact our financial results.We provide service to a number of governmental entities, municipalities, and large national accounts. During periods of economic weakness, governmental entities and municipalities can suffer significant financial difficulties, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. During these periods, such entities, and our non-governmental customers, could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates.Purchasers of our recycling commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.2 billion of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and $54 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis. If market dynamics resulted in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we would incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.The Company’s effective tax rate and tax liability could materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors.Predominantly all of the Company’s revenues are generated in the U.S., and changes in U.S. tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”), had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax liabilities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible, among other things. The results of the 2020 U.S. federal elections could lead to further changes in tax laws that would negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The new presidential administration has provided information on what tax law changes it is likely to support, including increasing the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate. If ultimately enacted into law, this could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.Significant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses.The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices 25 Table of Contentsincrease, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, lawsuits have challenged our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins.Technology and Information Security RisksDevelopments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability.Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives.If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer.Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect new technologies. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that innovate our operations, improve the customer experience and provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. In 2020, we are continuing our multi-year commitment to strategic investments in technology, including accelerated investments in customer service digitalization. Research, development and implementation of enhanced technology often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or implementation of technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on these investments. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer.We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected.We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected cost savings or other benefits. Additionally, any system failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations.We are in the process of a complex, multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The ERP system implementation requires the integration of the new ERP system with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes and is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management team important to the operation of the business. Such an implementation is a major 26 Table of Contentsundertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the ERP system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations, resulting in negative impacts on our business and operations and subject us to potential liability. Additionally, our implementation of the ERP system involves greater utilization of third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods.A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, vendors and employees and expose us to increased liability.Substantially all aspects of our business operations rely on digital technology. We use computers, mobile devices, social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees and our customers. These uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions, and we must commit substantial resources to continuously monitor and further develop our networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, and address the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events. Our security programs and measures do not prevent all intrusions. Cyber intrusions require a significant amount of time and effort to assess and remedy, and our incident response efforts may not be effective in all cases. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, direct financial loss, negative publicity, brand damage, alleged violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential regulatory enforcement or private litigation liability and competitive disadvantage. While we do maintain insurance for cyber incidents, due to policy terms, limits and exclusions, it may not apply in all cases, and it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities incurred.Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Advanced Disposal, and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Certain new technologies, such as use of autonomous vehicles, remote-controlled equipment and virtual reality, present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business, subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect certain personally identifiable information and other sensitive information as integral parts of our business and in connection with providing services to our customers. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern the collection and use of such information obtained from individuals and businesses. These laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving interpretations. Government officials, regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. We must continually monitor the development and adoption of new and emerging laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) that took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that can expand the scope of our potential liability. We must commit substantial time and resources toward compliance with 27 Table of Contentsthe CCPA and similar laws and regulations. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, including at newly acquired companies, could subject us to regulatory enforcement, private litigation, public criticism, disrupt our operations, cause us to lose customers, result in additional costs and legal liability, damage our reputation, and otherwise harm our business.Legal, Regulatory and Compliance RisksOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities.There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if it is alleged that our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved and for conditions resulting from waste types or compounds previously considered non-hazardous but later determined to present possible threat to public health or the environment. The risks of successor liability and emerging contaminants are of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which governmental entities, private groups or individuals seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage or violation of statutes or desire to revoke or deny permits required for our operations. We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments.Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant.Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas exploration, production and disposal could adversely affect our EES business.Our EES business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for fluids used and wastes generated by customers engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and these disposal services include the use of underground injection wells. Demand for these services is adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to regulation and industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. There is heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation, as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. There also remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing that occurs during drilling to impact drinking water supplies. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production, including GHG emissions or hydraulic fracturing, could make it more difficult or cost-prohibitive for our EES customers to continue operations, adversely affecting our business. Additionally, any new regulations regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations, including through the use of injection wells, could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. Conversely, any loosening of regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed of could adversely impact demand for our EES services.28 Table of ContentsChanges to federal and state renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer.The primary drivers of renewable fuel development at our landfills are federal and state incentive programs, such as the federal RFS program and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. At the federal level, oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, referred to as RINs, from renewable fuel producers. The Company has invested, and continues to invest, in facilities that capture and convert landfill gas into renewable natural gas so that we can participate in the program. The value of the RINs associated with our landfill gas is set through a market established by the program. Each year, the EPA is required to finalize a rule establishing refiners’ obligations to purchase renewable natural gas and other cellulosic biofuels under the RFS program. Market uncertainty stemming from these annual rulemakings, as well as the EPA’s administration of other aspects of the RFS program, led to a rapid decline in RIN values in 2019 and much of 2020 before rebounding in November 2020. We will continue to advocate for the new administration to implement policies that ensure long-term stability for renewable transportation fuels, as changes in the RFS market or the structure of the RFS program can and has reduced the value of renewable natural gas RINs and negatively impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas.The impact of climate change, and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases, could increase our costs to operate.We continue to assess the physical risks to our operations from the effects of climate change. Although we have made investments to mitigate risk associated with severe storm events, damage to our facilities or disruption of service caused by more frequent or more severe storms associated with climate extremes could negatively impact operating results. We have also identified risk to our assets and our employees associated with drought or water scarcity, flooding, extreme heat and rain events, and fire conditions associated with climate change. For example, wildfires influenced by climate change can damage landfill infrastructure such as gas collection systems, flooding in low-lying areas enhanced by sea level rise can result in greater maintenance expenses at our facilities and service disruption, and more frequent or extreme rain events can erode the protective vegetative caps on our landfills and generate increased volumes of leachate to manage. Those areas of the country most prone to these occurrences have protocols in place, or are developing protocols to address these conditions, including employee safety, driver training, and equipment and facility protection protocols. We have incurred and will incur costs to develop and implement these protocols, and these protocols may not be effective in offsetting these risks. Additionally, the actions of others in response to climate change effects, such as the rolling power blackouts implemented in California in 2019 due to wildfire risks, can result in service disruptions and increase our costs to operate.Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, provincial, regional and federal levels to cap and/or curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. We continue to monitor these efforts and the potential impacts to our operations. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, future GHG regulations may require landfill gas emission quantification and/or emission reduction requirements beyond what is currently required, and such amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations.Some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices 29 Table of Contentsor if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.From time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. We are also party to civil litigation. As a large company with operations across the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and employment-related claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to:●alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous materials and odors;●sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements, prices and fees; and●federal and state wage and hour and other laws.The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.Financial RisksOur capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile.If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile and several other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third-party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected.Additionally, we have $3.1 billion of debt as of December 31, 2020 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the impact of our commercial paper borrowings and tax-exempt bonds. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow.We may use our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in November 2024. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. We had $270 million of letters of credit issued and $1.8 billion of outstanding borrowings (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program, both supported by this facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. In the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.30 Table of ContentsWe have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities.The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results.In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets.In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that have in the past and may in the future lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We have in the past and may in the future be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, including potential legislative changes, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period, and our on-going costs of participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans may increase. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans. ​31 Table of ContentsItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.​Item 2. Properties. The leases on the Company’s previous principal executive offices in Houston, Texas for approximately 345,000 square feet expired on December 31, 2020. In 2019, the Company commenced a lease for new principal executive offices in Houston, Texas where we will occupy approximately 297,000 square feet under a lease expiring in 2035. Occupancy of the new facility began in early 2021. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Florida and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all 50 states except Montana, the District of Columbia and throughout Canada.Our principal property and equipment consist of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our operating properties, vehicles and equipment are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional property and equipment for expansion, for the replacement of aging assets and investment in assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. For more information, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included within this report.The following table summarizes our various operations as of December 31:​​​​​​ 2020 2019Landfills owned or operated (a) 268 249Transfer stations 348 302Material recovery facilities 103 103(a)As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our landfills owned or operated consisted of total acreage of 172,217 and 159,080; permitted acreage of 45,642 and 42,992; and expansion acreage of 716 and 795, respectively.

[Reserved]None.Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2021. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.OverviewWe are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services, providing services throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. We own or operate the largest network of landfills throughout the U.S. and Canada. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste efficiently and economically. We also use waste to create energy, recovering the gas produced naturally as waste 34 Table of Contentsdecomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity or natural gas. Additionally, we are a leading recycler in the U.S. and Canada, handling materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Consistent with our Company’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which details our people-first commitment to help make the communities in which we live and work safe, resilient and sustainable. The information in this report can be found at https://sustainability.wm.com but it does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion see section “Regulation – Emerging Trends in Policy and Regulation – Climate and Sustainability” in Item 1.In 2021, our senior management began evaluating, overseeing and managing the financial performance of our Solid Waste operations through two operating segments. Our East Tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the Eastern U.S., the Great Lakes region and substantially all of Canada. Our West Tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the Western U.S., including the upper Midwest region, and British Columbia, Canada. Each of our Solid Waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services, including collection, transfer, recycling, and disposal. The Company finalized the assessment of our segments during the fourth quarter of 2021. The East and West Tiers are presented in this report and constitute our existing Solid Waste business.Our Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fees which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, described under Results of Operations below.Acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (“Advanced Disposal”)On October 30, 2020, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of Advanced Disposal for $30.30 per share in cash, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 14, 2019, as amended on June 24, 2020. Total enterprise value of the acquisition was $4.6 billion when including approximately $1.8 billion of Advanced Disposal’s net debt. This acquisition grew our footprint and allows us to provide differentiated, sustainable waste management and recycling services to approximately three million new commercial, industrial and residential customers primarily located in the Eastern half of the U.S. The acquisition was funded using a $3.0 billion, 364-day, U.S. revolving credit facility (“364-day revolving credit facility”) and our commercial paper program. In November 2020, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility at which time it was terminated. As a result of the acquisition we recorded $4.1 billion of net assets including $2.5 billion of goodwill as of December 31, 2020. Post-closing adjustments to our purchase price allocation were not material. In connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, we and Advanced Disposal entered into an agreement that provided for GFL Environmental to acquire a combination of assets from us and Advanced Disposal to address divestitures required by the U.S. Department of Justice. Immediately following the acquisition, the divestiture transactions were consummated and the Company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of $856 million.See Note 11 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.35 Table of ContentsFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $51 million of integration related costs, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $156 million of acquisition and integration related costs, which were primarily classified as “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The post-closing operating results of Advanced Disposal have been included in our consolidated financial statements, within our existing reportable segments. Post-closing through December 31, 2020, Advanced Disposal recognized $205 million, $142 million and $60 million of revenue, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. During 2021, we made significant progress on our integration of Advanced Disposal. The focus of these efforts has been to ensure that we continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers through the integration of certain customer facing and back office digital platforms. COVID-19 UpdateThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has proactively taken steps to put our employees’ and customers’ needs first and we continue to work with the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure we can provide our essential services safely and efficiently. We continue to operate with a focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees and maintaining business continuity for our customers. These efforts, combined with our disciplined execution in our daily operations, have positioned the Company to prudently manage the challenges presented by COVID-19. The impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy increased rapidly during the second quarter of 2020, affecting our business in most geographies and across a variety of our customer types. Over the last year, our volumes have been recovering from the sharp decline experienced in April 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The pace of recovery in our volumes accelerated in the second quarter of 2021, and continued in the back-half of 2021 with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of recent COVID-19 virus variants as communities and businesses remained open. The portions of our business that had the most pronounced decreases in volume due to the pandemic were our industrial and commercial collection businesses and construction and demolition and special waste volumes at our landfills. As we completed 2021, volumes in each of these lines of business were either on par with pre-pandemic levels or have now surpassed 2019 volumes. We continue to be optimistic about our volume recovery and overall economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery and the potential for future resurgence in transmission of COVID-19 and related business closures due to virus variants or otherwise. Such conditions could adversely impact our volumes and costs in the future.Business EnvironmentThe waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry. However, customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills. We monitor these developments to adapt our service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs. This includes expanding traditional recycling services, increasing organics collection and processing, and expanding our renewable energy projects to meet the evolving needs of our diverse customer base. As the leading waste management environmental services provider in North America, we are taking big, bold steps in an effort to catalyze positive change – change that will impact our Company as well as the communities we serve. Our sustainability agenda includes expanding recycling and focuses on meeting or exceeding specific 2025 and 2038 sustainability goals around people, customers, the environment, and community, which align with eight of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private service providers based on pricing, and to a much lesser extent, the nature of service offerings, particularly in the residential line of business. Our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors, including increases and decreases in consumer spending, business expansions and construction activity. These factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue. Negative economic conditions, including the impact of COVID-19, can and have caused customers to reduce their service needs. Such negative economic conditions, in addition to competitor actions, can and have made it more challenging to implement our pricing strategy and negotiate, renew or expand service contracts with acceptable margins. We also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities. General economic factors 36 Table of Contentsand the market for consumer goods, in addition to regulatory developments, can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell. Significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience changes in revenue due to volume and a heightened pace of inflation. Volume changes can fluctuate dramatically by line of business and volume changes in higher margin businesses, such as what we saw with COVID-19, can impact key financial metrics. We must dynamically manage our cost structure in response to volume changes and cost inflation.We believe the Company’s industry-leading asset network and strategic focus on investing in our people and our digital platform will give the Company the necessary tools to address the evolving challenges impacting the Company and our industry. In line with our commitment to continuous improvement and a differentiated customer experience, we remain focused on our customer service digitalization initiative to change the way we interact with our customers. Enhancements made through this initiative are intended to seamlessly and digitally connect all the Company’s functions required to service our customers in order to provide the best experience and service. Additionally, in early 2022, we substantially implemented our new enterprise resource planning system which will drive operational and service excellence by empowering our people through a modern, simplified and connected employee experience.Certain macroeconomic pressures and market disruption, driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, intensified during the second half of 2021 and are continuing. The constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments, overtime hours and training new hires to address frontline employee turnover, increased volume, and operational challenges servicing customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the constrained labor market have also contributed to significant global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressure for the goods and services we purchase, with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs. Supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet, steel containers and other purchases. Aspects of our business rely on third-party transportation providers, and such services have become more limited and expensive. Additionally, we are currently experiencing margin pressures from commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices. The extent and duration of the impact of these labor market, supply chain and transportation challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; size, location and qualifications of the labor pool; behavioral changes; wage and price structures; adoption of new or revised regulations, including vaccine mandates; and broader macroeconomic conditions. As costs increase, we focus on our strategic pricing efforts, as well as operating efficiencies and cost controls, to maintain and grow our earnings and cash flow. With increased pressure from the strong economic recovery, particularly on labor, we remain focused on putting our people first to ensure that they are well positioned to diligently and safely execute our daily operations. We are encouraged by our results in 2021 and remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service, managing our variable costs with changing volumes and investing in technology that will enhance our customers’ experience and reduce our cost to serve.37 Table of ContentsCurrent Year Financial ResultsDuring 2021, we delivered strong revenue and income from operations as we continued to experience higher yield and volume recovery in our landfill, commercial and industrial collection businesses and benefited from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. However, our income from operations was impacted by constraints on labor availability and inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the second half of 2021. We continue to invest in our people through market wage adjustments, investments in our digital platform and training for new team members. In addition, we are focused on executing on our disciplined pricing programs to drive margin growth in the face of these additional labor cost and inflationary pressures. We also made significant investments in recycling automation technology and customer service digitalization to further support our continued focus on optimizing operational efficiency as well as achieving improved labor productivity for all lines of business. During 2021, the Company allocated $1,904 million of available cash to capital expenditures. We also allocated $2,320 million of available cash to our shareholders during 2021 through dividends and common stock repurchases.Key elements of our 2021 financial results include:●Revenues of $17,931 million for 2021 compared with $15,218 million in 2020, an increase of $2,713 million, or 17.8%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) record-high increases in the market prices for recycling commodities we sell; (iii) higher yield in our collection and disposal lines of business and (iv) strong volume growth;●Operating expenses of $11,111 million in 2021, or 62.0% of revenues, compared with $9,341 million, or 61.4% of revenues, in 2020. The $1,770 million increase is primarily attributable to (i) increased volumes from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices, which also meaningfully impacted our operating expense as a percentage of revenue; (iii) volume recovery from earlier pandemic lows; (iv) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth and (v) inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the second half of 2021;●Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,864 million in 2021, or 10.4% of revenues, compared with $1,728 million, or 11.4% of revenues, in 2020. The $136 million increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) strategic investments in our digital platform and (iii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. These cost increases are partially offset by (i) lower consulting, advisory and legal fees associated with our completion of the Advanced Disposal acquisition in 2020 and (ii) a decrease in our provision for bad debts as collections returned to pre-pandemic levels;●Income from operations of $2,965 million, or 16.5% of revenues, in 2021 compared with $2,434 million, or 16.0% of revenues, in 2020. The improved earnings in the current year are driven by (i) strong operating results in our collection and disposal business; (ii) improved profitability in our recycling business; (iii) lower transaction-related costs following our 2020 acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iv) improved profitability in our WM Renewable Energy business. The increase in income from operations was partially offset by (i) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth; (ii) inflationary cost pressures and (iii) increased depreciation and amortization from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased landfill amortization from higher volumes and revisions in landfill estimates. During 2021, the positive earnings contributions from Advanced Disposal were offset by elevated depreciation and amortization of acquired assets;●Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. was $1,816 million, or $4.29 per diluted share, compared with $1,496 million, or $3.52 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The increase in income from operations discussed above, in addition to lower interest expense, drove an increase in net income which was partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt;●Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,338 million in 2021, compared with $3,403 million in 2020 with the improvement driven by (i) an increase in earnings; (ii) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) lower interest payments; (iv) lower income taxes paid in the current year and (v) favorable changes in our working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures; and38 Table of Contents●Free cash flow was $2,530 million in 2021, compared with $2,656 million in 2020. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily attributable to higher proceeds from divestitures in 2020 primarily related to assets required to be sold by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities discussed above. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. Refer to Free Cash Flow below for our definition of free cash flow, additional information about our use of this measure, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.Results of OperationsOperating RevenuesOur Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) and Energy and Environmental Services (“EES”) businesses, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and certain other expanded service offerings and solutions.

We are driving improvements in our residential line of business, aligning the price charged for services we provide to our customers with the costs to provide the services, resulting in increased average yield in 2021 of 4.5%, up from 2.9% in 2020. We are also continuing to see growth in our landfill and transfer businesses with our municipal solid waste business experiencing 3.2% average yield growth for 2021 compared to 2.3% in 2020. A significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision, which has resulted in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under those contracts during this period of rapid inflation. Separately, for many of our customers we provide services under multi-year contracts that can restrict our ability to increase prices and the timing of such increases. As we enter 2022, many of these contract lookback provisions will begin to capture the recent inflationary cost increases.Recycling — Recycling revenue increased $537 million and $75 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities. Average market prices for recycling commodities at the Company’s facilities were approximately 115% and 19% higher in 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared with the prior year periods. Market prices began to increase in 2020 from the unprecedented lows experienced in 2019, largely due to COVID-19 related decreases in the supply of recycled materials. Demand for recycled materials strengthened in the back-half of 2020 and continued in 2021, outpacing supply, driven by the growth in e-commerce, businesses re-opening, and manufacturers committing to use more recycled content in their packaging. We have also maintained our focus on converting to a fee-based pricing model that ensures fees paid by customers address the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure of managing contamination in the recycling stream.Fuel Surcharges and Other — These fees, which include our fuel surcharge program, yield from our WM Renewable Energy business and other mandated fees, increased $240 million in 2021, as compared with 2020, and decreased $151 million in 2020 as compared with 2019. Fuel surcharge revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel, and also vary with changes in our volume-based revenue activity. Market prices for diesel fuel were almost 30% higher in 2021, when compared with 2020, as diesel fuel prices began to increase towards the end of 2020 and continued to increase throughout 2021. Consistent with the general downturn in oil and gas markets in 2020, market prices for diesel fuel were approximately 16% lower in 2020, as compared to 2019. Additionally, we transitioned certain customers’ pricing away from a fuel surcharge in 2020, reflecting the cost of fuel in the base rates we charge for our services, which further contributed to the decline in 2020 as compared with 2019. Revenue from our WM Renewable Energy business increased in 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily driven by the increase in value for renewable fuel standard credits. The other fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These amounts have not significantly impacted the change in revenue for the periods presented. 41 Table of ContentsVolumeOur revenues from volume (excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures) increased $435 million, or 2.8%, in 2021, as compared with 2020, and decreased $692 million, or 4.5%, in 2020, as compared with 2019. Over the last year, our volumes have been recovering from the sharp decline experienced in April 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The pace of recovery in our volumes accelerated in the second quarter of 2021 and continued in the back-half of 2021 with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of recent COVID-19 virus variants as communities and businesses remained open. The portions of our business that had the most pronounced decreases in volume due to the pandemic were our industrial and commercial collection businesses and our landfill volumes. As we completed 2021, volumes in each of these lines of business were either on par with pre-pandemic levels or have now surpassed 2019 volumes. We continue to be optimistic about volume recovery and overall economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty remains with respect to various factors that influence the pace of economic recovery and the potential for future resurgence in transmission of COVID-19 and related business closures due to virus variants or otherwise. Such conditions could adversely impact our volumes in the future. In addition, our WMSBS business volume grew from our continued focus on a differentiated service model for national accounts customers. Acquisitions and DivestituresAcquisitions and divestitures resulted in a net increase in revenues of $983 million, or 6.5%, and $240 million, or 1.6%, in 2021 and 2020, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business, including certain rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, net of tax credits for alternative fuel, which represent the costs of fuel to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and (x) other operating costs, which include gains and losses on sale of assets, telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Variations in volumes year-over-year, as discussed above in Operating Revenues, in addition to cost inflation, affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses.42 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​ 2020​ 2019​Labor and related benefits​$ 3,223 18.0 % ​$ 2,746 18.1 %​$ 2,791 18.0 %Transfer and disposal costs​ 1,161​6.5 ​​ 1,135​7.5 ​​ 1,160​7.5 ​Maintenance and repairs​ 1,596​8.9 ​​ 1,331​8.7 ​​ 1,355​8.8 ​Subcontractor costs​ 1,766​9.9 ​​ 1,523​10.0 ​​ 1,532​9.9 ​Cost of goods sold​ 936​5.2 ​​ 553​3.6 ​​ 553​3.6 ​Fuel​ 393​2.2 ​​ 265​1.7 ​​ 336​2.2 ​Disposal and franchise fees and taxes​ 698​3.9 ​​ 606​4.0 ​​ 627​4.1 ​Landfill operating costs​ 412​2.3 ​​ 394​2.6 ​​ 379​2.4 ​Risk management​ 344​1.9 ​​ 269​1.8 ​​ 267​1.7 ​Other​ 582​3.2 ​​ 519​3.4 ​​ 496​3.2 ​​​$ 11,111​ 62.0% ​$ 9,341​61.4 % ​$ 9,496​61.4 %​Our operating expenses for 2021 increased, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) increased volumes from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices; (iii) volume recovery from earlier pandemic lows; (iv) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth and (v) inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the second half of 2021. These impacts were partially offset by our continued focus on operating efficiency and efforts to control costs as volumes grow.Our operating expenses for 2020 decreased, as compared with 2019, primarily due to decreases in our landfill and industrial and commercial collection volumes and our proactive steps to manage our variable costs in response to the volume declines resulting from COVID-19 impacts. The revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater impact on our higher margin lines of business and negatively impacted operating costs as a percentage of revenues. In addition, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was impacted by our acquisition of Advanced Disposal as the acquired business’s operating cost structure was higher than ours and we incurred certain one-time, upfront costs.Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) increased labor and related benefits costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) merit and proactive market wage adjustments to hire and retain talent; (iii) volume increases, particularly in our commercial and industrial collection businesses, which when combined with driver shortages and turnover in certain markets, increased overtime and training hours; (iv) higher annual incentive compensation and (v) increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to pre-pandemic levels. The decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was largely driven by decreases in volume in our industrial and commercial collection businesses. Our proactive steps positioned us to optimize our route structure to respond to lower industrial and commercial collection volumes. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to (i) improved efficiency; (ii) lower headcount due to employee attrition coupled with proactive steps to defer hiring due to COVID-19 driven uncertainty and (iii) lower annual incentive compensation. These decreases were offset, in part, by annual merit increases and the addition of employees as a result of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal.Transfer and Disposal Costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by increased volume, which includes the volumes from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and inflationary cost increases from our third-party haulers. The decrease in transfer and disposal costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was largely driven by volume declines in our industrial and commercial collection businesses as a result of COVID-19 offset, in part, by additional disposal costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal.Maintenance and Repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, including intentional investments to bring the acquired fleet to 43 Table of Contentsour standards; (ii) inflationary cost increases for parts, supplies and third-party services; (iii) additional fleet maintenance driven by commercial and industrial collection volume increases; (iv) labor cost pressure from our technicians, including higher overtime from labor shortages; (v) an increase in container repairs driven by volume increases and delays in normal course capital expenditures for steel containers due to both steel costs and supply chain constraints and (vi) increased building maintenance costs including improvements to facilities. The decrease in maintenance and repairs costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was largely driven by proactive steps to optimize routes and reduce overtime hours to address the volume declines discussed above. Additionally, the 2019 period was also impacted by a $16 million non-cash charge to write-off certain equipment costs related to our Other segment. This decline in costs was partially offset by intentional investments in the acquired Advanced Disposal fleet and inflationary cost pressures for both our Company and third-party services due to demand for skilled technician labor as well as for parts and supplies. Subcontractor Costs — The increase in subcontractor costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) inflationary cost increases from third-party haulers and higher volumes; (ii) an increase in volumes in our WMSBS business, which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling than our collection and disposal business and (iii) the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The decrease in subcontractor costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was largely due to COVID-19 driven volume declines in our industrial collection business and projects ending or scaling down during 2020 in our EES business. The decrease was offset, in part, by an increase in business activity in our WMSBS business. Cost of Goods Sold — The increase in cost of goods sold in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by increases in market prices for recycling commodities of approximately 115% and to a lesser extent, higher recycling volumes. Costs in 2020 were flat when compared with 2019 in spite of an increase in commodity prices, largely due to lower recycling volumes as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, a higher percentage of our overall recycled commodity sales in 2020 were targeted at domestic markets, resulting in lower freight costs.Fuel — The increase in fuel costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to (i) increases of almost 30% in market prices for diesel fuel; (ii) the acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iii) volume increases in our commercial and industrial collection businesses. The decrease in fuel costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily due to (i) a decline of approximately 15% in market prices for diesel fuel; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles and (iii) volume declines. The decreases were offset, in part, by (i) lower federal alternative fuel credits and (ii) additional costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Disposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by (i) landfill volume increases; (ii) disposal rate increases at certain landfills and (iii) additional costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The decrease in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily related to lower landfill volumes, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19. The decreases were offset, in part, by additional costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Landfill Operating Costs — The increase in landfill operating costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to volume increases, which includes our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased testing and monitoring costs. These increases were partially offset by (i) lower leachate management costs, primarily due to the cessation of certain transportation costs in our East Tier segment and (ii) changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in 2021 and 2020. Our measurement of these balances includes application of a risk-free discount rate, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2021, there was an increase in the discount rate, which resulted in a reduction in the net liability balance and a credit to expense. Conversely, in 2020, there was a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase in the net liability balance and a charge to expense.The increase in landfill operating costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily due to higher leachate management costs compared to the prior year and additional costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. This increase was offset, in part, by decreases attributable to lower volumes at our landfills. Risk Management — The increase in risk management costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and overall economic recovery, increasing business activity and claim volumes and related costs. Risk management costs were relatively flat in 2020, as compared with 2019.44 Table of ContentsOther — Other operating cost increases in 2021, as compared with 2020, were due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased equipment rental costs attributable, in part, to increased volumes and supply chain constraints slowing normal course fleet and equipment orders. Additionally, during the second half of 2021, additional volumes and inflationary cost pressures drove an increase in various costs. Partially offsetting these was a favorable litigation settlement in 2021. Additionally, net gains on sales of certain assets during each year impacted the comparability of the reported periods.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​ 2020​ 2019​Labor and related benefits​$ 1,215 6.8%​$ 1,057 6.9%​$ 1,020 6.6%Professional fees​ 228​ 1.3​​ 256​ 1.7​​ 183​ 1.2​Provision for bad debts​ 37​ 0.2​​ 54​ 0.4​​ 38​ 0.3​Other​ 384​ 2.1​​ 361​ 2.4​​ 390​ 2.5​​​$ 1,864​ 10.4%​$ 1,728​ 11.4%​$ 1,631​ 10.6%​Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2021, as compared with 2020, increased primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) strategic investments in our digital platform, including planned investments in a new enterprise resource planning system and investments in customer service digitalization and (iii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Partially offsetting these increases are lower consulting, advisory and legal fees from the 2020 acquisition of Advanced Disposal and improvements in our provision for bad debts as collections returned to pre-pandemic levels. Although our costs increased, the significant revenue increase positioned us to reduce our overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues when compared with the prior year periods.​Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020, as compared with 2019, increased due to (i) incremental costs of approximately $150 million incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Advanced Disposal; (ii) strategic investments in our digital platform and (iii) an increase in the provision for bad debts due to negative impacts on customer receipts experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the cost increases, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased in 2020 due to the decline in volume-related revenues. ​Significant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs for 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) additional headcount, including from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) annual merit increases for our employees; (iv) costs associated with our strategic investments in our digital platform and (v) increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activities generally returning to pre-pandemic levels from the lower level experienced during 2020. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2020, as compared with 2019, was largely due to (i) costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, including severance costs and additional headcount; (ii) annual merit increases and (iii) costs associated with 45 Table of Contentsour strategic investments in our digital platform. These cost increases were offset, in part, by (i) lower annual incentive compensation costs and (ii) proactive steps undertaken to defer hiring and reduce labor related costs. Professional Fees — Professional fees decreased for 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in 2020, partially offset by increased strategic investments in our digital platform and integration costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The increases in professional fees in 2020, as compared with 2019, were primarily driven by consulting, advisory and legal fees incurred in connection with our acquisition and integration of Advanced Disposal and strategic investments in our digital platform. Provision for Bad Debts — The decrease in provision for bad debts for 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to an overall improvement in customer account collections and decreased collection risk with certain customers. The increase in the provision for bad debts in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily due to increased collection risk associated with certain customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other — The increase in other expenses for 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by costs associated with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased technology infrastructure costs to support our strategic investments in our digital platform. The decrease in other expenses in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily due to lower litigation costs and proactive measures taken to reduce discretionary costs, such as travel and entertainment, company-wide. These cost decreases were offset, in part, by increased technology infrastructure costs in 2020 to support strategic investments in our digital platform. We also incurred one-time technology costs in 2020 to transition employees to work-from-home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Depreciation and Amortization ExpensesThe following table summarizes the components of our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​ 2020​ 2019 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment​$ 1,125 6.2%​$ 996 6.6%​$ 893 5.8%Amortization of landfill airspace​ 731​ 4.1​​ 568​ 3.7​​ 575​ 3.7​Amortization of intangible assets​ 143​ 0.8​​ 107​ 0.7​​ 106​ 0.7​​​$ 1,999​11.1 %​$ 1,671​11.0 %​$ 1,574​10.2 %​The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2021, as compared with 2020, was related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and investments in capital assets, including our fleet, heavy equipment at our landfills and containers to service our customers. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace in 2021, as compared with 2020, was driven by (i) changes in amortization rates driven by revisions in landfill estimates, which includes changes in the anticipated timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities; (ii) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iii) landfill volume increases from the economic recovery. Additionally, 2020 benefited from a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2020, as compared with 2019, was primarily related to (i) investments in capital assets, including our fleet and facilities and (ii) additional depreciation attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace in 2020, as compared with 2019, was driven by (i) lower volumes at our landfills, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations from 2.5% to 2.25% at December 31, 2020. These decreases were offset, in part, by charges to reflect changes in estimated landfill construction costs and our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. 46 Table of ContentsOur amortization of intangible assets was flat in 2020, as compared with 2019. The increased expense for intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Advanced Disposal was offset, primarily by decreases for certain customer list assets reaching the end of their lives.RestructuringDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $8 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $9 million of restructuring charges primarily related to modifying our field sales and customer services structures to better support our investment in customer service digitalization, which is discussed above.(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, NetThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2021 2020 2019Gain from divestitures, net​$ (44)​$ (33)​$ —Asset impairments​ 8​ 68​ 42Other​ 20​ —​ —​​$ (16)​$ 35​$ 42​During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net gains of $16 million primarily consisting of (i) a $35 million pre-tax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain non-strategic Canadian operations in our East Tier segment and (ii) an $8 million gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our Other segment. These gains were partially offset by (i) a $20 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment and (ii) $8 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to our WM Renewable Energy business within our Other segment.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $35 million of net charges primarily related to (i) a $33 million net gain associated with net asset divestitures executed to address requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, primarily within our West Tier segment; (ii) $41 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility in our West Tier segment; (iii) a $20 million non-cash impairment charge in our East Tier segment due to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace and (iv) $7 million of net charges primarily related to non-cash impairments of certain assets within our WM Renewable Energy business in our Other segment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized asset impairments of $42 million, related to (i) $27 million of goodwill impairment charges within our Other segment, of which $17 million related to our EES business, and $10 million related to our LampTracker® reporting unit and (ii) $15 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to certain solid waste operations in our West Tier segment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. 47 Table of ContentsIncome from OperationsThe following table summarizes income from operations for the year ended December 31 and has been updated to reflect our realigned segments which are discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Period-to- ​​​Period-to-​​​​​​​​​Period ​​​Period​​​​​ 2021 Change 2020(c) Change 2019(c)​Solid Waste: ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​​ East Tier ​$ 2,037​$ 365 21.8 % $ 1,672​$ (175) (9.5)% $ 1,847​West Tier​ 2,103​ 303 16.8 ​ 1,800​ (134) (6.9)​ 1,934​Solid Waste​ 4,140​ 668 19.2 ​ 3,472​ (309) (8.2)​ 3,781​Other (a)​ 34​ 76 *​ (42)​ 116 *​ (158)​Corporate and Other (b)​​ (1,209)​​ (213)​21.4 ​​ (996)​​ (79)​8.6 ​​ (917)​Total​$ 2,965​$ 531 21.8 % $ 2,434​$ (272) (10.1)% $ 2,706​Percentage of revenues​​ 16.5%​​ ​​​ 16.0%​​ ​​​ 17.5%* Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison.(a)“Other” includes (i) elements of our WMSBS business; (ii) elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations managed by our WM Renewable Energy business and not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) elements of our third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our EES business and not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (iv) our recycling brokerage services and (v) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions. In addition, our “Other” segment reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.(b)“Corporate and Other” operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, digital, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills. Income from operations for “Corporate and Other” also includes costs associated with our long-term incentive program.(c)In the fourth quarter of 2021, we discontinued certain allocations from our Corporate and Other segment to our Solid Waste operating segments and Other segment. Reclassifications have been made to our prior period information for comparability purposes.Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2021 are summarized below:●Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased for 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume, as well as the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) improved profitability in our recycling business from higher market prices for recycling commodities and improved costs at facilities where we have made investments in enhanced technology and equipment and (iii) changes from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items discussed above in (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net. These increases were partially offset by (i) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth; (ii) increased landfill amortization from higher volumes and revisions in landfill estimates, including the anticipated timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities at certain landfills and adjustments in 2020 to the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations that benefitted costs in 2020 and (iii) inflationary cost pressures. During 2021, the positive earnings contributions from Advanced Disposal were offset by elevated depreciation and amortization of acquired assets. ●Income from operations for 2020 decreased, as compared with 2019, for the Solid Waste business due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in revenue declines from lower volumes and higher 48 Table of Contentsdepreciation expense which was primarily related to investments in capital assets, including our fleet and facilities. The declines were partially offset by (i) higher yield in our collection and disposal businesses; (ii) the benefit of resumed fees and price increases; (iii) lower operating costs directly related to our proactive steps taken to manage our variable costs in the lower volume environment and (iv) a net divestiture gain of $33 million associated with the sale of net assets to GFL Environmental, primarily within our West Tier segment.Additionally, income from operations for our West Tier segment was impacted by $41 million of non-cash asset impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility. Income from operations for our East Tier segment was impacted by a $20 million non-cash impairment charge related to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace. Furthermore, in 2019, our West Tier segment benefited from the clean-up efforts of natural disasters primarily in California and similar efforts did not recur in 2020.Other — The increase in income from operations for 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by increased market values for renewable energy credits generated by our WM Renewable Energy business.Income from operations for the Other segment for 2020, as compared with 2019, was favorably impacted primarily by (i) volume increases in our WM Renewable Energy business as a result of a new renewable energy facility coming online; (ii) our WMSBS business as a result of newly executed national account contracts and (iii) our recycling brokerage business.Corporate and Other — The most significant items affecting the results of operations for Corporate and Other during the three years ended December 31, 2021 are summarized below:●These costs increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) strategic investments in our digital platform; (iv) increased health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to pre-pandemic levels from the lower levels experienced during 2020 and (v) charges pertaining to reserves for certain loss contingencies during 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in the fourth quarter of 2020 and changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in both 2020 and 2021.●The costs increased in 2020, as compared with 2019, due to (i) higher consulting, advisory and legal fees associated with our acquisition and integration of Advanced Disposal; (ii) strategic investments in our digital platform; (iii) incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and (iv) higher long-term incentive compensation costs. These increased expenses were offset, in part, by (i) lower annual incentive compensation costs and (ii) lower litigation reserves. Interest Expense, NetOur interest expense, net was $365 million, $425 million and $411 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in interest expense, net for 2021 was primarily due to certain refinancing activities, as discussed further below, including (i) the redemption of $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2020 and the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes in November 2020 at lower rates and (ii) the retirement of $1.3 billion of certain high-coupon senior notes and concurrent issuance of $950 million of lower coupon senior notes in May 2021. The decreases were partially offset by decreases in interest income as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents balances in 2021. The increase in interest expense, net for 2020 was primarily attributable to decreases in interest income resulting from lower cash and cash equivalents balances, due to the redemption of $3.0 billion of senior notes with a special mandatory redemption feature (the “SMR Notes”) in July 2020 as discussed below in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net. Partially offsetting the decreases in interest income were favorable impacts due to a lower interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings as a result of the favorable interest rate environment in 2020 compared to 2019. 49 Table of ContentsLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net In May 2021, WMI issued $950 million of senior notes, which are discussed further below in Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations. Concurrently, we used the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes of $942 million and available cash on hand to retire $1.3 billion of certain high-coupon senior notes. The loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2021 includes $220 million of charges related to this tender offer, including cash paid of $211 million related to premiums and other third-party costs, and $9 million primarily related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these transactions.In July 2020, we recognized a $52 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the mandatory redemption of the SMR Notes. The loss includes $30 million of premiums paid and $22 million of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Pursuant to the terms of the SMR Notes, we were required to redeem all of such outstanding notes paying debt holders 101% of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, as a result of the Advanced Disposal acquisition not being completed by July 14, 2020. Accordingly, the redemption was completed on July 20, 2020 using available cash on hand and, to a lesser extent, commercial paper borrowings. The cash paid included the $3.0 billion principal amount of debt redeemed, $30 million of related premiums and $8 million of accrued interest. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we repaid the outstanding borrowings under our 364-day revolving credit facility and contemporaneously terminated the facility, at which time we recognized a $2 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to unamortized debt issuance costs.At the time of acquisition, Advanced Disposal had outstanding $425 million of 5.625% senior notes due November 2024. In November 2020, we redeemed the notes pursuant to an optional redemption feature upon which we recognized a $1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations due to the difference in carrying value and redemption price.​In May 2019, WMI issued $4.0 billion of senior notes, including $3.0 billion of SMR Notes. We used $344 million of the proceeds from this offering to retire $257 million principal amount of certain high-coupon senior notes. The cash paid to retire the high-coupon senior notes also included $84 million of related premiums, which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, and $3 million of accrued interest. In the third quarter of 2019, we elected to refund and reissue $99 million of tax-exempt bonds, which resulted in the recognition of a $1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated EntitiesWe recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $36 million, $68 million and $55 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The losses for each period were primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments, which are discussed further in Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2020, the entity that held and managed our ownership interest in the refined coal facility sold a majority of its assets resulting in a $7 million non-cash impairment charge at that time. Additionally, the 2019 period includes losses associated with our investment in a refined coal facility. Other, NetWe recognized other, net income of $5 million in 2021 and 2020, compared to other, net expense of $50 million in 2019. In 2019, we recognized a $52 million non-cash impairment charge related to our minority-owned investment in a waste conversion technology business. We wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value as the result of recent third-party investor’s transactions in these securities. The fair value of our investment was not readily determinable; thus, we determined the fair value utilizing a combination of quoted price inputs for the equity in our investment (Level 2) and certain management assumptions pertaining to investment value (Level 3). 50 Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseWe recorded income tax expense of $532 million, $397 million and $434 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 22.6%, 20.9% and 20.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following:●Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits — Our low-income housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our income tax expense by $74 million, $87 million and $96 million, primarily due to tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities;●Other Federal Tax Credits — During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility, resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $5 million, $7 million and $11 million, respectively;●Equity-Based Compensation — During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized excess tax benefits related to the vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $18 million, $27 million and $25 million, respectively;●State Net Operating Losses and Credits — During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $15 million, $12 million and $14 million, respectively; ●Tax Audit Settlements — We file income tax returns in the U.S. and Canada, as well as other state and local jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by various taxing authorities and our audits are in various stages of completion. During the reported periods, we settled various tax audits, which resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $13 million, $10 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;●Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes — Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes primarily due to the filing of our income tax returns, analysis of our deferred tax balances and uncertain tax positions, and changes in state and foreign laws resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a reduction in our income tax expense of $3 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively;●Tax Implications of Divestitures – During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain non-strategic Canadian operations. This gain was not taxable, which resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $8 million;●Non-Deductible Transaction Costs — During 2020 and 2019, we recognized the detrimental tax impact of $27 million and $10 million, respectively, of non-deductible transaction costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The tax rules require the capitalization of certain facilitative costs on the acquisition of stock of a company resulting in the applicable costs not being deductible for tax purposes; and●Tax Implications of Impairments — Portions of the impairment charges recognized during 2019 were not deductible for tax purposes resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $15 million. The non-cash impairment charges recognized during 2021 and 2020 were deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our impairment charges.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to income taxes. 51 Table of ContentsLandfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and AnalysisWe owned or operated 255 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2021 and 263 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2020. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the year ended December 31 and remaining airspace, measured in cubic yards of waste, as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021​2020​​Remaining​​​​​Remaining​​​​​​Permitted​ Expansion​Total​Permitted​Expansion​Total​​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​CapacityBalance as of beginning of year (in tons)​ 4,891​ 191​ 5,082​ 4,754​ 200​ 4,954Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures (4) — (4) 259 14 273Changes in expansions pursued (a) — 105 105 — 21 21Expansion permits granted (b) 126 (126) — 44 (44) —Amortizable tons received (124) — (124) (112) — (112)Changes in engineering estimates and other (c) — 4 4 (54) — (54)Balance as of end of year (in tons) 4,889 174 5,063 4,891 191 5,082Balance as of end of year (in cubic yards) 4,808 163 4,971 4,828 163 4,991(a)Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any.(b)We received expansion permits at seven of our landfills during 2021 and four of our landfills during 2020, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal airspace of our existing landfills.(c)Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining airspace of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill airspace, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.The tons received at our landfills for the year ended December 31 are shown below (tons in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021​2020​ # of Total Tons per # of Total Tons per​ Sites Tons Day Sites Tons DaySolid waste landfills (a) 255(b) 124,773 457 263 112,729 413Hazardous waste landfills 5 610 2 5 676 2​ 260 125,383 459 268 113,405 415Solid waste landfills closed, divested or lease or other contractual agreement expired during related year 9 114 5 318 ​ 125,497(c) 113,723(c) (a)As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 14 landfills and 17 landfills, respectively, which were not accepting waste.52 Table of Contents(b)In 2021, we (i) executed one new contractual agreement; (ii) divested one landfill; (iii) divested one service agreement; (iv) closed six landfills and (v) closed one landfill operated under contractual agreement.(c)These amounts include 1.6 million tons and 1.7 million tons as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that were received at our landfills but were not amortized as they were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects.As of December 31, 2021, we owned or controlled the management of 230 sites with remedial activities, are in closure or have received a certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency.Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2021 and projected annual disposal volume, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 38 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 15 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2021, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:​​​​​ # of Landfills​0 to 5 years 28​6 to 10 years 21​11 to 20 years 50​21 to 40 years 61​41+ years 100​Total 260(a)(a)Of the 260 landfills, 219 are owned, 29 are operated under lease agreements and 12 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.53 Table of ContentsThe changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2021 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ Accumulated ​Net Book​​Cost Basis of​Landfill Airspace​​Value of​ Landfill Assets Amortization Landfill AssetsDecember 31, 2020​$ 16,842​$ (9,692)​$ 7,150Capital additions​ 791​ —​ 791Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized​ 117​ —​ 117Amortization of landfill airspace​ —​ (731)​ (731)Foreign currency translation​ 8​ (3)​ 5Asset retirements and other adjustments​ (24)​ 36​ 12December 31, 2021​$ 17,734​$ (10,390)​$ 7,344​As of December 31, 2021, we estimate that we will spend approximately $639 million in 2022, and approximately $1.4 billion in 2023 and 2024 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.As of December 31, 2021, we had 14 landfills which were not accepting waste. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we performed tests of recoverability for five of these landfills with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $297 million, for which the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining nine landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was not material.Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.The changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​Environmental​ Landfill RemediationDecember 31, 2020​$ 2,156​$ 230Obligations incurred and capitalized​ 117 —Obligations settled​ (101) (22)Interest accretion​ 108 3Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (a)​ 33 2Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (b)​ 13 —December 31, 2021​$ 2,326​$ 213(a)The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes an increase of $15 million due to a business decision to accelerate the closure timing of a landfill in our West Tier segment, which resulted in the acceleration of the expected timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities. The remaining increase relates to revisions in estimated costs and timing of capping, closure and post-closure liabilities.(b)The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes an increase of $13 million related to changes in the fair values assigned to certain acquired Advanced Disposal sites.54 Table of ContentsLandfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2021 2020 2019Interest accretion on landfill liabilities​$ 108​$ 103​$ 98Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets​ (2)​ 9​ 13Leachate and methane collection and treatment​ 183​ 189​ 173Landfill remediation costs​ 6​ 1​ 4Other landfill site costs​ 117​ 92​ 91Total landfill operating costs​$ 412​$ 394​$ 379​Amortization of Landfill Airspace — Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation and amortization expenses, includes the following:●the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and●the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill (net of accumulated amortization) by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates.The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis for the year ended December 31:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020 2019Amortization of landfill airspace (in millions)​$ 731​$ 568​$ 575Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)​ 124​ 112​ 121Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton​$ 5.90​$ 5.07​$ 4.75​Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 260 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year. 55 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources The Company consistently generates cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds our working capital needs, payment of our dividends, investment in the business through capital expenditures and tuck-in acquisitions, and funding of strategic growth and sustainability investments. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business requirements that may arise during the year. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings, large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital, operating, strategic and other liquidity requirements. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter TotalRecorded Obligations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities (a)​$ 137​$ 171​$ 165​$ 188​$ 133​$ 2,477​$ 3,271Debt payments (b)​ 2,449​ 651​ 249​ 1,278​ 677​ 8,275​ 13,579Unrecorded Obligations:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​Interest on debt (c)​ 323​ 290​ 278​ 266​ 247​ 2,293​ 3,697Estimated unconditional purchase obligations (d)​ 197​ 182​ 130​ 105​ 95​ 368​ 1,077Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2021​$ 3,106​$ 1,294​$ 822​$ 1,837​$ 1,152​$ 13,413​$ 21,624(a)Includes liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure costs will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills.(b)These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments based on their contractual maturities related to our long-term debt and financing leases, excluding interest. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations.(c)Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had $58 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations.(d)Our unrecorded obligations represent purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations and guarantees. In addition to the above, we also have recorded obligations related to liabilities associated with environmental remediation costs and non-cancelable operating lease obligations, which are discussed further in Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. 56 Table of ContentsSummary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt ObligationsThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020Cash and cash equivalents​$ 118​$ 553Restricted trust and escrow accounts:​ ​ ​Insurance reserves​$ 305​$ 306Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds​​ 118​​ 114Other​ 5​ 2Total restricted trust and escrow accounts (a)​$ 428​$ 422Debt:​ ​ Current portion​$ 708​$ 551Long-term portion​ 12,697​ 13,259Total debt​$ 13,405​$ 13,810(a)As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $80 million and $75 million, respectively, of these account balances was included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Cash and cash equivalents — The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2021 is primarily due to the use of available cash to retire certain high-coupon senior notes in May 2021, which is discussed above in Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net.Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2021 are described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.1 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $1.8 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program (net of related discount on issuance); (ii) $645 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities; (iii) $500 million of 2.90% senior notes that mature in September 2022 and (iv) $170 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $71 million of tax-exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2021, we have classified $2.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $3.5 billion long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”). The remaining $708 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations.As of December 31, 2021, we also had $54 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with long-term scheduled maturities supported by letters of credit under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. The interest rates on our variable rate tax-exempt bonds are reset on a weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the availability under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified the $54 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with maturities of more than one year as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021.57 Table of ContentsIn May 2021, WMI issued $950 million of senior notes consisting of $475 million of 2.00% senior notes due June 1, 2029 and $475 million of 2.95% senior notes due June 15, 2041. The net proceeds from these debt issuances were $942 million, all of which were used along with available cash on hand, to retire $1.3 billion of certain high-coupon senior notes. The cash paid included the principal amount of the debt retired, $211 million of related premiums and other third-party costs, which are classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, and $15 million of accrued interest. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the debt transactions.​We have credit lines in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs.

WMI has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WM Holdings’ senior indebtedness. None of WMI’s other subsidiaries have guaranteed any of WMI’s or WM Holdings’ debt. In lieu of providing separate financial statements for the subsidiary issuer and guarantor (WMI and WM Holdings), we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for WMI and WM Holdings on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions between WMI and WM Holdings and amounts related to investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (in millions):​​​​​​ December 31,2021Balance Sheet Information:​​​Current assets $ 6Noncurrent assets​​ 13Current liabilities​ 590Noncurrent liabilities:​​​Advances due to affiliates​​ 18,033Other noncurrent liabilities​ 10,778​​​​​​ Year Ended​​December 31, 2021Income Statement Information:​​​Revenue $ —Operating income​​ —Net loss​​ 343​​58 Table of ContentsSummary of Cash Flow ActivityThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020 2019Net cash provided by operating activities​$ 4,338​$ 3,403​$ 3,874Net cash used in investing activities​$ (1,894)​$ (4,847)​$ (2,376)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities​$ (2,900)​$ (1,559)​$ 1,964​Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — Our operating cash flows for 2021, as compared with 2020, increased by $935 million primarily as a result of (i) an increase in earnings primarily attributable to our collection, disposal and recycling lines of business; (ii) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) lower interest payments in 2021 primarily due to certain refinancing activities and the retirement of high-coupon debt during 2020 reducing our overall interest rates; (iv) lower income taxes paid in 2021 and (v) favorable changes in our working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures. Our working capital was favorably impacted by process improvements that contributed to a significant improvement in our days-to-collect metrics. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash tax benefits received in 2020 associated with federal alternative fuel tax credits.Our operating cash flows for 2020, as compared with 2019, decreased by $471 million as a result of (i) higher income tax payments related to a taxable gain on the sale of Advanced Disposal assets to GFL Environmental; (ii) increased interest payments and integration related spending due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) payments associated with investments we made in our digital platform and (iv) to a lesser extent, lower earnings on our traditional Solid Waste business primarily caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results were partially offset by cash benefits in 2020 associated with the 2019 federal alternative fuel credits.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $76 million, $4,088 million and $527 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $75 million, $4,085 million and $521 million, respectively, are considered cash used in investing activities. The remaining spend is financing or operating activities related to the timing of contingent consideration paid. Substantially all of these acquisitions are related to our Solid Waste business. Our acquisition spending in 2020 and 2019 is primarily attributable to Advanced Disposal and Petro Waste Environmental LP, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings.●Capital Expenditures — We used $1,904 million, $1,632 million and $1,818 million for capital expenditures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2021 is due in part to intentional steps the Company took to accelerate growth capital spending on recycling and renewable energy projects. Additionally, in 2020 we took proactive steps to reduce the amount of capital spending required due to the decrease in volumes as a result of COVID-19. The Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business and for the replacement of aging assets.●Proceeds from Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested, were $96 million, $885 million and $49 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, our proceeds are primarily the result of the sale of certain non-strategic Canadian operations. In 2020, our proceeds included $856 million related to the sale of assets required to be sold by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The remaining amounts in 2021, 2020 and 2019 generally related to the sale of fixed assets. ●Other, Net — Our spending within other, net was $11 million, $15 million, and $86 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we used $32 million, $14 million and $44 million, respectively, of cash from restricted cash and cash equivalents to invest in available-for-sale securities. Our 2021 cash spend was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of an equity method investment. We also used $20 million in 2019 to make an initial cash payment associated with a low-income housing investment. In 2019, these items 59 Table of Contentswere partially offset by cash proceeds from the redemption of our preferred stock received in conjunction with the 2014 sale of our Puerto Rico operations.Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Debt (Repayments) Borrowings — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020 2019Borrowings: ​ ​​ ​​ Revolving credit facility $ —​$ 50​$ —Commercial paper program (a) ​ 6,831​​ 3,630​​ 8,554364-day revolving credit facility (b) ​ —​​ 3,000​​ —Senior notes​​ 942​​ 2,479​​ 3,971Canadian senior notes​​ —​​ —​​ 373Tax-exempt bonds​​ 175​​ 261​​ 339Other debt —​ —​ —​ $ 7,948​$ 9,420​$ 13,237Repayments: ​ ​ Revolving credit facility $ —​$ (50)​$ (11)Commercial paper program (a) ​ (6,872)​​ (1,822)​​ (9,555)364-day revolving credit facility (b) ​ —​​ (3,000)​​ —Senior notes​​ (1,289)​​ (4,000)​​ (257)Advanced Disposal senior notes (c)​​ —​​ (437)​​ —Tax-exempt bonds (127)​ (212)​ (204)Other debt (116)​ (108)​ (61)​ $ (8,404)​$ (9,629)​$ (10,088)Net cash (repayments) borrowings​$ (456)​$ (209)​$ 3,149(a)Beginning in 2021, we elected to report these cash flows on a gross basis. Reclassifications have been made to our prior period information for comparability purposes. Borrowings incurred in 2020 were used for the redemption of the SMR Notes and to partially fund our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Borrowings incurred in 2021 and 2019 were primarily to support acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.(b)In November 2020, we terminated this facility contemporaneously with repayment of all outstanding borrowings with proceeds from our November 2020 senior notes issuance.(c)At the time of acquisition, Advanced Disposal had certain outstanding senior notes which were redeemed in 2020 pursuant to an optional redemption feature as further discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments.●Premiums and Other Paid on Early Extinguishment of Debt — During 2021, we paid premiums and other third-party costs of $211 million to retire certain high-coupon notes as discussed further in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2020, we paid premiums of $30 million to redeem $3.0 billion of senior notes that contained a special mandatory redemption feature tied to the timing of the Advanced Disposal acquisition closing. During 2019, we paid premiums of $84 million to retire certain high-coupon senior notes. See Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net for further discussion.●Common Stock Repurchase Program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We allocated $1,350 million, $402 million and $244 million of available cash to common stock repurchases during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.60 Table of ContentsWe announced in December 2021 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.5 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations and listed below, as well as market conditions.●Cash Dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $970 million in 2021, or $2.30 per common share, $927 million in 2020, or $2.18 per common share, and $876 million in 2019, or $2.05 per common share.In December 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.575 to $0.65 per share for dividends declared in 2022. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.●Exercise of Common Stock Options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $66 million, $63 million and $67 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Free Cash FlowWe are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the year ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020 2019Net cash provided by operating activities ​$ 4,338​$ 3,403​$ 3,874Capital expenditures​ (1,904)​ (1,632)​ (1,818)Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested​ 96​ 885​ 49Free cash flow​$ 2,530​$ 2,656​$ 2,105​​​Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.61 Table of ContentsLandfillsAccounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities and (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace.Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs.Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events and the capping costs are amortized as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event at a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:●Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;●We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;62 Table of Contents●There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and●Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.Environmental Remediation LiabilitiesA significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include PRP investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely 63 Table of Contentsreview and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions.Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:●Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;●Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;●The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and●The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and LiabilitiesSignificant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance.Property and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.64 Table of ContentsIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill — At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs.We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicates a possible impairment, we complete a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.Acquisitions — In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid for an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. When we are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition, there can be subsequent adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2021, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.InflationAccelerated and pronounced economic pressures, particularly related to inflationary cost pressures on labor and the goods and services we rely upon to deliver service to our customers, had a more significant impact on our cost structure and capital expenditures in 2021. Our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering as much of the inflationary cost increases we experience in our business as possible by increasing our average unit rate. A significant portion of our revenue is tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision, which has resulted in a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under these contracts during this period of rapid inflation. Separately, for many of our customers we provide services under multi-year contracts that can restrict our ability to increase prices and the timing of such increases. As we enter 2022, many of these contract lookback provisions will begin to capture the recent inflationary cost increases in the price escalation calculation. We are taking proactive steps to recover inflationary cost pressures through the price of our service and by managing our costs through efficiency, labor productivity and investments in technology 65 Table of Contentsto automate certain aspects of our business in order to mitigate the inflationary cost pressures we have seen in our business. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2021.Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.5 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $2.5 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of (i) $1.8 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program; (ii) $645 billion of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and (iii) $54 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on a weekly basis. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2022 interest expense by $7 million.Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2021.We are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high-quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which generally mature over the next nine years, as well as equity securities.Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel, electricity and recycled materials, including old corrugated cardboard and plastics. We work to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues, operating costs and margins may also increase or decrease. As discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we saw significant increases in commodity prices and demand for recycled materials in 2021, resulting in increased annual revenue for our recycling business of $537 million. Variability in commodity prices can also impact the margins of our business as certain components of our revenue are structured as a pass through of costs, including recycling brokerage and fuel surcharges.Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses.

[Reserved]None.Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2022. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.OverviewWe are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions, providing services throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. We own or operate the largest network of landfills throughout the U.S. and Canada. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste efficiently and economically. 35 Table of ContentsThrough our subsidiaries, including our Waste Management Renewable Energy (“WM Renewable Energy”) business, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S. and Canada that produce renewable electricity and renewable natural gas, which is a significant source of fuel for our natural gas fleet. Additionally, we are a leading recycler in the U.S. and Canada, handling materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our Solid Waste operations through two operating segments. Our East Tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the Eastern U.S., the Great Lakes region and substantially all of Canada. Our West Tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the Western U.S., including the upper Midwest region, and British Columbia, Canada. Each of our Solid Waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services, including collection, transfer, recycling, and disposal. Our Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or material recovery facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, considering our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our services generally include our environmental, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fees which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, described under Results of Operations below.Business EnvironmentThe waste industry is a comparatively mature and stable industry. However, customers increasingly expect more of their waste materials to be recovered and those waste streams are becoming more complex. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste at landfills. We monitor these developments to adapt our service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we promote our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste in order to meet their needs. This includes expanding traditional recycling services, increasing organics collection and processing, and expanding our renewable energy projects to meet the evolving needs of our diverse customer base. As North America’s leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions, we are taking big, bold steps to catalyze positive change – change that will impact our Company as well as the communities we serve. Consistent with our Company’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, we published our 2022 Sustainability Report providing details on our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) performance and outlining new 2030 goals. The Sustainability Report conveys the strong linkage between the Company’s ESG goals and our growth strategy, inclusive of the planned expansion of the Company’s recycling and renewable energy businesses. The information in this report can be found at https://sustainability.wm.com but it does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For further discussion see Item1. Business – Regulation – Recent Developments and Focus Areas in Policy and Regulation.We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private service providers based on pricing, and to a much lesser extent, the nature of service offerings, particularly in the residential line of business. Our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors, including increases and decreases in consumer spending, business expansions and construction activity. These factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue. Negative economic conditions and other macroeconomic trends can and have caused customers to reduce their service needs. Such negative economic conditions, in addition to competitor actions, can impact our strategy to negotiate, renew, or expand service contracts and grow our business. We also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities. General economic factors and the market for consumer goods, in addition to regulatory developments, can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell. Significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience changes in revenue due to volume and a heightened pace of 36 Table of Contentsinflation. Volume changes can fluctuate significantly by line of business and volume changes in higher margin businesses, such as what we saw with COVID-19, can impact key financial metrics. We must dynamically manage our cost structure in response to volume changes and cost inflation.We believe the Company’s industry-leading asset network and strategic focus on investing in our people and our digital platform will give the Company the necessary tools to address the evolving challenges impacting the Company and our industry. In line with our commitment to continuous improvement and a differentiated customer experience, we remain focused on our automation and optimization investments to enhance our operational efficiency and change the way we interact with our customers. Enhancements made through these initiatives are intended to seamlessly and digitally connect all the Company’s functions required to service our customers in order to provide the best experience and service. In late 2021, we began to execute on the next phase of this technology enablement strategy to automate and optimize certain elements of our service delivery model. This next phase will prioritize reduced labor dependency on certain high-turnover jobs, particularly in customer experience, recycling and residential collection. We continue to make these investments to further digitalize our customer self-service and implement technologies to further enhance the safety, reliability and efficiency of our collection operations. Additionally, in 2022, we implemented a new general ledger accounting system, complementary finance enterprise resource planning system and a human capital management system, which will drive operational and service excellence by empowering our people through a modern, simplified and connected employee experience.Macroeconomic pressures, including inflation and rising interest rates, and market disruption, resulting in labor market, supply chain and transportation constraints are continuing. Significant global supply chain disruption and the heightened pace of inflation have reduced availability and increased costs for the goods and services we purchase, with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs. Supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet, steel containers and other purchases. Aspects of our business rely on third-party transportation providers, and such services have become more limited and expensive. While demand for recyclables generally continues to trend upwards, during the second half of 2022, we saw significant declines in commodity prices for recycled materials, and we expect continued significant headwinds from commodity prices for recycled material into 2023, resulting from the slowdown in the global economy, which reduced retail demand and the corresponding need for cardboard packaging to ship retail goods. We are also currently experiencing margin pressures from other commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from higher fuel prices. The constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments, overtime hours and training new hires. Geopolitical conflict and the resulting international response, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have also exacerbated market disruption, leading to volatility in commodity prices, impacts on the availability and cost of energy, and vendor and supplier disruptions across the global supply chain. The extent and duration of the impact of these labor market, supply chain, transportation and recycling challenges are subject to numerous external factors beyond our control, including broader macroeconomic conditions; recessionary fears and/or an economic recession; size, location, and qualifications of the labor pool; wage and price structures; adoption of new or revised regulations; future resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemic conditions and restrictions; geopolitical conflicts and responses and supply and demand for recycled materials. As we experience inflationary cost pressures, we focus on our strategic pricing efforts, as well as operating efficiencies and cost controls, to maintain and grow our earnings and cash flow. With these macroeconomic pressures, we remain focused on putting our people first to ensure that they are well positioned to execute our daily operations diligently and safely. We are encouraged by our results in 2022 and remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service, managing our variable costs with changing volumes and investing in technology that will enhance our customers’ experience and reduce our cost to serve.Acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (“Advanced Disposal”)On October 30, 2020, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of Advanced Disposal for $30.30 per share in cash, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 14, 2019, as amended on June 24, 2020. Total enterprise value of the acquisition was $4.6 billion when including approximately $1.8 billion of Advanced Disposal’s net debt. This acquisition grew our footprint and allows us to provide differentiated, sustainable waste management and recycling services to approximately three million new commercial, industrial and residential customers primarily located in the Eastern half of the U.S. In connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, we and Advanced Disposal entered into an agreement that provided for GFL Environmental to acquire a combination of assets from us and Advanced Disposal 37 Table of Contentsto address divestitures required by the U.S. Department of Justice. Immediately following the acquisition, the divestiture transactions were consummated and the Company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of $856 million.For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred integration related costs of $10 million and $51 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred acquisition and integration related costs of $156 million, which were primarily classified as “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The post-closing operating results of Advanced Disposal have been included in our consolidated financial statements, within our existing reportable segments. Post-closing through December 31, 2020, Advanced Disposal recognized $205 million, $142 million and $60 million of revenue, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For more information related to our acquisitions, see Notes 11 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Summary of Cash Flow Activity section below.COVID-19 ImpactThe impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy increased rapidly during the second quarter of 2020, affecting our business in most geographies and across a variety of our customer types. Over the past two years, our volumes have recovered, largely exceeding volumes from the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. While we continue to be optimistic about North America’s overall economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant future resurgence in transmission of COVID-19, a significant new virus variant, or other pandemic conditions that result in business closures and social restrictions could adversely impact our volumes and costs in the future. Current Year Financial ResultsDuring 2022, we continued to advance our strategic priorities—enhancing employee engagement, improving our operations through the use of technology and automation, and investing in growth through our recycling and renewable energy businesses. This strategic focus, combined with strong operational execution resulted in increased revenue, income from operations and income from operations margin driven primarily by both yield and volume growth in our collection and disposal business. We were able to achieve these results despite high inflationary cost pressures. We remain diligent in offering a competitively profitable service that meets the needs of our customers and are focused on driving operating efficiencies and reducing discretionary spend. We continue to invest in our people through market wage adjustments, investments in our digital platform and training for our team members. Despite the significant downturn in commodity prices for recyclable materials in the second half of the year, we remain committed to our investment in recycling automation, which reduces costs and increases throughput, positioning us to overcome commodity price headwinds and deliver a differentiated service. We also continue to make investments in automation and optimization to enhance our operational efficiency and improve labor productivity for all lines of business. During 2022, the Company allocated $2,587 million of available cash to capital expenditures. We also allocated $2,577 million of available cash to our shareholders during 2022 through dividends and common stock repurchases.Key elements of our 2022 financial results include:●Revenues of $19,698 million for 2022 compared with $17,931 million in 2021, an increase of $1,767 million, or 9.9%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher yield in our collection and disposal lines of business; (ii) increases from our fuel surcharge program and (iii) higher volume in our collection and disposal lines of business;●Operating expenses of $12,294 million in 2022, or 62.4% of revenues, compared with $11,111 million, or 62.0% of revenues, in 2021. The $1,183 million increase is primarily attributable to (i) inflationary cost pressures, particularly for maintenance and repairs and subcontractor costs; (ii) commodity-driven business impacts from higher fuel prices and recycling and (iii) labor cost increases from frontline employee wage adjustments;●Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,938 million in 2022, or 9.8% of revenues, compared with $1,864 million, or 10.4% of revenues, in 2021. The $74 million increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher costs associated with our strategic investments in our digital platform and sustainability initiatives; (ii) increased labor costs primarily from higher annual incentive compensation costs and merit increases; (iii) increased 38 Table of Contentsbusiness travel and entertainment expense and (iv) an increase in provision for bad debts; partially offset by (i) lower long-term incentive compensation costs; (ii) market adjustments for deferred compensation plans related to investment performance and (iii) lower litigation costs;●Income from operations of $3,365 million, or 17.1% of revenues, in 2022 compared with $2,965 million, or 16.5% of revenues, in 2021. The increase in the current year was primarily driven by revenue growth in our collection and disposal lines of business driven by both yield and volume, partially offset by (i) inflationary cost pressures; (ii) labor cost increases from frontline employee wage adjustments; (iii) non-cash asset impairments; and (iv) reduced profitability in our recycling business;●Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. was $2,238 million, or $5.39 per diluted share, compared with $1,816 million, or $4.29 per diluted share, in 2021. The increase in income from operations, as discussed above, in addition to a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $220 million in 2021 that did not repeat in 2022, drove an increase in net income;●Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,536 million in 2022, compared with $4,338 million in 2021. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by (i) an increase in earnings and (ii) lower interest payments during 2022. These results were partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2022 primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings and a deposit of approximately $103 million that was made to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) related to a disputed tax matter. The Company expects to seek a refund of the entire amount deposited with the IRS and litigate any denial of the claim for refund. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion; and●Free cash flow was $1,976 million in 2022, compared with $2,530 million in 2021. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in capital spending, primarily driven by our intentional investment in sustainability growth projects as well as timing differences in our fixed asset purchases to support our ongoing operations and (ii) higher income tax payments in 2022. This decrease was partially offset by increased earnings in 2022. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. Refer to Free Cash Flow below for our definition of free cash flow, additional information about our use of this measure, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.Results of OperationsOperating RevenuesOur Solid Waste operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling and landfill gas-to-energy operations. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) and Sustainability and Environmental Services (“SES”) businesses, which include landfill gas-to-energy services, environmental solutions services and recycling brokerage services. We also offer 39 Table of Contentscertain other expanded service offerings and solutions. The mix of operating revenues from our major lines of business for the year ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Commercial​​$ 5,450​$ 4,760​$ 4,102Industrial​​ 3,681​ 3,210​ 2,770Residential​​ 3,339​ 3,172​ 2,716Other collection​​ 699​ 533​ 465Total collection​​ 13,169​ 11,675​ 10,053Landfill​​ 4,600​ 4,153​ 3,667Transfer​​ 2,143​ 2,072​ 1,855Recycling​​ 1,701​ 1,681​ 1,127Other (a)​​ 2,405​ 2,112​ 1,776Intercompany (b)​​ (4,320)​ (3,762)​ (3,260)Total​​$ 19,698​$ 17,931​$ 15,218(a)The “Other” line of business includes (i) certain services provided by our WMSBS business; (ii) certain services within our sustainability business including our landfill gas to energy operations managed by our WM Renewable Energy business and (iii) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions and reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.

Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee fluctuations, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers.The details of our revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield for the year ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020​​​​​​​As a % of ​​​As a % of​​​​​​​Related ​​​Related​​ ​Amount Business Amount Business Commercial​​$ 406​9.2 % $ 152​3.9 %Industrial​​ 307​10.2 ​ 126​4.8 ​Residential​​ 185​6.1 ​ 119​4.5 ​Total collection​​ 898​8.2 ​ 397​4.2 ​Landfill​​ 79​3.1 ​ 42​1.8 ​Transfer​​ 48​4.5 ​ 29​2.9 ​Total collection and disposal​​$ 1,025​6.7 % $ 468​3.5 %​Our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering our higher cost to service our customers that we experience in our business by increasing our average unit rate. We experienced strong average yield growth in our collection line of business of 8.2% in 2022, up from 4.2% in 2021, illustrating our focus on our pricing efforts in this inflationary environment. We are driving improvements in our residential line of business, aligning the price charged for services we provide to our customers with the costs to provide the services, resulting in increased average yield in 2022 of 6.1%, up from 4.5% in 2021. We are also continuing to see growth in our disposal business with our municipal solid waste business experiencing average yield of 6.2% in 2022, up from 3.2% in 2021. Recycling — Recycling revenues attributable to yield increased $19 million and $537 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities in 2021 and the first half of 2022, before the significant downturn in the second half of 2022. Demand for recycled materials strengthened through 2021 and into early 2022, primarily driven by the growth in e-commerce, businesses re-opening, and manufacturers committing to use more recycled content in their packaging. In 2022, we experienced all-time high recycling commodity pricing in the first half of the year to be followed by historically low pricing through the second half of the year, resulting from the slowdown in the global economy, which reduced retail demand and the corresponding need for cardboard packaging to ship retail goods. We expect significant commodity price headwinds to continue into 2023. Average market prices for recycling commodities at the Company’s facilities were approximately 10% lower and 115% higher in 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared with the prior year periods. Revenue decline from lower commodity pricing was offset by higher pricing in our recycling brokerage business as well as our continued focus on a fee-based pricing model that ensures fees paid by customers cover the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure of managing contamination in the recycling stream. Fuel Surcharges and Other — These fees, which include (i) our fuel surcharge program, (ii) yield from our WM Renewable Energy business and (iii) other mandated fees, increased $474 million and $240 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Fuel surcharge revenues are based on and fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel, and also vary with changes in our volume-based revenue activity. Market prices for diesel fuel were over 50% and 30% higher in 2022 and 2021, as compared to the prior year periods. Revenue from yield growth in our WM Renewable Energy business increased $48 million and $85 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by increases in the value for electricity and 41 Table of Contentsrenewable natural gas credits. The mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These amounts have not significantly impacted the change in revenue for the periods presented. VolumeOur revenues from volume (excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures) increased $233 million, or 1.3%, and $435 million, or 2.8%, in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods. Our collection and disposal business volumes grew 1.8% and 3.0% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.Our 2022 volume growth has moderated when compared to the accelerated volume recovery from COVID-related impacts experienced in 2021. Special waste volumes at our landfills have been the most significant driver of volume growth, primarily due to an increase in event-driven projects. In addition, our WMSBS business volumes grew as a result of our continued focus on a differentiated service model for national accounts customers. Our volumes have been impacted by our intentional efforts to reduce unprofitable residential and industrial collection volumes.We experienced higher volume growth in 2021 relative to the sharp decline experienced in April 2020 as a result of COVID-related impacts. The pace of recovery in our volumes accelerated in the second quarter of 2021 and continued in the second half of 2021 with minimal impact from periodic resurgences in transmission of COVID-19 virus variants as communities and businesses have remained open. The portions of our business that had the most pronounced decreases in volume due to the pandemic were our industrial and commercial collection businesses and our landfill volumes. Acquisitions and DivestituresAcquisitions and divestitures resulted in a net increase in revenues of $47 million, or 0.3%, and $983 million, or 6.5%, in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, with the increase in 2021 primarily due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling line of business, including certain rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, net of tax credits for alternative fuel, which represent the costs of fuel to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and (x) other operating costs, which include gains and losses on sale of assets, telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Variations in volumes year-over-year, as discussed above in Operating Revenues, in addition to cost inflation, affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses.42 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022​ 2021​ 2020​Labor and related benefits​$ 3,452 17.5 % ​$ 3,223 18.0 %​$ 2,746 18.1 %Transfer and disposal costs​ 1,215​6.2 ​​ 1,161​6.5 ​​ 1,135​7.5 ​Maintenance and repairs​ 1,835​9.3 ​​ 1,596​8.9 ​​ 1,331​8.7 ​Subcontractor costs​ 2,006​10.2 ​​ 1,766​9.9 ​​ 1,523​10.0 ​Cost of goods sold​ 973​4.9 ​​ 936​5.2 ​​ 553​3.6 ​Fuel​ 592​3.0 ​​ 393​2.2 ​​ 265​1.7 ​Disposal and franchise fees and taxes​ 720​3.7 ​​ 698​3.9 ​​ 606​4.0 ​Landfill operating costs​ 421​2.1 ​​ 412​2.3 ​​ 394​2.6 ​Risk management​ 348​1.8 ​​ 344​1.9 ​​ 269​1.8 ​Other​ 732​3.7 ​​ 582​3.2 ​​ 519​3.4 ​​​$ 12,294​ 62.4% ​$ 11,111​62.0 % ​$ 9,341​61.4 %​Our operating expenses in 2022 increased, as compared with 2021, primarily due to (i) inflationary cost pressures, particularly for maintenance and repairs and subcontractor costs; (ii) commodity-driven business impacts from higher fuel prices and recycling and (iii) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments. We also continue to focus on operating efficiency and efforts to control costs.Our operating expenses in 2021 increased, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) increased volumes from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices; (iii) volume recovery from earlier pandemic-driven lows; (iv) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth and (v) inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the second half of 2021. These impacts were partially offset by our continued focus on operating efficiency and efforts to control costs as volumes grow.Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2022, as compared with 2021,was largely driven by (i) proactive market wage adjustments to hire and retain talent; (ii) annual merit and annual incentive compensation cost increases and (iii) increases in health and welfare costs attributable to our intentional investment in delivering a leading benefits program for our employees and increases in medical care activity. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) increased labor and related benefits costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) merit and proactive market wage adjustments to hire and retain talent; (iii) volume increases, particularly in our commercial and industrial collection businesses, which when combined with driver shortages and turnover in certain markets, increased overtime and training hours; (iv) higher annual incentive compensation and (v) increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to pre-pandemic levels.Transfer and Disposal Costs — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2022, as compared with 2021, was largely driven by inflationary cost increases, which includes increased disposal fees at third-party sites and higher fuel from our third-party haulers offset, in part, by decreases in residential collection and transfer volume. The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by increased volume, which includes the volumes from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and inflationary cost increases from our third-party haulers. Maintenance and Repairs — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2022, as compared with 2021,was largely driven by (i) inflationary cost increases for parts, supplies and third-party services; (ii) additional fleet maintenance driven by supply chain constraints, which have delayed deliveries of new trucks; (iii) labor cost increases for our technicians, including higher overtime; (iv) increased building maintenance costs including improvements to facilities and (v) an increase in container repairs driven by delays in delivery of steel containers due to supply chain constraints. The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, including intentional investments to bring the acquired fleet to our standards; (ii) inflationary cost 43 Table of Contentsincreases for parts, supplies and third-party services; (iii) additional fleet maintenance driven by commercial and industrial collection volume increases; (iv) labor cost increases for our technicians, including higher overtime from labor shortages; (v) an increase in container repairs driven by volume increases and delays in normal course capital expenditures for steel containers due to both steel costs and supply chain constraints and (vi) increased building maintenance costs including improvements to facilities.Subcontractor Costs — The increase in subcontractor costs in 2022, as compared with 2021,was largely driven by (i) inflationary cost increases, particularly for fuel and labor costs from third-party haulers and (ii) an increase in volumes in our WMSBS business, which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling than our collection and disposal business. The increase in subcontractor costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was largely driven by (i) inflationary cost increases from third-party haulers and higher volumes; (ii) an increase in volumes in our WMSBS business and (iii) the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.Cost of Goods Sold — The increase in cost of goods sold in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by all-time high recycling commodity pricing in the first half of the year offset, in part, by the historically low pricing through the second half of the year. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by increases in market prices for recycling commodities of approximately 115% and to a lesser extent, higher recycling volumes.Fuel — The increase in fuel costs in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily due to increases in market diesel and natural gas fuel prices as compared to the prior year. The increase in fuel costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to (i) increases in market diesel and natural gas fuel prices; (ii) the acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iii) volume increases in our commercial and industrial collection businesses.Disposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by higher franchise fees, driven by an increase in landfill volumes, paid to certain municipalities where we operate and overall rate increases in our fees and taxes paid on our disposal volumes. The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by (i) landfill volume increases; (ii) disposal rate increases at certain landfills and (iii) additional costs attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal.Landfill Operating Costs — Our landfill operating costs increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to increases in methane and leachate management costs and other site maintenance costs, in part due to inflation. The increase in landfill operating costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to volume increases, including from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased testing and monitoring costs. These increases were partially offset by (i) lower leachate management costs, primarily due to the cessation of certain transportation costs in our East Tier segment and (ii) changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets. The increases in both 2022 and 2021 were offset, in part, by changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in each year. Our measurement of these balances includes application of a risk-free discount rate, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds. The discount rate increased, which resulted in a reduction in the net liability balance and a credit to expense, in both 2021 and 2022 with more significant impact in 2022. Conversely, in 2020, there was a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase in the net liability balance and a charge to expense.Risk Management — Risk management costs increased slightly in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to inflation in premiums. The increase in risk management costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and overall economic recovery from COVID-driven impacts, increasing business activity and claim volumes and related costs.Other — Other operating cost increases in 2022, as compared with 2021, were primarily due to (i) inflationary cost pressures; (ii) higher equipment rental costs attributable, in part, to supply chain constraints slowing normal course fleet and equipment orders; (iii) higher utility costs at our facilities and (iv) an increase in business travel in 2022. Additionally, a favorable litigation settlement in 2021 impacted the comparison. Other operating cost increases in 2021, as compared with 2020, were due to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased equipment rental costs attributable, in part, to increased volumes and supply chain constraints slowing normal course fleet and equipment orders. Additionally, during the second half of 2021, additional volumes and inflationary cost pressures drove an increase in various costs. Partially 44 Table of Contentsoffsetting these was a favorable litigation settlement in 2021. Additionally, net gains on sales of certain assets during each year impacted the comparability of the reported periods Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022​ 2021​ 2020​Labor and related benefits​$ 1,195 6.1%​$ 1,215 6.8%​$ 1,057 6.9%Professional fees​ 268​ 1.4​​ 228​ 1.3​​ 256​ 1.7​Provision for bad debts​ 50​ 0.2​​ 37​ 0.2​​ 54​ 0.4​Other​ 425​ 2.1​​ 384​ 2.1​​ 361​ 2.4​​​$ 1,938​ 9.8%​$ 1,864​ 10.4%​$ 1,728​ 11.4%​Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022, as compared with 2021, increased primarily due to (i) strategic investments in our digital platform, including those that support our ongoing sustainability initiatives; (ii) higher annual incentive compensation costs and merit increases for our employees; (iii) increased business travel and entertainment expense and (iv) an increase in provision for bad debts, partially offset by (i) lower long-term incentive compensation costs; (ii) market adjustments for deferred compensation plans related to investment performance and (iii) lower litigation costs.​Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021, as compared with 2020, increased primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) strategic investments in our digital platform and (iii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Partially offsetting these increases are lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in 2020 and improvements in our provision for bad debts as collections returned to pre-pandemic levels.​Although our costs increased in 2022 and 2021, the significant revenue increases positioned us to reduce our overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues when compared with each of the prior year periods.​Significant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include: Labor and Related Benefits — The decrease in labor and related benefits costs in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily due to (i) lower long-term incentive compensation costs; (ii) reductions in contract labor and (iii) market adjustments for deferred compensation plans related to investment performance, partially offset by higher annual incentive compensation and annual merit increases for our employees. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) additional headcount, including from our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) annual merit increases for our employees; (iv) costs associated with our strategic investments in our digital platform and (v) increases in health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activities generally returning to pre-pandemic levels from the lower level experienced during 2020. Professional Fees — The increase in professional fees in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by strategic investments in our digital platform, including those that support our ongoing sustainability initiatives, partially 45 Table of Contentsoffset by lower acquisition and integration costs. Professional fees decreased in 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in 2020, partially offset by increased strategic investments in our digital platform and integration costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Provision for Bad Debts — The increase in provision for bad debts in 2022, as compared with 2021, is primarily related to (i) increased revenue; (ii) increased collection risk with certain customers and (iii) favorable adjustments to our reserves taken in 2021 as a result of improvement in customer account collections. The decrease in provision for bad debts in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily due to an overall improvement in customer account collections and decreased collection risk with certain customers. Other — The increase in other expenses in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by costs associated with technology infrastructure to support our strategic investments in our digital platform and an increase in business travel and entertainment expense, partially offset by lower litigation costs. The increase in other expenses in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by costs associated with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and increased technology infrastructure costs to support our strategic investments in our digital platform. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ExpensesThe following table summarizes the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022​ 2021​ 2020 Depreciation of tangible property and equipment​$ 1,155 5.9%​$ 1,125 6.2%​$ 996 6.6%Depletion of landfill airspace​ 754​ 3.8​​ 731​ 4.1​​ 568​ 3.7​Amortization of intangible assets​ 129​ 0.6​​ 143​ 0.8​​ 107​ 0.7​​​$ 2,038​10.3 %​$ 1,999​11.1 %​$ 1,671​11.0 %​The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by investments in capital assets, including containers to service our customers and strategic investments in our digital platform. The increase in depletion of landfill airspace in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by changes in depletion rates from revisions in landfill cost estimates and increased volumes at our landfills, partially offset by a prior year charge due to management’s decision to close a landfill in our West Tier segment earlier than expected, resulting in the acceleration of the timing of capping, closure, and post-closure activities. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets in 2022, as compared with 2021, was primarily driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2021, as compared with 2020, was related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and investments in capital assets, including our fleet, heavy equipment at our landfills and containers to service our customers. The increase in depletion of landfill airspace in 2021, as compared with 2020, was driven by (i) changes in depletion rates driven by revisions in landfill estimates, including a $15 million charge due to management’s decision to close a landfill in our West Tier segment earlier than expected; (ii) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and (iii) landfill volume increases associated with the economic recovery from COVID-driven impacts. Additionally, 2020 benefited from a decrease in the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2021, as compared with 2020, was primarily driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.RestructuringDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $8 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $9 million of restructuring 46 Table of Contentscharges primarily related to modifying our field sales and customer services structures to better support our strategic investments in our digital platform.(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, NetThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2022 2021 2020Gain from divestitures, net​$ (5)​$ (44)​$ (33)Asset impairments​ 50​ 8​ 68Other​ 17​ 20​ —​​$ 62​$ (16)​$ 35​For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $62 million of net charges consisting of (i) $50 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to management’s decision to close two landfills within our East Tier segment and (ii) a $17 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment to adjust an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These losses were partially offset by a $5 million gain from the divestiture of a solid waste business in our West Tier segment.For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net gains of $16 million primarily consisting of (i) a $35 million pre-tax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain non-strategic Canadian operations in our East Tier segment and (ii) an $8 million gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our Other segment. These gains were partially offset by (i) a $20 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment and (ii) $8 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to our WM Renewable Energy business within our Other segment.For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $35 million of net charges primarily related to (i) a $33 million net gain associated with net asset divestitures executed to address requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, primarily within our West Tier segment; (ii) $41 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility in our West Tier segment; (iii) a $20 million non-cash impairment charge in our East Tier segment due to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace and (iv) $7 million of net charges primarily related to non-cash impairments of certain assets within our WM Renewable Energy business in our Other segment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. 47 Table of ContentsIncome from OperationsThe following table summarizes income from operations for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Period-to- ​​​Period-to-​​​​​​​​​Period ​​​Period​​​​​ 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020​Solid Waste: ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​​ East Tier ​$ 2,249​$ 212 10.4 % $ 2,037​$ 365 21.8 % $ 1,672​West Tier​ 2,346​ 243 11.6 ​ 2,103​ 303 16.8 ​ 1,800​Solid Waste​ 4,595​ 455 11.0 ​ 4,140​ 668 19.2 ​ 3,472​Other (a)​ 26​ (8) *​ 34​ 76 *​ (42)​Corporate and Other (b)​​ (1,256)​​ (47)​3.9 ​​ (1,209)​​ (213)​21.4 ​​ (996)​Total​$ 3,365​$ 400 13.5 % $ 2,965​$ 531 21.8 % $ 2,434​Percentage of revenues​​ 17.1%​​ ​​​ 16.5%​​ ​​​ 16.0%* Percentage change does not provide a meaningful comparison.(a)“Other” includes (i) elements of our WMSBS business that are not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) elements of our sustainability business that includes landfill gas-to-energy operations managed by our WM Renewable Energy business, our SES business and recycling brokerage services and not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions and (iv) the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.(b)“Corporate and Other” operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, digital, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills. Income from operations for “Corporate and Other” also includes costs associated with our long-term incentive program.Solid Waste — The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2022 are summarized below:●Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume. This increase was partially offset by (i) inflationary cost pressures; (ii) labor cost increases from frontline employee wage adjustments; (iii) divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items discussed above in (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net; that impacted our East Tier results and (iv) reduced profitability in our recycling business from the decline in recycling commodity prices and lower volumes.●Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume, as well as the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) improved profitability in our recycling business from higher market prices for recycling commodities and improved costs at facilities where we have made investments in enhanced technology and equipment and (iii) changes from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items discussed above in (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net that impacted both Tiers’ results. These increases were partially offset by (i) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth; (ii) increased landfill depletion from higher volumes and revisions in landfill estimates, including the anticipated timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities at certain landfills and adjustments in 2020 to the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations that benefitted costs in 2020 and (iii) inflationary cost pressures. During 2021, the positive earnings contributions from Advanced Disposal were offset by elevated depreciation, depletion and amortization of acquired assets.48 Table of ContentsOther — The decrease in income from operations in 2022, as compared with 2021, was due to the recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs, as well as, a prior year gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our Other segment, discussed above in (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net, partially offset by improved profitability in our SES and WMSBS businesses. The increase in income from operations for 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily driven by increased market values for renewable energy credits generated by our WM Renewable Energy business.​Corporate and Other — The most significant items affecting the results of operations for Corporate and Other during the three years ended December 31, 2022 are summarized below:●These costs increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to strategic investments in our digital platform and sustainability initiatives, partially offset by lower acquisition and integration related costs.●These costs increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) strategic investments in our digital platform; (iv) increased health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to pre-pandemic levels from the lower levels experienced during 2020 and (v) charges pertaining to reserves for certain loss contingencies during 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in the fourth quarter of 2020 and changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in both 2020 and 2021. Interest Expense, NetOur interest expense, net was $378 million, $365 million and $425 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2022 was primarily related to borrowings incurred under our $1.0 billion two-year, U.S. term credit agreement (“Term Loan”) and increases in interest rates on our floating-rate debt, including commercial paper and variable-rate tax-exempt bonds. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from higher capitalized interest and increases in interest income as a result of higher cash and cash equivalent balances.The decrease in interest expense, net for 2021 was primarily due to certain refinancing activities, as discussed further below, including (i) the redemption of $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2020 and the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes in November 2020 at lower rates and (ii) the retirement of $1.3 billion of certain high-coupon senior notes and concurrent issuance of $950 million of lower coupon senior notes in May 2021. The decreases were partially offset by decreases in interest income as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents balances in 2021. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our debt balances.Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net In May 2021, WMI issued $950 million of senior notes. Concurrently, we used the net proceeds from the newly issued senior notes of $942 million and available cash on hand to retire $1.3 billion of certain high-coupon senior notes. The loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2021 includes $220 million of charges related to this tender offer, including cash paid of $211 million related to premiums and other third-party costs, and $9 million primarily related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these transactions.In July 2020, we recognized a $52 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the mandatory redemption of $3.0 billion of senior notes with a special mandatory redemption feature (the “SMR Notes”). The loss includes $30 million of premiums paid and $22 million of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Pursuant to the terms of the SMR Notes, we were required to redeem all of such outstanding notes paying debt holders 101% of the aggregate principal amounts of such notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, as a result of the Advanced Disposal acquisition not being completed by July 14, 2020. Accordingly, the redemption was completed on 49 Table of ContentsJuly 20, 2020 using available cash on hand and, to a lesser extent, commercial paper borrowings. The cash paid included the $3.0 billion principal amount of debt redeemed, $30 million of related premiums and $8 million of accrued interest. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we repaid the outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility and contemporaneously terminated the facility, at which time we recognized a $2 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, at the time of acquisition, Advanced Disposal had outstanding $425 million of 5.625% senior notes due November 2024. In November 2020, we redeemed the notes pursuant to an optional redemption feature upon which we recognized a $1 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations due to the difference in carrying value and redemption price.Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated EntitiesWe recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $67 million, $36 million and $68 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The losses for each period were primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments, which are discussed further in Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also held a residual financial interest in an entity that owned a refined coal facility that qualified for federal tax credits. In 2020, the entity sold the majority of its assets resulting in a $7 million non-cash impairment charge at that time. Income Tax ExpenseWe recorded income tax expense of $678 million, $532 million and $397 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 23.2%, 22.6% and 20.9% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following:●Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits — Our low-income housing properties investments reduced our income tax expense by $99 million, $74 million and $87 million, primarily due to tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities;●Equity-Based Compensation — During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a reduction in our income tax expense of $17 million, $18 million and $27 million, respectively, for excess tax benefits related to the vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation awards;●State Net Operating Losses and Credits — During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction in our income tax expense of $8 million, $15 million and $12 million, respectively; ●Tax Audit Settlements — We file income tax returns in the U.S. and Canada, as well as other state and local jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by various taxing authorities and our audits are in various stages of completion. During the reported periods, we settled various tax audits, which resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of $6 million, $13 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively;●Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes — Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes primarily due to the filing of our income tax returns, analysis of our deferred tax balances and uncertain tax positions, and changes in state and foreign laws resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of $1 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a reduction in our income tax expense of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020;●Tax Implications of Divestitures – During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain non-strategic Canadian operations. This gain was not taxable, which benefited our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021;50 Table of Contents●Non-Deductible Transaction Costs — During 2020, we recognized the detrimental tax impact of $27 million of non-deductible transaction costs related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The tax rules require the capitalization of certain facilitative costs on the acquisition of stock of a company resulting in the applicable costs not being deductible for tax purposes; and●Tax Legislation — The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022 and contains a number of tax-related provisions. The provisions of the IRA related to alternative fuel tax credits secure approximately $55 million of annual pre-tax benefit (to be recorded as a reduction in our operating expense) from tax credits through 2024, which is in line with the benefit we have realized from our alternative fuel tax credits in prior years. Additionally, we will incur an excise tax of 1% for future common stock repurchases, which will be reflected in the cost of purchasing the underlying shares as a component of treasury stock. The IRA contains a number of additional provisions related to tax incentives for investments in renewable energy production, carbon capture, and other climate actions, as well as the overall measurement of corporate income taxes. Given the complexity and uncertainty around the applicability of the legislation to our specific facts and circumstances, we continue to analyze the IRA provisions to identify and quantify potential opportunities and applicable benefits included in the legislation. The current expectation is the minimum corporate tax will not have an impact on the Company. With respect to only the investment tax credit aspect of the IRA, we expect the cumulative benefit to be between $250 million and $350 million, a large portion of which is anticipated to be realized in 2025. Additionally, the production tax credit incentives for investments in renewable energy and the carbon capture provisions of the IRA will likely result in incremental benefit, although at this time the amount of those benefits have not been quantified. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to income taxes. Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and AnalysisWe owned or operated 254 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2022 and 255 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2021. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the year ended December 31 and remaining airspace, measured in cubic yards of waste, as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022​2021​​Remaining​​​​​Remaining​​​​​​Permitted​ Expansion​Total​Permitted​Expansion​Total​​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​Capacity​CapacityBalance as of beginning of year (in tons)​ 4,889​ 174​ 5,063​ 4,891​ 191​ 5,082Acquisitions, divestitures, newly permitted landfills and closures 163 — 163 (4) — (4)Changes in expansions pursued (a) — 62 62 — 105 105Expansion permits granted (b) 57 (57) — 126 (126) —Depletable tons received (125) — (125) (124) — (124)Changes in engineering estimates and other (c) (d) 181 11 192 — 4 4Balance as of end of year (in tons) (e) 5,165 190 5,355 4,889 174 5,063Balance as of end of year (in cubic yards) (e) 5,079 180 5,259 4,808 163 4,971(a)Amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any.(b)We received expansion permits at 12 of our landfills during 2022 and seven of our landfills during 2021, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal airspace of our existing landfills.(c)Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining airspace of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill airspace, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and 51 Table of Contentsprojected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.(d)In 2022, a change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase of 190 million tons across certain landfills. (e)See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of converting remaining cubic yards of airspace to tons of capacity.The depletable tons received at our landfills for the year ended December 31 are shown below (tons in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022​2021​ # of Depletable Tons per # of Depletable Tons per​ Sites Tons Day Sites Tons DaySolid waste landfills (a) 254(b) 123,462 452 255 123,163 451Hazardous waste landfills 5 652 2 5 586 2​ 259 124,114 454 260 123,749 453Solid waste landfills closed, divested or lease or other contractual agreement expired during related year 4 633 9 114 ​ 124,747​ 123,863(c) (a)As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 15 landfills and 14 landfills, respectively, which were not accepting waste.(b)In 2022, we (i) executed one new contractual agreement; (ii) reopened one previously closed landfill; (iii) developed one new landfill; (iv) closed three landfills and (v) closed one landfill operated under contractual agreement.(c)December 31, 2021 tons have been restated for comparability purposes by removing 1.6 million tons received at the landfill that were not depleted as they were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill.As of December 31, 2022, we owned or controlled the management of 231 sites with remedial activities, are in closure or have received a certification of closure or post-closure from the applicable regulatory agency.Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2022 and projected annual disposal volume, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 16 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills section below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 40 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.52 Table of ContentsThe number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2022, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:​​​​​ # of Landfills​0 to 5 years 28​6 to 10 years 23​11 to 20 years 53​21 to 40 years 62​41+ years 93​Total 259(a)(a)Of the 259 landfills, 218 are owned, 29 are operated under lease agreements and 12 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.The changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace depletion for the year ended December 31, 2022 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ Accumulated ​Net Book​​Cost Basis of​Landfill Airspace​​Value of​ Landfill Assets Depletion Landfill AssetsDecember 31, 2021​$ 17,734​$ (10,390)​$ 7,344Capital additions​ 791​ —​ 791Asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized​ 114​ —​ 114Depletion of landfill airspace​ —​ (754)​ (754)Foreign currency translation​ (81)​ 36​ (45)Asset retirements and other adjustments​ (32)​ 212​ 180December 31, 2022​$ 18,526​$ (10,896)​$ 7,630​As of December 31, 2022, we estimate that we will spend approximately $731 million in 2023, and approximately $1.6 billion in 2024 and 2025 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities — As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.53 Table of ContentsThe changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 are reflected in the table below (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​Environmental​ Landfill RemediationDecember 31, 2021​$ 2,326​$ 213Obligations incurred and capitalized​ 114 —Obligations settled​ (121) (28)Interest accretion​ 108 4Revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions (a)​ 243 15Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments ​ (6) —December 31, 2022​$ 2,664​$ 204(a)In 2021, the increase in our landfill liabilities for revisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions was $33 million. The increase in our landfill liabilities in 2022 is primarily due to inflationary cost pressures that are expected to impact costs over the remaining landfill lives.Landfill Operating Costs — The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2022 2021 2020Interest accretion on landfill liabilities​$ 108​$ 108​$ 103Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets​ (10)​ (2)​ 9Leachate and methane collection and treatment​ 193​ 183​ 189Landfill remediation costs​ 12​ 6​ 1Other landfill site costs​ 118​ 117​ 92Total landfill operating costs​$ 421​$ 412​$ 394​Depletion of Landfill Airspace — Depletion of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, includes the following:●the depletion of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and●the depletion of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.Depletion expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the depletable basis of a landfill (net of accumulated depletion) by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, depleted on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, depleted on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton depletion rates.54 Table of ContentsThe following table presents our landfill airspace depletion expense on a per-ton basis for the year ended December 31:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Depletion of landfill airspace (in millions)​$ 754​$ 731​$ 568Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)​ 125​ 124​ 112Average landfill airspace depletion expense per ton​$ 6.05​$ 5.90​$ 5.07​Different per-ton depletion rates are applied at each of our 259 landfills, and per-ton depletion rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace depletion expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company consistently generates annual cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds our working capital needs, allows for payment of our dividends, investment in the business through capital expenditures and tuck-in acquisitions, and funding of strategic sustainability growth investments. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business requirements that may arise during the year. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings, large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing to meet its ongoing capital, operating, strategic and other liquidity requirements. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 (other than recorded obligations related to liabilities associated with environmental remediation costs and non-cancelable operating lease obligations, which are discussed further in Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter TotalRecorded Obligations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities (a)​$ 137​$ 219​$ 212​$ 181​$ 147​$ 3,162​$ 4,058Debt payments (b)​ 2,423​ 1,290​ 1,324​ 673​ 1,163​ 8,275​ 15,148Unrecorded Obligations:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​Interest on debt (c)​ 451​ 384​ 349​ 326​ 297​ 2,691​ 4,498Estimated unconditional purchase obligations (d)​ 192​ 158​ 114​ 101​ 34​ 369​ 968Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2022​$ 3,203​$ 2,051​$ 1,999​$ 1,281​$ 1,641​$ 14,497​$ 24,672(a)Includes liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure costs will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills.(b)These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments based on their contractual maturities related to our long-term debt and financing leases, excluding interest. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations.(c)Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had $89 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations.(d)Our unrecorded obligations represent purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future 55 Table of Contentsfinancial position, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations and guarantees. Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Funds and Debt ObligationsThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds and debt balances as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021Cash and cash equivalents​$ 351​$ 118Restricted funds:​ ​ ​Insurance reserves​$ 313​$ 305Final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation funds​​ 113​​ 118Other​ 5​ 5Total restricted funds (a)​$ 431​$ 428Debt:​ ​ Current portion​$ 414​$ 708Long-term portion​ 14,570​ 12,697Total debt​$ 14,984​$ 13,405(a)As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $83 million and $80 million, respectively, of these account balances was included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Debt — We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2022 are described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $3.1 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program (net of related discount on issuance); (ii) $725 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities; (iii) $500 million of 2.4% senior notes that mature in May 2023 and (iv) $192 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $65 million of tax-exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2022, we have classified $2.7 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $3.5 billion long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”). The remaining $414 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations.In May 2022, WMI issued $1.0 billion of 4.15% senior notes due April 15, 2032, the net proceeds of which were $992 million. We used the net proceeds to redeem our $500 million of 2.9% senior notes due September 2022 in advance of their scheduled maturity, to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.​In May 2022, we entered into a Term Loan to be used for general corporate purposes and as of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings. WM Holdings guarantees all of the obligations under the Term Loan. ​See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the debt transactions.​56 Table of ContentsWe have credit lines in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility as of December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021Revolving credit facility (a)​$ 166​$ 167Other letter of credit lines (b)​ 800​ 764​​$ 966​$ 931(a)As of December 31, 2022, we had an unused and available credit capacity of $1.6 billion.(b)As of December 31, 2022, these other letter of credit lines are uncommitted with terms extending through April 2024. Amendment and Extension of Revolving Credit FacilityIn May 2022, we amended and restated our $3.5 billion U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility extending the term through May 2027. The agreement includes a $1.0 billion accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods, and we have the option to request up to two one-year extensions. Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., each an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, are borrowers under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and the agreement permits borrowing in Canadian dollars up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $375 million, with such borrowings to be repaid in Canadian dollars. WM Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, guarantees all the obligations under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Guarantor Financial InformationWM Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior indebtedness. WMI has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WM Holdings’ senior indebtedness. None of WMI’s other subsidiaries have guaranteed any of WMI’s or WM Holdings’ debt. In lieu of providing separate financial statements for the subsidiary issuer and guarantor (WMI and WM Holdings), we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for WMI and WM Holdings on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions between WMI and WM Holdings and amounts related to investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (in millions):​​​​​​ December 31,2022Balance Sheet Information:​​​Current assets $ 193Noncurrent assets​​ 14Current liabilities​ 325Noncurrent liabilities:​​​Advances due to affiliates​​ 19,740Other noncurrent liabilities​ 12,618​​​​​​ Year Ended​​December 31, 2022Income Statement Information:​​​Revenue $ —Operating income​​ —Net loss​​ 184​​57 Table of ContentsSummary of Cash Flow ActivityThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Net cash provided by operating activities​$ 4,536​$ 4,338​$ 3,403Net cash used in investing activities​$ (3,063)​$ (1,894)​$ (4,847)Net cash used in financing activities​$ (1,216)​$ (2,900)​$ (1,559)​Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — Our operating cash flows for 2022, as compared with 2021, increased by $198 million. The increase was largely driven by increased earnings in our collection and disposal and WM Renewable Energy businesses. We also experienced lower interest payments due to timing and refinancing activities in 2021 that reduced our overall interest rate. Partially offsetting our increase in cash from operating activities were higher income tax payments as a result of higher earnings in 2022 and a deposit of approximately $103 million that was made to the IRS related to a disputed tax matter. The Company expects to seek a refund of the entire amount deposited with the IRS and litigate any denial of the claim for refund. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Our operating cash flows for 2021, as compared with 2020, increased by $935 million largely as a result of (i) an increase in earnings primarily attributable to our collection, disposal and recycling lines of business; (ii) our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) lower interest payments in 2021 primarily due to certain refinancing activities and the retirement of high-coupon debt during 2020 reducing our overall interest rates; (iv) lower income taxes paid in 2021 and (v) favorable changes in our working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures. Our working capital was favorably impacted by process improvements that contributed to a significant improvement in our days-to-collect metrics. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash tax benefits received in 2020 associated with federal alternative fuel tax credits.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Acquisitions — Our spending on acquisitions was $377 million, $76 million and $4,088 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which $377 million, $75 million and $4,085 million, respectively, are considered cash used in investing activities. The remaining spend is financing or operating activities related to the timing of contingent consideration paid. Substantially all of these acquisitions are related to our Solid Waste business. Our acquisition spending in 2022 was primarily attributable to the purchase of a controlling interest in a business intended to accelerate our film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities. Our acquisition spending in 2020 was primarily attributable to Advanced Disposal. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings.●Capital Expenditures — We used $2,587 million, $1,904 million and $1,632 million for capital expenditures in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 is primarily driven by our intentional investment in growth capital spending on recycling and renewable energy projects, as well as timing differences in our fixed asset purchases to support our ongoing operations. The increase in 2021 is due in part to intentional steps the Company took to accelerate growth capital spending on recycling and renewable energy projects. Additionally, in 2020 we took proactive steps to reduce the amount of capital spending required due to the decrease in volumes as a result of COVID-19. The Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management to prioritize investments for expansion, the replacement of aging assets and assets that support our strategy of continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. In addition, we continue to make progress on our planned investments to expand our renewable energy and recycling businesses. We expect to spend between $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion on capital expenditures to support our normal course business in 2023. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion on capital expenditures for recycling and renewable energy growth projects in 2023.●Proceeds from Divestitures — Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested, were $27 million, $96 million and $885 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, our proceeds are primarily the result of the sale of certain non-strategic Canadian operations. In 2020, our proceeds included 58 Table of Contents$856 million related to the sale of assets required to be sold by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The remaining amounts in 2022, 2021 and 2020 generally related to the sale of fixed assets. ●Other, Net — Our spending within other, net was $126 million, $11 million, and $15 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we used $23 million, $32 million and $14 million, respectively, of cash from restricted cash and cash equivalents to invest in available-for-sale securities. In 2022, we used $67 million to fund secured convertible promissory notes associated with an acquisition and $28 million to make an initial cash payment associated with a low-income housing investment. Our 2021 cash spend was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of an equity method investment. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities — The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:●Debt Borrowings (Repayments) — The following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Borrowings: ​ ​​ ​​ Revolving credit facility $ —​$ —​$ 50Commercial paper program (a) ​ 6,596​​ 6,831​​ 3,630364-day revolving credit facility (b) ​ —​​ —​​ 3,000Term loan​​ 1,000​​ —​​ —Senior notes​​ 992​​ 942​​ 2,479Tax-exempt bonds​​ 100​​ 175​​ 261​ $ 8,688​$ 7,948​$ 9,420Repayments: ​ ​ Revolving credit facility $ —​$ —​$ (50)Commercial paper program (a) ​ (6,664)​​ (6,872)​​ (1,822)364-day revolving credit facility (b) ​ —​​ —​​ (3,000)Senior notes​​ (500)​​ (1,289)​​ (4,000)Advanced Disposal senior notes (c)​​ —​​ —​​ (437)Tax-exempt bonds (71)​ (127)​ (212)Other debt (93)​ (116)​ (108)​ $ (7,328)​$ (8,404)​$ (9,629)Net cash borrowings (repayments)​$ 1,360​$ (456)​$ (209)(a)Commercial paper borrowings incurred in 2022 and 2021 were primarily to support acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Commercial paper borrowings incurred in 2020 were used for the redemption of the SMR Notes and to partially fund our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. (b)In November 2020, we terminated our 364-day revolving facility contemporaneously with repayment of all outstanding borrowings with proceeds from our November 2020 senior notes issuance.(c)Advanced Disposal had certain outstanding senior notes which were redeemed in 2020 pursuant to an optional redemption feature as further discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments.●Premiums and Other Paid on Early Extinguishment of Debt — During 2021, we paid premiums and other third-party costs of $211 million to retire certain high-coupon notes as discussed further in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2020, we paid premiums of $30 million to redeem $3.0 billion of senior notes that contained a special mandatory redemption feature tied to the timing of the Advanced Disposal acquisition closing. See Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net for further discussion.59 Table of Contents●Common Stock Repurchase Program — For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We allocated $1,500 million, $1,350 million and $402 million of available cash to common stock repurchases during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We announced in December 2022 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.5 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations and listed below, as well as market conditions.●Cash Dividends — For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $1,077 million in 2022, or $2.60 per common share, $970 million in 2021, or $2.30 per common share, and $927 million in 2020, or $2.18 per common share.In December 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.65 to $0.70 per share for dividends declared in 2023. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.●Exercise of Common Stock Options — The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $44 million, $66 million and $63 million from the exercise of 675,000, 962,000 and 1,039,000 of employee stock options during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Free Cash FlowWe are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the year ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Net cash provided by operating activities ​$ 4,536​$ 4,338​$ 3,403Capital expenditures to support the business​​ (2,026)​​ (1,665)​​ (1,606)Capital expenditures - sustainability growth investments (a)​​ (561)​​ (239)​​ (26)Total Capital expenditures​ (2,587)​ (1,904)​ (1,632)Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested​ 27​ 96​ 885Free cash flow​$ 1,976​$ 2,530​$ 2,656(a)These growth investments are intended to further our sustainability leadership position by increasing recycling volumes and growing renewable natural gas generation. We expect they will deliver circular solutions for our customers and drive environmental value to the communities we serve. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and 60 Table of Contentsassumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.Landfills Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities and (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace.Landfill Costs — We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining depletable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace depletion, and projections of future purchase and development costs.Final Capping Costs — We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events and the capping costs are depleted as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be depleted immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event at a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace depletion.Closure and Post-Closure Costs — We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be depleted immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace depletion.Remaining Permitted Airspace — Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.Expansion Airspace — We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely. 61 Table of ContentsSecond, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years, in addition to meeting the following criteria:●Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;●We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;●There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and●Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the depletable basis of the landfill.Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will consider several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton depletion rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower earnings may be experienced due to higher depletion rates or higher expenses; or higher earnings may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher depletion expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.Environmental Remediation LiabilitiesA significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws 62 Table of Contentsand regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:●Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;●Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;●The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and●The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and LiabilitiesSignificant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance.Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.Property and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, 63 Table of Contentsafter consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill — At least annually using a measurement date of October 1, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs.We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicates a possible impairment, we complete a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach using Level 3 inputs. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.Acquisitions — In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid for an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. When we are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition, there can be subsequent adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation. Generally, the valuation of our acquired asset and liabilities rely on complex estimates and assumptions.Acquisition-date fair value estimates are revised as necessary if, and when, additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to finalization of purchase accounting, these revisions are accounted for as adjustments to income from operations. All acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions, including our 2020 acquisition of Advanced Disposal.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net. InflationMacroeconomic pressures, including inflation and market disruption resulting in labor, supply chain and transportation constraints are continuing. Significant global supply chain disruption and the heightened pace of inflation has reduced availability and increased costs for the goods and services we purchase, with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs. Supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet, steel containers and other purchases. Aspects of our business rely on third-party transportation providers, and such services have become more limited and expensive. Our overall strategic pricing efforts are focused on recovering as much of the inflationary cost increases we experience in our business as possible by increasing our average unit rate, but such efforts may not be successful for various reasons including the pace of inflation, operating cost inefficiencies, contractual limitations, and market responses. Throughout 2022, many of these contract lookback provisions began to capture the inflationary cost increases experienced since the second half of 2021 in the price escalation calculation; however, such timing lag persists and will continue to restrict our ability to address proactively future rapid cost increases for those contracts. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. 64 Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2022.Interest Rate Exposure — Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2022, we had $15.1 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $3.5 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised primarily of (i) $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program; (ii) $1.0 billion of long-term borrowings under our $1.0 billion, two-year, U.S. term credit agreement and (iii) $725 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2023 interest expense by $28 million.Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $700 million as of December 31, 2022.We are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust fund accounts. These assets are generally invested in high-quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust fund account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which generally mature over the next nine years, as well as equity securities.Commodity Price Exposure — In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel, electricity (and related renewable energy credits) and recycled materials, including old corrugated cardboard and plastics. We work to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues, operating costs and margins may also increase or decrease. Recycling revenues attributable to yield increased $19 million and $537 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities in 2021 and the first half of 2022, before the significant downturn in the second half of 2022. Demand for recycled materials strengthened through 2021 and into early 2022, primarily driven by the growth in e-commerce, businesses re-opening, and manufacturers committing to use more recycled content in their packaging. In 2022, we experienced all-time high recycling commodity pricing in the first half of the year to be followed by historically low pricing through the second half of the year, resulting from the slowdown in the global economy, which reduced retail demand and the corresponding need for cardboard packaging to ship retail goods. We expect significant commodity price headwinds to continue into 2023. Average market prices for recycling commodities at the Company’s facilities were approximately 10% lower and 115% higher in 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared with the prior year periods. Revenue decline from lower commodity pricing was offset by higher pricing in our recycling brokerage business as well as our continued focus on a fee-based pricing model that ensures fees paid by customers cover the cost of processing materials and the impact on our cost structure of managing contamination in the recycling stream. Variability in commodity prices can also impact the margins of our business as certain components of our revenue are structured as a pass through of costs, including recycling brokerage and fuel surcharges.65 Table of ContentsThe primary drivers of renewable fuel development at our landfills are tax policies, such as the recently expanded federal tax credits for renewable natural gas (“RNG”) production and renewable electricity generation, and federal and state incentive programs, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. At the federal level, oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, referred to as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), from renewable fuel producers. The Company has invested, and continues to invest, in facilities that capture and convert landfill gas into RNG, and also works with facilities that capture and convert dairy digester gas into RNG, so that we can participate in the program, and the Company has stated its intention to grow its asset base to notably increase its RNG production by 2026. RINs prices generally respond to regulations enacted by the EPA, as well as fluctuations in supply and demand. The value of the RINs associated with RNG is set through a market established by the program.Prior to 2022, the EPA has promulgated rules on an annual basis establishing refiners’ obligations to purchase RNG and other cellulosic biofuels under the RFS program; however, the EPA issued a highly anticipated proposed rule in late 2022 setting forth the direction of the RFS program for compliance years 2023 through 2025. Although this proposal delivers on many reforms that benefit the solid waste sector, the EPA’s programmatic shift towards multi-year standards could lead to market uncertainty and volatility in the price of RINs. We continue to advocate for the current administration to implement policies that ensure long term stability for renewable transportation fuels and expand opportunities for the biogas sector to participate in the RFS program. Changes in the RFS market, the structure of the RFS program or RINs prices and demand can and has impacted the financial performance of the facilities constructed to capture and treat the gas. Such changes could impact or alter our projected future investments, and such investments may not yield the results anticipated.Currency Rate Exposure — We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. ​66 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:44:15.966140
