936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2003,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Lockheed Martin Corporation December 31, 2002 Industry Considerations Defense Business Considerations In recent years, domestic and worldwide political and economic developments have had a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems, products and services. Markets for defense and advanced technology systems during 2002 and in the foreseeable future will continue to be affected by the worldwide war against terrorism and threats created by the potential widespread availability of weapons of mass destruction. These realities have increased the need for greater attention to the security of our homeland and for better communication and interplay between law enforcement, civil government agencies and our military services. Our nation’s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more capabilities-based structure, which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility, stronger space capabilities, better missile defense and improved information systems security. The President’s budget for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for fiscal year 2003 and beyond reflects the transformation of the country’s national defense posture and responds to increased needs for homeland security and defeating terrorism. This is evidenced by budget increases for operational readiness and personnel needs, as well as for both procurement and research and development. While there is no assurance that the increased DoD budget levels will be approved by Congress, the current defense budget outlook is one of modest growth. However, the level of growth and the amount of the budget that will ultimately be allocated to the investment accounts (i.e., procurement, research and development) is unknown. Our broad mix of programs and capabilities gives us the ability to support the needs of the various agencies of the U.S. Government that require our products and services. Our product areas and programs include: missile defense; space intelligence; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); air mobility aircraft; and air power projection/precision strike capability. In terms of size and long-term potential impact, two of our more important programs are the F/A-22 fighter aircraft program and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. We are also represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the PAC-3 and THAAD programs. In the areas of space intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on the Milstar, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H) programs, and in battle management command and control capabilities. In airlift, we have the C-130J program and are under contract to upgrade the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. Many of these programs are large and require funding over several budget cycles. There are risks associated with these and other large, highly visible programs that are subject to appropriation by Congress which, because of their size, could be expected to become potential targets for reductions or extensions of their funding to pay for other programs. 40 In addition, the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, information systems security and other technical systems solutions. Recent trends have indicated an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems. This is an area where we have continued to focus our resources. In prior years, companies in our industry had reacted to historically shrinking defense budgets for procurement, research and development by combining to maintain critical mass and achieve cost savings. More recently, we have focused our efforts on cost savings and improving efficiency, as well as generating cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation. Through our consolidation activities, we have been able to pass along savings to our customers, mainly the DoD. Non-U.S. defense budgets have generally been declining over the past decade. As a result, consolidation has also been occurring in the European aerospace industry, resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors, potentially resulting in an environment where there could be less demand abroad for products from U.S. companies. This type of environment could reduce opportunities for European partnerships and sales potential for U.S. exports. Other Business Considerations As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The Government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the Government could make claims against us. Under Government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Changes in government procurement policies and practices over the past several years, such as increases in the progress payment rate and the use of performance-based payments, have had a positive effect on our financial position and cash flows. But we are still exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties and obsolescence, and having to depend on Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost overruns and failures can occur. In addition to our defense businesses, we also provide products and services to civil government customers, as well as commercial customers. Relative to civil government customers, in 2002, a joint venture in which we are participating was awarded the contract for Deepwater, a modernization program for the Coast Guard’s fleet and systems. Our role will be 41 to provide systems integration and engineering; C4ISR; air assets; and integrated logistics support. In addition, we provide products and services to agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA and the Transportation Security Administration. Although our lines of business in civil government and commercial markets are not dependent on defense budgets, they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, as well as other risks unique to their particular marketplaces. These risks may include development of competing products, technological feasibility and product obsolescence. With respect to our work with NASA, we provide products and services for the Space Shuttle program mainly through our Space Systems and Technology Services business segments. In 2002, work for NASA accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net sales, of which approximately one-half was related to the Space Shuttle program. We also have a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC, which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. We are working with the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and NASA in the investigation of the February 2003 accident involving the Space Shuttle Columbia. This tragic event did not impact our results of operations for 2002, and it is too early to determine whether the accident will affect our business operations for 2003 and beyond. We have entered into various joint venture, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in commercial space as well as other lines of business. For additional information about these ventures, see the discussion in the next section concerning our “Commercial Space Business,” the discussion on page 51 captioned “Write-Off and Restructuring of Investment in Astrolink,” and the discussion on page 68 relating to Space Imaging under the caption “Capital Structure and Resources.” These arrangements generally include a formal plan for funding the business which usually requires commitments from the partners, and may require the business to get financing from other sources as well. To the extent the business is unable to get financing from other sources, the business partners, ourselves included, would be required to look at alternatives for funding the business. Some of these business arrangements include foreign partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Commercial Space Business The launch vehicle industry has continued to be affected by low demand for products and services due mainly to low demand for satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. Concerns over uncertainty in the economy have made it difficult for many ventures, especially telecommunications and other high-technology companies, to obtain funding from capital markets. Reduced demand and increased competition have also 42 caused pricing pressures in the launch vehicle market. This comes at a time when we have been making significant investments in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (Atlas V) program, our next generation launch vehicle. This program has required investment of funds for research and development, start-up and other nonrecurring costs, and launch facilities. Some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the U.S. Government. We had our first Atlas V launch in August 2002, successfully delivering a Eutelsat satellite into orbit. Orders to-date for the Atlas V launch vehicle have been lower than expected and at lower prices. Similar to the launch vehicle market, the commercial satellite market is experiencing pricing pressures due to excess capacity and lower demand. Satellite demand also has been impacted by the business difficulties encountered by some companies in the commercial satellite services industry which have resulted in reduced access to capital and a reduction in the total market size in the near term. We expect to continue to reduce costs in our commercial satellite manufacturing business while keeping our focus on providing a reliable product. In 1992, we entered into a joint venture with two Russian government-owned space firms to form Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International, Inc. (LKEI). We own 51% of LKEI. LKEI has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets from a launch site in Kazakhstan. In 1995, another joint venture was formed, International Launch Services (ILS), with Lockheed Martin and LKEI each holding a 50% ownership. ILS was formed to market commercial Atlas and Proton launch services around the world. We consolidate the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements. Contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer before the launch. At the end of 2002, $412 million of advances received from customers for Proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability on our balance sheet in the caption “Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred.” A sizable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for Proton launch services are sent to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev), the manufacturer of the launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in Russia. If a contracted launch service is not provided, a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer. In addition, we have sent advances to Khrunichev for launches we purchased which have not yet been assigned to customers. The advances sent to Khrunichev are included on our balance sheet in inventories. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we entered into an agreement with Khrunichev to eliminate the requirement to provide launch services for our prior advances that were not associated with specific customer launch orders in exchange for an arrangement to reduce future launch payments from us to Khrunichev, contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a minimum number of actual launches each year. Due to the continuing overcapacity in the launch vehicle market, we do not expect to recover amounts previously advanced for an extended period of time. In addition, we assessed the likelihood of customer terminations-for-convenience for launches currently under contract. A contract termination would require Khrunichev to refund a portion of the advances we have made to them and would require us to refund a portion of the advances received from the customer. As a result of these factors, we reduced the carrying value of our advances to Khrunichev and recognized a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $173 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The charge reduced net earnings by $112 million ($0.25 per share). At year-end 2002, $391 million of payments to Khrunichev were included in inventories. Our ability to realize the remaining amounts may be affected by Khrunichev’s ability to provide the 43 launch services and the political environment in Russia. Through the end of 2002, launch services through LKEI and ILS have been provided according to contract terms. The Corporation has entered into an agreement with RD AMROSS, a joint venture of the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation and the Russian firm NPO Energomash, for the development and purchase, subject to certain conditions, of RD-180 booster engines for use in the Corporation’s Atlas launch vehicles. Terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to RD AMROSS upon the achievement of certain milestones in the development and manufacturing processes. Approximately $61 million of payments made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the Corporation’s inventories at December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition A large part of our business is derived from long-term development and production contracts which we account for consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) audit and accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.” We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract. Generally, we record long-term fixed-price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenue. For certain other long-term fixed-price contracts which, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, revenues are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method of accounting. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. We record sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts as we incur the costs. As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting versus when we use the units-of-delivery method. We have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long-term contracts. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are 44 considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award fees are also a significant factor in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Products and services provided under long-term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business, and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. We follow U.S. Government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel perform reviews of the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with income or expense for qualified defined benefit plans (pension plans) because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (FAS 87). Those rules require that the amounts we record, including the income or expense for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the following fiscal year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels. We use judgment in selecting these assumptions each year because we have to consider not only current market conditions, but also make judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. An actual example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in 2002. Based on our review of market trends, actual returns on plan assets, and other factors, we lowered the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our year-end 2002 actuarial calculations to 8.5%, versus 9.5% for 2001. This rate is applied to a calculated value of 45 plan assets which results in an amount that is included in pension income or expense in the following year. We also lowered the discount rate assumption to 6.75% at year-end 2002, versus 7.25% used for 2001. These changes, together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets, result in our projecting a substantial amount of pension expense for 2003, compared to recording pension income in 2002. Also, at the end of 2002, we recorded an adjustment in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for most of our pension plans. This adjustment is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and is determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for the plan to the fair value of that plan’s assets. The amount by which the ABO exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan, must be recorded as a minimum pension liability, with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset, if appropriate, and a reduction to stockholders’ equity, consistent with FAS 87. The noncash after-tax adjustment related to our recording of a minimum pension liability in 2002 did not impact earnings, but reduced our stockholders’ equity by $1.5 billion. This adjustment is computed at each year-end and could potentially reverse in the future if financial markets improve and interest rates increase, or could potentially increase if financial market performance and interest rates continue to decline. The total funding requirement for our pension plans under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in 2002 was $87 million. CAS is a major factor in determining our funding requirements and governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. For 2003, we expect our funding requirements under CAS to increase substantially. This amount is recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore is recognized in our net sales. Also in 2003, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code rules. Any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and therefore are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods. Impairment of Investments in Equity Securities We have investments in equity securities of several companies, some of which are publicly traded entities. We review these investments each quarter to evaluate our ability to recover our investments. We record an impairment charge if the fair value of the investment has declined below our carrying value, and that decline is viewed to be other than temporary. For publicly traded companies, the fair value of the equity securities is determined by multiplying the number of shares we own by the stock price, as well as by computing estimates of the fair values based on a variety of valuation methods (e.g., discounted cash flow analyses, sum-of-the-parts valuations and trading multiples). For those companies that are not publicly traded, we prepare discounted cash flow analyses to compute an estimate of the fair value of the investment. Since we generally do not have access to internal projections of those companies, we prepare projections based on information that is publicly available. We use judgment in computing the fair value based on our evaluation of the investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations. In selecting these and other assumptions, we consider the investee’s ability to execute their business plan successfully, 46 including their ability to obtain required funding, general market conditions, and industry considerations specific to their business. It is likely that we could compute a materially different fair value for an investment if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change. Many of our investments are concentrated in the satellite services and telecommunications industries, including Intelsat, Ltd. (Intelsat), Inmarsat Ventures plc (Inmarsat) and New Skies Satellites, N.V. (New Skies). These industries continue to be affected by the capital markets, excess satellite capacity and competition from other kinds of telecommunications services, including fiber optic cable and other wireless communication technologies. This has been evidenced by recent bankruptcy filings by some telecommunications companies. Intelsat, Inmarsat and New Skies are also subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC decisions and policies have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on these companies. In 2000, Congress passed the Open-Market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act (the ORBIT Act) that, among other things, established deadlines for Intelsat and Inmarsat to complete their initial public offerings. Under the ORBIT Act, Intelsat and Inmarsat were required to complete their initial public offerings by December 31, 2002. However, Inmarsat has received an extension from the FCC until June 30, 2003. In October 2002, legislation was enacted which extends the deadline for Intelsat to complete its initial public offering to December 31, 2003, or June 30, 2004 if approved by the FCC. Unless there are changes in the current trends and market conditions in the telecommunications industry, as well as in the capital markets, Intelsat and Inmarsat may have difficulty in completing their initial public offerings by the ORBIT Act deadlines. If those deadlines are not met or extended by further amendments to the legislation, the FCC may limit access by U.S. users to the satellite capacity of the privatized entities for some services. If this were to occur, the value of our investments could be adversely affected. In the fourth quarter 2002, as part of the ongoing evaluation of our ability to recover our investments, we calculated an estimate of the current fair values of our investments in Intelsat and Inmarsat. For our investment in New Skies, we calculated the current fair value based on the publicly traded stock price and, for analysis purposes, also calculated an estimate of the fair value using discounted cash flow analyses. In each case, the fair value of our investment was less than our carrying amount. We then made an assessment as to whether the decline in the value of these investments was other than temporary. We reviewed investment analyst reports to the extent they were available. We also assessed future business prospects for the companies and reviewed information regarding market and industry trends for their businesses. 47 Based on our evaluation, including the factors discussed above, we determined that the decline in values of these investments was other than temporary, and recorded impairment charges related to these investments in the fourth quarter of 2002. The impact of the unusual charges on operating profit (earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes), net earnings and diluted earnings per share was as follows: (In millions) Operating Profit Net Earnings Earnings per Diluted Share Write-down of investment in: Intelsat $ (572 ) $ (371 ) $ (0.82 ) Inmarsat (101 ) (66 ) (0.15 ) New Skies (103 ) (67 ) (0.15 ) Total write-down of telecommunications investments $ (776 ) $ (504 ) $ (1.12 ) Environmental Liabilities We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to, along with other factors, difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, and agreements between potentially responsible parties (PRPs) to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent of our obligation. These agreements usually cover several years which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due, for example, to changing remediation technologies. To determine total costs at clean-up sites, we have to assess the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, as well as continually evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remedial actions. Given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur as described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government in 1990 and 2000, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government businesses, after deducting any recoveries from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the end of 2002 and 2001, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was $445 million and $300 million, respectively. We have recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our 48 products and services for U.S. Government businesses. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are pursuing as required by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Any recoveries we receive would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government sales and cost of sales. Exit From the Global Telecommunications Services Business In December 2001, we announced that we would exit our global telecommunications services business as a result of continuing overcapacity in the telecommunications industry and weakening business and economic conditions in Latin America. We also decided in the fourth quarter of 2001 not to provide further funding to Astrolink International, LLC (Astrolink) and, mainly due to Astrolink’s inability to obtain additional funding from other sources, wrote off our investment in Astrolink. We recorded unusual charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to these actions. The charges reduced net earnings by about $1.7 billion ($3.98 per diluted share). The global telecommunications services businesses included the operations of COMSAT Corporation. We completed our merger with COMSAT Corporation in August 2000. The operations of COMSAT were included in the results of our operations since August 1, 2000. The total purchase price for COMSAT was approximately $2.6 billion. The COMSAT transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, where the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. These allocations included adjustments totaling approximately $2.1 billion to record investments in equity securities (i.e., Intelsat, Inmarsat and New Skies) at fair value, and goodwill. The global telecommunications businesses that we retained included the Systems & Technology line of business and the COMSAT General telecommunications business unit, which were realigned with the Space Systems segment, and Enterprise Solutions-U.S., which was realigned with the Technology Services segment. The equity investments retained, including Intelsat, Inmarsat and New Skies, ACeS International, Ltd. (ACeS), Americom Asia-Pacific, LLC and Astrolink, had a combined carrying value of about $900 million at December 31, 2002. The following discussion describes the components of the $2.0 billion in charges based on their classification in our financial statements. Discontinued Operations The $2.0 billion in charges in 2001 included an amount, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $1.4 billion related to global telecommunications services businesses held for sale and exit costs for the elimination of the administrative function supporting the global telecommunications businesses and investments. These charges, which reduced net earnings for the year by $1.3 billion ($3.09 per diluted share) were included in discontinued operations in our statement of operations. The status of the businesses held for sale is as follows: · Satellite Services businesses – In 2002, we completed the sale of COMSAT Mobile Communications and COMSAT World Systems. These transactions did not have a 49 material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We also reached an agreement to sell Lockheed Martin Intersputnik (LMI) in the third quarter of 2002. This transaction is expected to close in 2003, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions, including a requirement that we move the LMI satellite to another orbital slot. The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. · COMSAT International – In 2002, we completed the sale of an 81% ownership interest in COMSAT International. The transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Of the $1.4 billion of charges included in discontinued operations, about $1.2 billion related to impairment of goodwill. The goodwill was recorded when we acquired COMSAT as discussed above. Approximately $170 million of the $1.4 billion related to impairment of some of the long-lived assets employed by foreign businesses held for sale, mainly COMSAT International. The rest of the charge related to costs associated with elimination of administrative functions, including severance and facilities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted FAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Since the operating businesses we identified for divestiture met the requirements of FAS 144 to be classified as discontinued operations, their results of operations, as well as the impairment and other charges related to the decision to exit the businesses, are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and have been excluded from business segment information. Also, the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been shown separately in the balance sheet as being held for sale. Depreciation and amortization expense were not recorded for these businesses after the date they were classified as held for sale consistent with FAS 144. LMI is recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell at December 31, 2002. Changes in the estimated fair value of LMI will be recorded in the future if appropriate. We also completed the sale of Lockheed Martin IMS Corporation (IMS), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for $825 million in cash in August 2001. This transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $476 million and increased net earnings by $309 million ($0.71 per diluted share). The results of IMS’s operations for all periods presented, as well as the gain on the sale, are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with FAS 144. Net sales recorded in 2001 up to the effective date of the divestiture totaled approximately $355 million, excluding intercompany sales. The transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $560 million after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments. Other Charges Related to Global Telecommunications The charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 also included unusual charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $132 million related to commitments to and impairment in the values of investments in satellite joint ventures, primarily ACeS and Americom Asia-Pacific. We had previously recorded unusual charges related to other than temporary declines in the values of these investments as follows: in the first quarter of 2001, a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $100 million was recorded related to Americom Asia-Pacific; and in the fourth 50 quarter of 2000, a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $117 million was recorded related to ACeS (see Note 8 to the financial statements for more discussion of these charges). In addition, as part of the $2.0 billion in charges recorded in the fourth quarter 2001, about $43 million related to severance, facilities costs and impairment of certain fixed assets associated with the business units we retained. These unusual charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by $117 million ($0.27 per diluted share). Write-off and Restructuring of Investment in Astrolink Through 2001, we had invested $400 million in Astrolink, a joint venture that planned to develop a broad-band satellite system. In the fourth quarter of 2001, in light of market conditions affecting the telecommunications industry and the difficulty Astrolink was having raising external capital, we decided not to make an additional equity investment in Astrolink and wrote off our 31% equity interest. As a result, we recorded an unusual charge of $367 million, net of state income tax benefits, in other income and expenses to reflect the other than temporary decline in the value of our Astrolink investment. We also recorded charges of approximately $20 million, net of state income tax benefits, in cost of sales for certain other costs related to Astrolink. On a combined basis, these charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by approximately $267 million ($0.62 per diluted share). After several months of negotiation, in January 2003, we finalized an agreement with Astrolink’s other members to restructure Astrolink. As part of the transaction, Liberty Satellite & Technology, a subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation, may acquire substantially all of Astrolink’s assets and pursue a business plan to build a one- or two-satellite system. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, financing and other closing conditions. Upon closing of the asset transfer, we would continue to provide launch services and be a satellite vendor, but would retain only a limited indirect equity interest in the restructured business. The restructuring also entails the settlement of existing claims related to termination of Astrolink’s major procurement contracts. As part of that settlement, if Liberty Satellite & Technology does not elect to proceed with the new system, we would acquire the remaining assets of Astrolink, including work in process under our procurement contracts with Astrolink. Certain other of the members also would retain their work in process. Under either scenario, the restructuring is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other Divestiture Activities In January 2001, we completed the divestiture of two business units in the environmental management line of business. The impact of these divestitures was not material to our 2001 results of operations, cash flows or financial position due to the effects of unusual impairment losses recorded in prior years related to these business units. Those losses were included in other income and expenses as part of other portfolio shaping activities in the respective years. In November 2000, we sold our Aerospace Electronics Systems (AES) businesses for $1.67 billion in cash (the AES Transaction). We recorded an unusual loss, including state income taxes, of $598 million related to this transaction which is included in other income and expenses. The loss reduced net earnings for 2000 by $878 million ($2.18 per diluted share). Although the AES Transaction resulted in a pretax loss for book purposes, it resulted in a gain for tax purposes 51 primarily because goodwill related to the AES businesses was not included in the tax basis of the net assets of AES. Therefore, we were required to make state and federal income tax payments associated with the divestiture. The AES Transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments. Net sales included in the year 2000 related to the AES businesses totaled approximately $655 million, excluding intercompany sales. In September 2000, we sold Lockheed Martin Control Systems (Control Systems) for $510 million in cash. This transaction resulted in the recognition of an unusual gain, net of state income taxes, of $302 million which is reflected in other income and expenses. The gain increased net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $180 million ($0.45 per diluted share). This transaction generated net cash proceeds of $350 million after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments. Net sales for the first nine months of 2000 related to Control Systems totaled approximately $215 million, excluding intercompany sales. In September 2000, we sold approximately one-third of our interest in Inmarsat for $164 million. The investment in Inmarsat was acquired as part of the merger with COMSAT. As a result of the transaction, our interest in Inmarsat was reduced from approximately 22% to 14%. The sale of shares in Inmarsat did not impact our results of operations. The transaction generated net cash proceeds of about $115 million after transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to explore the sale of various non-core businesses, passive equity investments and surplus real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such holdings or real estate, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses, if any, would be recorded when they are probable and estimable. We also continue to review our businesses on an ongoing basis to identify ways to improve organizational effectiveness and performance, and to focus on our core business strategy. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” as discussed more fully in Note 1 of the notes to the financial statements. We completed the initial step of the goodwill impairment test required by the new rules and concluded that no adjustment to the balance of goodwill at the date we adopted the standard was required. We also reassessed the estimated remaining useful lives of other intangible assets as part of our adoption of the Statement. As a result of that review, we extended the estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset related to our F-16 fighter aircraft program from six to ten years, effective January 1, 2002. The most important factors considered in making this determination included the existing backlog for F-16 deliveries which extends production beyond the life we originally anticipated, and our outlook for potential new orders for the F-16 during the next ten years. Relative to new orders, we expect that the F-16 will continue to be the dominant fighter aircraft 52 available for many countries in the international market until the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is available. As a result of the adoption, amortization expense for goodwill and certain other intangibles for 2002 was lower compared to 2001 by $274 million, and was lower compared to 2000 by $297 million. Continuing Operations For 2002, net sales were $26.6 billion, an 11% increase over 2001 sales. Sales for 2001 were $24.0 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to 2000. Sales increased in all segments during 2002 as compared to 2001. Sales growth in our Aeronautics and Technology Services segments during 2001 were more than offset by decreases in the remaining business segments as compared to 2000. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, sales would have remained comparable when comparing 2001 to 2000. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 80% of our sales for 2002 compared to 78% in 2001 and 72% in 2000. 53 Our results of operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 included the effects of various unusual items. The impact of these items on operating profit (earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes), net earnings (loss) and amounts per diluted share is as follows: Effects of unusual items: (In millions) Operating (Loss) Profit Net (Loss) Earnings (Loss) Earnings per Diluted Share Year ended December 31, 2002 Continuing operations Write-down of telecommunications investments $ (776 ) $ (504 ) $ (1.12 ) Charge related to Russian advances (173 ) (112 ) (0.25 ) Write-down of investment in Space Imaging and charge related to recording of guarantee (163 ) (106 ) (0.23 ) R&D tax credit settlement — 90 0.20 $ (1,112 ) $ (632 ) $ (1.40 ) Year ended December 31, 2001 Continuing operations Write-off of investment in Astrolink and related costs $ (387 ) $ (267 ) $ (0.62 ) Write-down of investment in Loral Space (361 ) (235 ) (0.54 ) Other charges related to global telecommunications (176 ) (117 ) (0.27 ) Impairment charge related to Americom Asia-Pacific (100 ) (65 ) (0.15 ) Loss on early repayment of debt (55 ) (36 ) (0.08 ) Other portfolio shaping activities (5 ) (3 ) (0.01 ) Gain on sale of surplus real estate 111 72 0.17 (973 ) (651 ) (1.50 ) Discontinued operations—Charges related to discontinued businesses, net of IMS gain — (1,027 ) (2.38 ) $ (973 ) $ (1,678 ) $ (3.88 ) Year ended December 31, 2000 Continuing operations Loss related to AES Transaction $ (598 ) $ (878 ) $ (2.18 ) Loss on early repayment of debt (146 ) (95 ) (0.24 ) Charge related to Globalstar guarantee (141 ) (91 ) (0.23 ) Impairment charge related to ACeS (117 ) (77 ) (0.19 ) Other portfolio shaping items (46 ) (30 ) (0.07 ) Gain on sale of Control Systems 302 180 0.45 Partial reversal of CalComp reserve 33 21 0.05 Gain on sales of surplus real estate 28 19 0.05 $ (685 ) $ (951 ) $ (2.36 ) Our operating profit for 2002 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 39% compared to 2001. Our operating profit for 2001 was $833 million, a decrease of 25% compared to 2000. These amounts included the impacts of unusual items which reduced operating profit for 2002, 2001 54 and 2000 by $1,112 million, $973 million and $685 million, respectively. The results for 2001 and 2000 included amortization expense of $274 million and $297 million, respectively, for goodwill and certain other intangibles that was not included in 2002 due to the adoption of FAS 142. Adjusting for the effects of the unusual items and the adoption of FAS 142 for each year, operating profit for 2002 would have been $2.3 billion, a 9% increase over the operating profit of $2.1 billion in 2001. The operating profit for 2001 would have remained comparable to operating profit of $2.1 billion in 2000. Operating profit in 2002 increased in all four business segments when compared to 2001. When comparing 2001 to 2000, increases in the Aeronautics, Space Systems and Technology Services segments were offset by a decrease in operating profit in Systems Integration. Interest expense for 2002 was $581 million, $119 million lower than the comparable amount in 2001 mainly due to reductions in our debt portfolio and the benefit from interest rate swap agreements. Interest expense for 2001 was $700 million, $219 million lower than the amount for 2000 mainly as a result of reductions in our debt portfolio. Our effective tax rate was 7.7% for 2002, 67.7% for 2001 and 355.7% for 2000. The rate for each year was affected by the tax impact from unusual items. Included in the unusual items for 2002 was a $90 million tax benefit related to the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim. In addition, for years prior to 2002, the rates were increased by non-deductible goodwill that was being amortized for financial accounting purposes. For 2000, the tax rate was further increased by write-offs of non-deductible goodwill for businesses divested in that year. Adjusting for the impact of unusual items and the adoption of FAS 142, our effective tax rates would have been 31% for 2002, 32.6% for 2001 and 36.2% for 2000. For 2002 and 2001 these adjusted effective tax rates were lower than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to the lower tax rates on extraterritorial income. For 2000, the adjusted rate was higher than the statutory rate due to adjustments for revisions to prior year estimates. For 2002, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $533 million ($1.18 per diluted share) compared to $43 million ($0.10 per diluted share) for 2001. In 2000, we reported a loss from continuing operations of $477 million ($1.19 per diluted share). These amounts included the after-tax effects of unusual items which reduced earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 by $632 million, $651 million and $951 million, respectively. The results for 2001 and 2000 included after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and $268 million, respectively, for goodwill and certain other intangibles that was not included in 2002 due to the adoption of FAS 142. Adjusting for the unusual items and the adoption of FAS 142, earnings from continuing operations would have been $1.2 billion in 2002, $930 million in 2001, and $742 million in 2000. Discontinued Operations We reported losses from discontinued operations of $33 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in 2002, $1.1 billion ($2.52 per diluted share) in 2001, and $42 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 2000. 55 The businesses included in discontinued operations reported operating losses of $33 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in 2002, $62 million ($0.14 per diluted share) in 2001, and $42 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 2000. Discontinued operations for 2002 includes losses incurred for wind-down activities related to the global telecommunications services businesses, offset by the reversal of a reserve associated with the sale of IMS. When recording the sale of IMS in 2001, we established transaction-related reserves to address various indemnity provisions in the sale agreement. The risks associated with certain of these indemnity provisions have been resolved and $39 million, net of taxes, was reversed through discontinued operations in 2002. Included in the 2001 loss from discontinued operations was an unusual after-tax charge of $1.3 billion ($3.09 per diluted share) related to our decision to exit the global telecommunications services business. The 2001 results also include an unusual after-tax gain of $309 million ($0.71 per diluted share) from the third quarter 2001 sale of Lockheed Martin IMS Corporation. Net Earnings (Loss) We reported net earnings of $500 million ($1.11 per diluted share) in 2002, compared to net losses of $1 billion ($2.42 per diluted share) in 2001 and $519 million ($1.29 per diluted share) in 2000. These amounts included the after-tax effects of unusual items which reduced earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 by $632 million, $1,678 million and $951 million, respectively. The results for 2001 and 2000 included after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and $268 million, respectively, for goodwill and certain other intangibles that was not included in 2002 due to the adoption of FAS 142. Discussion of Business Segments We changed the way we report the results of our business segments in the fourth quarter of 2002. The change in presentation is being made to align the way segment operating results are reported to senior management for their evaluation of segment operating performance. We continue to operate in four principal business segments: Systems Integration, Space Systems, Aeronautics and Technology Services. The changes include the following: · The Corporate and Other segment has been eliminated; 56 · Operating profit (loss) from the operations of the four principal business segments is reconciled to the reported consolidated results utilizing the following items: – Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net – this caption includes – · Unusual items (discussed under Results of Operations above) – The effects of unusual items that are not considered part of management’s evaluation of the segment’s operating results (e.g., sales of surplus real estate, impairment charges, divestitures and other portfolio shaping activities) are excluded from the business segment results; · The difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are reported in the business segment results, and pension expense or income determined in accordance with FAS 87 as reported in Note 13 to the financial statements (FAS/CAS adjustment). This amount was previously allocated to the business segments; · The costs of our common stock-based compensation plans, including our Long-Term Incentive Performance Award Program. This amount was also allocated to the business segments previously; · Corporate costs not allocated to the business segments and other miscellaneous Corporate activities, including interest income and earnings and losses from our equity investments. – Impact of adoption of FAS 142 (discussed under Results of Operations above) – The impact of goodwill no longer being amortized and the change in the estimated remaining useful life of the contract intangible asset related to the F-16 program is now excluded from segment results for all periods before January 1, 2002. For more information on the changes in our segment presentation and the reasons for the changes, see Note 16 to the financial statements. The following tables of financial information and the discussions of the results of operations of our business segments have been adjusted to reflect the new presentation of segment operating results and correspond to segment information presented in Note 16. 57 This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales Systems Integration $ 9,603 $ 9,014 $ 9,647 Space Systems 7,384 6,836 7,339 Aeronautics 6,471 5,355 4,885 Technology Services 3,104 2,763 2,649 Total business segments 26,562 23,968 24,520 Other 16 22 21 $ 26,578 $ 23,990 $ 24,541 Operating profit (loss) Systems Integration $ 952 $ 906 $ 981 Space Systems 443 360 345 Aeronautics 448 329 280 Technology Services 177 114 106 Total business segments 2,020 1,709 1,712 Unallocated Corporate expense, net (862 ) (602 ) (310 ) Impact of FAS 142 adoption — (274 ) (297 ) $ 1,158 $ 833 $ 1,105 The Space Systems and Aeronautics segments generally include fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the Systems Integration and Technology Services segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments. Systems Integration Systems Integration’s operating results included the following: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 9,603 $ 9,014 $ 9,647 Operating profit 952 906 981 Net sales for Systems Integration increased 7% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Sales increased as a result of higher volume in three of the segment’s four lines of business. Increased sales at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) of $285 million were mainly due to higher volumes on the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile program and on certain tactical missile programs. Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) sales increased by $275 million mainly as a result of volume on information superiority programs. Naval Electronics & Surveillance Systems (NE&SS) sales increased by $145 million primarily 58 due to higher volumes on surface systems and radar systems programs. These increases were partially offset by a $115 million decrease in sales related to volume declines on platform integration programs in the Systems Integration-Owego line of business. Net sales for the segment declined by 7% in 2001 compared to 2000. Sales would have increased 4% for 2001 compared to 2000 had the sales attributable to the segment’s Aerospace Electronic Systems (AES) and Control Systems businesses, which were divested in the second half of 2000, and the transfer of the Payload Launch Vehicle (PLV) contract to the Space Systems segment at the start of 2001, been excluded from the comparisons. Sales increased by $270 million as a result of volume increases in NE&SS, primarily on tactical systems and surface systems programs, and undersea and radar systems activities. M&FC sales increased by $235 million, mainly due to higher volume on certain tactical missile programs and the THAAD missile program. C4I sales increased slightly year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by a $275 million decrease in sales related to volume declines on platform integration programs at Systems Integration-Owego. Operating profit for the segment increased by 5% in 2002 compared to 2001. Increased operating profit of $60 million from the sales growth at M&FC, C4I and NE&SS more than offset lower operating profit of $14 million at Systems Integration-Owego. Overall, a decline in volume on mature production programs (at Owego and M&FC) and higher volume on development programs (at NE&SS and M&FC) contributed to the slight decline in margins. Operating profit for the segment decreased 8% in 2001 compared to 2000. Operating profit would have increased by 4% for 2001 from the previous year had the operating profit related to the divested AES and Control Systems businesses, as well as the PLV contract transfer, been excluded from the comparisons. Increased operating profit of $85 million from the sales growth at NE&SS, C4I, and M&FC more than offset the decrease resulting from the volume decline at Systems Integration-Owego. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 7,384 $ 6,836 $ 7,339 Operating profit 443 360 345 Net sales for Space Systems increased by 8% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $370 million and commercial space of $180 million. In government space, increases of $470 million in government satellite programs and $130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $175 million on government launch vehicles and $55 million on strategic missile programs. The increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities, with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001. Net sales for the segment decreased by 7% in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $560 million, which more than 59 offset increases in government space of $60 million. In commercial space, sales declined due to volume reductions of $480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $80 million in satellite programs. There were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000. The increase in government space resulted from a combined increase of $230 million related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities. These increases were partially offset by a $110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity, primarily due to program maturities, and by $50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the Titan IV program in 2000. Operating profit for the segment increased 23% in 2002 as compared to 2001, mainly driven by the commercial space business. Reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $90 million when compared to 2001. Commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased. In the first quarter of 2001, a $40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts. Due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market, financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging. During 2002, this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $55 million on the three additional launches in the current year, additional charges of $60 million (net of a favorable contract adjustment of $20 million) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs. The 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures, which reduced that year’s operating profit by $145 million. The $10 million decrease in government space’s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs, which combined to decrease operating profit by $80 million, partially offset by increases of $40 million in government satellite programs and $30 million in ground systems activities. Operating profit for the segment increased by 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. Operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $20 million in commercial space. In government space, operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs. The year-to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $50 million favorable Titan IV adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above, due to a $55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehicle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000. In commercial space, decreased operating profit of $15 million on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satellite manufacturing activities. The commercial launch vehicle operating results included $60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000. These negative adjustments were partially offset by $50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle contracts. Commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. 60 Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 6,471 $ 5,355 $ 4,885 Operating profit 448 329 280 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 21% in 2002 compared to 2001. The higher sales were primarily driven by volume increases of $860 million on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $475 million on F/A-22 production contracts and a combined increase of $340 million from higher volume on the F-16 and C-5 programs. These increases were partially offset by a $335 million decline resulting from seven fewer C-130J deliveries compared to 2001 and a $140 million decrease due to lower volume on F/A-22 Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) activities. Net sales for the segment increased by 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. During 2001, sales increased by $400 million primarily due to the initial ramp up on F/A-22 production contracts and increased volume on F-16 programs. Volume increases from F-16 and C-130 support activities also increased sales by $230 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in sales of $260 million resulting from fewer F-16 and C-130J deliveries in 2001. Operating profit for the segment increased by 36% in 2002 compared to 2001. Increased operating profit of $119 million primarily resulted from the higher volume on the programs noted in the discussion of sales. Operating profit for 2002 was negatively affected by a $15 million charge recorded in the third quarter for performance issues on an aircraft modification contract and by a $15 million change in estimate adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter related to cost growth on F/A-22 EMD activities. Margins in 2002 were favorably affected by having seven fewer C-130J deliveries in the year as compared to 2001. The C-130J deliveries do not impact operating profit due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program. Operating profit for the segment increased by 18% for 2001 compared to 2000. For the year, operating profit increased by $49 million due to increased volume and performance on the F/A-22 program, development activities on F-16 and other aeronautical programs. This increase was partially offset by a decline in F-16 deliveries. Margins in 2001 were favorably affected by having five fewer C-130J deliveries as compared to 2000. Technology Services Technology Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 3,104 $ 2,763 $ 2,649 Operating profit 177 114 106 61 Net sales for Technology Services increased by 12% in 2002 compared to 2001. For the year, the increase in sales was primarily attributable to growth of $335 million in the government information technology line of business, due to increased volume on existing programs and the acquisition of OAO Corporation effective December 1, 2001, and $155 million in the defense line of business. This growth was partially offset by a combined $160 million decline in sales related to volume on the commercial information technology and NASA lines of business. Net sales for the segment increased by 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the sales attributable to Lockheed Martin Energy Technologies and Retech, two business units that were divested in 2000, and the acquisition of OAO Corporation, sales would have increased 7% for the year. Sales increased $190 million primarily due to increased volume in the government information technology and military aircraft lines of business. This growth was partially offset by lower sales volume associated with the segment’s energy-related contracts due to program completions. Operating profit for the segment increased by 55% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase is mainly due to improved performance in commercial information technology and the higher volume in government information technology, which together, increased operating profit by $100 million. These increases were partially offset by a combined decrease in operating profit of $30 million on the military aircraft, NASA, defense and energy lines of business. Operating profit for the segment increased by 8% for 2001 compared to 2000. Operating profit increased by $30 million in 2001 from higher volumes in the government information technology and military aircraft lines of business. This improvement was partially offset by a $20 million reduction in operating profit due to the completion of energy-related contracts. The Technology Services segment has a business unit which provides services to the government of Argentina. At December 31, 2002, we had investments in and advances to the business unit totaling about $30 million. While we expect that these amounts will be recoverable, there is always the potential that further devaluation of the Argentine peso, deterioration in the Argentine economy or other factors could adversely affect our ability to recover those amounts. Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the components of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net Unusual items $ (1,112 ) $ (973 ) $ (685 ) FAS/CAS adjustment 243 360 309 Other 7 11 66 $ (862 ) $ (602 ) $ (310 ) For information about unusual items, see the table under the previous discussion of continuing operations. 62 The difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS and pension expense or income determined in accordance with FAS 87 is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit (FAS/CAS adjustment). The CAS funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments’ cost of goods sold. This cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing, and is consequently included in the segments’ sales. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS income, and the FAS/CAS adjustment: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 FAS 87 income $ 156 $ 354 $ 302 CAS funding and expense (87 ) (6 ) (7 ) FAS/CAS adjustment—income $ 243 $ 360 $ 309 Backlog Total negotiated backlog was $70.4 billion at December 31, 2002. This amount includes both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for our products for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer—Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Funded backlog was $36.1 billion at December 31, 2002. The following table shows total backlog by segment at the end of each of the last three years: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Backlog Systems Integration $ 17,671 $ 17,027 $ 16,706 Space Systems 12,620 12,977 15,505 Aeronautics 35,477 36,149 17,570 Technology Services 4,617 5,116 5,295 $ 70,385 $ 71,269 $ 55,076 63 Liquidity and Cash Flows Operating Activities Operating activities provided $2.3 billion of cash in 2002, compared to $1.8 billion in 2001 and $2.0 billion in 2000. Operating activities included earnings (loss) from continuing operations, as adjusted for noncash items, and the cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Management of our working capital accounts (accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and customer advances) contributed $202 million of cash flow in 2002, $1.1 billion in 2001 and $355 million in 2000. The timing of income tax payments or refunds also affects our operating cash flows. In 2002, we received $117 million from the settlement of the R&D tax credit claim while in 2001, we paid $655 million of income taxes related to divested businesses. Included in operating activities is cash provided from discontinued operations of $25 million in 2002, $34 million in 2001 and $25 million in 2000. Operating cash flows were sufficient to operate our businesses, finance capital expenditures and to pay dividends on our common stock each year. Investing Activities Investing activities used $539 million of cash in 2002, compared to providing $139 million in 2001 and $1.8 billion in 2000. Cash used for property, plant and equipment expenditures increased 7% in 2002 and 24% in 2001 and included $10 million in 2002, $74 million in 2001 and $58 million in 2000 for the discontinued businesses. During 2002, we received proceeds of $134 million from the sale of our discontinued telecommunications businesses and $93 million primarily from the disposal of property, plant and equipment. Investments of $104 million were made in 2002, primarily related to our acquisition of OAO Corporation. During 2001, we received proceeds of $825 million from the sale of our IMS business. Investments in affiliated companies of $192 million primarily consisted of $140 million to complete our funding commitment to Astrolink and $30 million to Intelsat. The remainder of the 2001 activity was attributable to proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, and various other investing activities. During 2000, we received $1.7 billion from the sale of our AES business, $510 million from the sale of our Control Systems business and $164 million from the sale of a portion of our investment in Inmarsat. Investments in affiliated companies of $257 million mainly consisted of our funding commitment to Astrolink of $127 million and an additional investment in Intelsat of $58 million. Proceeds from the sale of property and other activities contributed $175 million to our investing activities. 64 Financing Activities Financing activities provided $77 million of cash in 2002, as compared to using $2.6 billion in 2001 and $2.7 billion in 2000. Proceeds of $436 million from stock option activity more than offset dividend payments of $199 million, repayment of debt (primarily ESOP obligations) of $110 million and $50 million for the repurchase of 1 million shares of common stock in 2002. Including the $450 million of debentures we called in 2003 to be repaid early and the $150 million of debt we recorded relating to our guarantee of Space Imaging, LLC’s existing credit facility (see the related discussions under Capital Structure and Resources), debt maturities will amount to $1,365 million in 2003. During 2001, improved operating cash flows and cash provided by investing activities allowed us to reduce our long-term debt by approximately $2.4 billion. The reduction in long-term debt was primarily attributable to the pre-payment of notes issued to a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company (GE), payments on scheduled debt maturities, and the early retirement of certain other debt instruments. Debt retirements in 2000 were mainly attributable to our completing tender offers for some of our long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2000. We used $2.1 billion to consummate the tender offers, resulting in the early repayment of $1.9 billion in long-term debt and an unusual loss, net of state income tax benefits, of $146 million, or $95 million after tax. We paid dividends of $199 million in 2002, $192 million in 2001 and $183 million in 2000. Other We receive advances on some contracts to finance inventories. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately $4.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in advances, performance-based payments and progress payments for work in process were received from customers and recorded as a reduction to inventories in our balance sheet. Also at December 31, 2002 and 2001, $466 million and $566 million, respectively, of customer advances, performance-based payments and progress payments were recorded in receivables as a reduction to unbilled costs and accrued profits. Approximately $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion of customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, which are usually from foreign governments and commercial customers, were included in current liabilities at the end of 2002 and 2001, respectively (see Note 1). Capital Structure and Resources Total debt increased by $71 million during 2002 from a balance of $7.5 billion at December 31, 2001. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2002 included $450 million of debentures we called in 2003 to be repaid early and $150 million of debt we recorded relating to our guarantee of Space Imaging, LLC’s existing credit facility (see the related discussions below). Our long-term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued, fixed-rate notes and debentures. At December 31, 2002, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, some of which will be used to meet scheduled long-term debt maturities in 2003. 65 Total stockholders’ equity was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $578 million from December 31, 2001. This decrease was mainly attributable to our recognition of an additional minimum pension liability, which reduced stockholders’ equity on an after-tax basis by $1.5 billion, the payment of dividends of $199 million and the repurchase of 1 million shares of common stock for $50 million. Stock option and ESOP activity of $752 million and net earnings of $500 million during the year partially offset the decline. As a result of the above factors, our total debt-to-capitalization ratio increased from 53.8% at December 31, 2001 to 56.4% at December 31, 2002. In 2003, in order to reduce interest expense and improve our debt-to-capitalization ratio, we decided to issue irrevocable redemption notices to the trustees for two issuances of callable debentures totaling $450 million. These debentures have interest rates that are higher than current market rates. One notice was for $300 million of 7.875% debentures due on March 15, 2023, which were callable on or after March 15, 2003. The second was for $150 million of 7.75% debentures due on April 15, 2023, which were callable on or after April 15, 2003. We expect to repay amounts due on March 15, 2003 and April 15, 2003, respectively. Therefore, we have included the $450 million in current maturities of long-term debt on our balance sheet at December 31, 2002. We expect to incur a loss on the early repayment of the debt, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $16 million, or $10 million after tax. At the end of 2002, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility; no borrowings were outstanding. This credit facility will expire in November 2006. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate (as defined). Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. In October 2002, we terminated our $1.0 billion 1-year credit facility. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. Periodically, we may refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents (including temporary investments), internally generated cash flow from operations and other available financing resources, including those described above, are 66 expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as discretionary investment needs, during the next twelve months. Consistent with our desire to generate cash to reduce debt and invest in our core businesses, we expect that, subject to prevailing financial, market and economic conditions, we will continue to explore the sale of non-core businesses, passive equity investments and surplus real estate. At December 31, 2002, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), and to make payments under operating leases. Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less than1 Year 1–3Years 4–5Years After 5 Years Long-term debt and capital lease obligations(a) $ 7,557 $ 1,365 $ 156 $ 816 $ 5,220 Operating lease commitments(b) 1,042 222 356 236 228 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,599 $ 1,587 $ 512 $ 1,052 $ 5,448 (a) Amounts exclude a $25 million adjustment to the fair value of long-term debt relating to the Corporation’s interest rate swap agreements which will not be settled in cash. (b) Includes future payments related to a leasing arrangement with a state government authority for Atlas V launch facilities. Total payments under the arrangement are expected to be approximately $320 million over a 10-year period. Lease payments began in August 2002. We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts to provide products and services to customers. At December 31, 2002, we had contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and other arrangements, as follows: Commitment Expiration per Period (In millions) Total Commitment Less than 1 Year 1–3Years 4–5Years After 5Years Surety bonds(a) $ 291 $ 117 $ 74 $ 100 $ — Standby letters of credit(a) 288 200 73 4 11 Guarantees 3 2 1 — — Total commitments $ 582 $ 319 $ 148 $ 104 $ 11 (a) Approximately $100 million and $5 million of surety bonds in the “less than 1 year” and “1–3 year” periods, respectively, and approximately $143 million and $4 million of standby letters of credit in the “less than 1 year” and “1–3 year” periods, respectively, are expected to automatically renew for additional one-to-two year periods until completion of the contractual obligation. We have issued standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $4.1 billion related to advances received from customers and/or to secure our performance under long-term contracts. Amounts included in the table above totaling $579 million are those amounts over and above 67 advances received from customers which are recorded in the balance sheet as either offsets against inventories or in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. Of the $3.5 billion recorded in the balance sheet, approximately $2 billion relates to a standby letter of credit to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. This letter of credit is available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance. Similar to the letter of credit for the F-16 contract, letters of credit and surety bonds for other contracts are available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance. We hold a 46% interest in a joint venture called Space Imaging, LLC (Space Imaging) which we account for under the equity method. Space Imaging was recently successful in obtaining certain long-term commitments from the U.S. Government for purchases of commercial satellite imagery on an as needed basis. However, to execute its current business plans and fund future replacement satellites, Space Imaging will likely need, but has not been able to obtain commitments for, additional investment or funding. In addition to our equity investment, we also guarantee up to $150 million of Space Imaging’s borrowings under a credit facility that matures on March 31, 2003, and have about $33 million in receivables from the joint venture at the end of 2002. In light of our decision and the decision of the other major member in the joint venture not to provide further funding at this time, our assessment that Space Imaging will likely not be able to repay its obligation under the credit facility when due, and the uncertainties as to whether Space Imaging will be successful in obtaining the additional investment necessary to fund replacement satellites, we wrote off our investment in the joint venture and recorded the obligation to fund amounts due from us under the guarantee. As a result, we recorded a charge, net of state income taxes, of $163 million which reduced net earnings by $106 million ($0.23 per diluted share), and increased current maturities of long-term debt by $150 million, representing our obligation under the guarantee, which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2003. In March 2000, we converted our 45.9 million shares of Loral Space & Communications Ltd. Series A Preferred Stock into an equal number of shares of Loral Space common stock. Due to the market price of Loral Space stock and the potential impact of underlying market and industry conditions on Loral Space’s ability to execute its current business plans, we recorded an unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $361 million in the third quarter of 2001 related to our investment in Loral Space. The charge reduced net earnings by $235 million, or $0.54 per diluted share (see Note 8 to the financial statements). The value of our investment continues to be impacted by adverse market and industry conditions, including low demand for commercial satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. We satisfied our contractual obligation relating to our guarantee of certain indebtedness of Globalstar, L.P. (Globalstar) with a net payment of $150 million on June 30, 2000 to repay a portion of Globalstar’s borrowings under a revolving credit agreement. This payment resulted in our recording an unusual charge, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $141 million in 2000 which reduced net earnings for the year by $91 million, or $0.23 per diluted share (see Note 9 to the financial statements for more information). We have no remaining guarantees related to Globalstar. On February 15, 2002, Globalstar and certain of its affiliates filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 68 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk mainly include commercial paper and fixed-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2002, we did not have any commercial paper outstanding. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. At the end of the year 2002, we had agreements in place to swap fixed interest rates on about $920 million of our long-term debt for variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges of the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2002, the fair values of interest rate swap agreements outstanding totaled about $25 million. The amounts of gains and losses from changes in the fair values of the swap agreements were entirely offset by those from changes in the fair value of the associated debt obligations. The interest rate swaps create a market exposure to changes in the LIBOR rate. To the extent that the LIBOR index on which the swaps are based increases or decreases by 1%, our interest expense would increase or decrease by $9 million annually on a pretax basis. Changes in swap rates would affect the market value of the agreements, but those changes in value would be offset by changes in value of the underlying debt. A 1% rise in swap rates from those at December 31, 2002 would result in a decrease in market value of about $11 million. A 1% decline would increase the market value by a like amount. We use forward foreign exchange and option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of the cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions, and related gains and losses on the contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized currently. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of forward exchange and option contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year, were not material. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Environmental Matters As more fully described in Note 15 to the financial statements, we have property that is subject to environmental matters. In our opinion, the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Certain expenditures related to the recorded liabilities discussed below, after deducting any recoveries from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing the prices of our products and services under contracts with the U.S. Government. The recorded amounts do not reflect the possible future recoveries of portions of the environmental costs through insurance policy coverage or from other PRPs, which we are pursuing as required by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. These matters include the following items: We are responding to three administrative orders issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board in connection with our former facilities in Redlands, California. We are also coordinating with the U.S. Air Force, which is working with the aerospace and defense industry to conduct preliminary studies of the potential health effects of perchlorate exposure associated with several sites across the country, including the Redlands site. The results of these 69 studies are intended to assist us in determining our ultimate clean-up obligation, if any, with respect to perchlorates. In January 2002, the State of California reduced the provisional standard for perchlorate concentration in water from 18 parts per billion (ppb) to 4 ppb. Although this provisional standard does not create a legally enforceable requirement for us at this time, we have developed a preliminary remediation plan that would meet the provisional standard if it were to become final. Because this plan entails a long lead-time to be implemented, we have decided to begin implementing the plan and recognize the increased costs that are associated with the plan. The balance sheet at December 31, 2002 includes a liability of approximately $185 million which is our estimate of the remaining expenditures necessary to implement the remediation and other work at the site over the next 30 years. This amount is approximately $100 million more than the amount recorded at December 31, 2001. As at other sites, we are pursuing claims against other potentially responsible parties (PRPs), including the U.S. Government, to help with clean-up costs. We have also been conducting remediation activities to address soil and groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents at our former operations in Great Neck, New York. Until the third quarter of 2002, all of the remediation work associated with this site had been performed on the site itself. In the third quarter, we entered into negotiations with the State of New York to implement an off-site interim remedial measure intended to address an off-site plume of groundwater contamination that was found to be moving more rapidly than originally anticipated. This has led to an increase of approximately $50 million in the projected future costs for the site. Total projected future costs are now estimated to be about $70 million through 2025. This amount is included in our balance sheet at December 31, 2002. As at other sites, we are pursuing claims against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, to help with clean-up costs. Since 1990, we have been responding to various consent decrees and orders relating to soil and regional groundwater contamination in the San Fernando Valley associated with our former operations in Burbank and Glendale, California. Under an agreement reached with the U.S. Government in 2000, we will continue to be reimbursed in an amount equal to about 50% of future expenditures for certain remediation activities by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We have recorded a liability of approximately $60 million representing our estimate of the total expenditures required over the remaining terms of the consent decrees and orders for the Glendale and Burbank sites, net of the effects of the agreement. We are a party to other proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental clean-up issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a PRP by the EPA or by a state agency. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual burden for the costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean-up and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, however, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. 70 In addition to the amounts related to the Redlands, Burbank, Glendale and Great Neck sites described above, a liability of approximately $130 million for the other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) in which an estimate of financial exposure can be determined has been recorded. We believe that it is unlikely that any additional liability we may have for known environmental issues would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. As described in Note 15 to the financial statements, we are continuing to pursue recovery of a significant portion of the unanticipated costs we incurred for a $180 million fixed-price contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for the remediation of waste found in Pit 9. We have been unsuccessful to date in reaching agreement with the DoE on cost recovery or other contract restructuring matters. In 1998, the management contractor for the project, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, at the DoE’s direction, terminated the Pit 9 contract for default. We sued the DoE in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking to overturn the default termination and to recover our costs. The management contractor, at the DoE’s direction, sued us in the U.S. District Court in Idaho seeking, among other things, recovery of about $54 million previously paid to us under the contract. We filed counterclaims, again seeking to overturn the default termination and recover our costs. In 2001, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed our lawsuit against the DoE, finding that we lacked privity of contract with the DoE. On September 30, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal. We did not appeal the decision further and will continue to seek resolution of the Pit 9 dispute through non-litigation means while pursuing our remedies in the Idaho proceeding, which is set for trial in August 2003. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost to benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. Within 90 days prior to the date of this report, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on the evaluation, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls after the date we completed the evaluation. 71 ITEM 7A.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2018,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewWe are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2017, 69% of our $51.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 58% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 30% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space, previously known as Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.2018 Financial TrendsEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted two new accounting standards. Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (commonly referred to as ASC 606) changes the way we recognize revenue from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) changes the income statement presentation of certain components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the adoption of these standards.24Table of ContentsThe following table presents selected 2017 recast, unaudited financial data updated for the adoption of ASC 606 and ASU 2017-07 (in millions). We are providing this information to assist in understanding our 2018 trend information in the following paragraphs, which includes the impacts of adopting these standards. Year Ended December 31, 2017 Historical Adjustments for ASC 606 Adjustments for ASU 2017-07 AdjustedNet sales (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited)Aeronautics $20,148 $(738) $— $19,410Missiles and Fire Control 7,212 82 — 7,294Rotary and Mission Systems 14,215 (552) — 13,663Space 9,473 136 — 9,609Total net sales $51,048 $(1,072) $— $49,976Operating profit Aeronautics $2,164 $12 $— $2,176Missiles and Fire Control 1,053 (4) — 1,049Rotary and Mission Systems 905 (3) — 902Space 993 (13) — 980Total business segment operating profit 5,115 (8) — 5,107Total unallocated, net (a) 806 — 846 1,652Total consolidated operating profit (a) $5,921 $(8) $846 $6,759(a) Total unallocated, net and consolidated operating profit includes an increase of $846 million in 2017, with a corresponding increase in other non-operating expense, net for the expected impact of adopting ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) on January 1, 2018. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.We expect 2018 net sales will increase in the low-single digit range from 2017 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and sustainment volume on the F-35 program at Aeronautics as well as increased volume in tactical missiles programs at MFC, partially offset by decreased volume at RMS and Space. Segment operating profit is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2017 levels primarily driven by improved performance at RMS. Accordingly, we expect that 2018 segment operating profit margin will slightly increase over our 2017 margin of 10.2%. Our outlook for 2018 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2018 budget. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2018 net sales and operating profit margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below.We expect the net 2018 FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $1.0 billion assuming a 3.625% discount rate (a 50 basis point decrease from the end of 2016), an approximately 13.00% return on plan assets in 2017 (a 550 basis point increase from the expected rate of return at the end of 2016), and a 7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, and the revised longevity assumptions released on October 20, 2017 by the Society of Actuaries. We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until 2021. We plan to fund these contributions using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow us to issue new debt if circumstances change (see “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below). As a result of adopting ASU No. 2017-07, we expect to present a reclassification of non-service FAS net periodic benefit costs for all postretirement benefit plans (including the qualified defined benefit pension plans) of approximately $870 million for the fiscal year 2018 from consolidated operating profit to other non-operating income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. This reclassification has no impact on our total business segment operating profit or consolidated net earnings.Business Segment 2018 Financial TrendsAeronauticsWe expect Aeronautics’ 2018 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2017 driven by increased production and sustainment volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit percentage range, resulting in slightly lower operating profit margins.25Table of ContentsMissiles and Fire ControlWe expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2018 as compared to 2017 driven primarily by key contract awards and volume in tactical missile programs. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit percentage range in 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to new development volume associated with recent key contract awards. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to slightly decrease from 2017 levels.Rotary and Mission SystemsWe expect RMS’ net sales to decrease in the low-single digit percentage range as compared to 2017 driven primarily by lower volume in our Sikorsky business partially offset by higher volume in our training and logistics services and integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) lines of business. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low double digit percentage range driven by performance improvements in the IWSS and C4ISR and Undersea Systems and Sensors (C4USS) lines of business. Operating profit margins are also expected to improve from 2017 levels.SpaceWe expect Space's 2018 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit percentage range compared to 2017, driven by lower volume resulting from program lifecycles on government satellite programs and lower cost on follow-on contracts. Operating profit in 2018 is expected to be comparable to 2017. As a result operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly from 2017 levels.Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business On August 16, 2016, we divested our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS business to Abacus Innovations Corporation (Abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common stock of Abacus was distributed to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed Martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of Abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of Abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of the Transaction and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. The net gain represents the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired 26Table of Contentsas part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital.We classified the operating results of our former IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash flows generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the Transaction.Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft CorporationOn November 6, 2015, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2015 by and between us and United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of UTC, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and certain affiliated companies (collectively “Sikorsky”) for $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. Sikorsky, a global company primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, service and support of military and commercial helicopters, has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, aligned under the RMS business segment. We funded the acquisition with new debt issuances, commercial paper and cash on hand. We and UTC made a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, which treats the transaction as an asset purchase for tax purposes. This election generates a cash tax benefit for us and our stockholders. The 2015 financial results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s operations. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the debt we incurred in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition.Other On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. At which time, we began consolidating AWE. Consequently, our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit.For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Industry ConsiderationsU.S. Government Funding The U.S. Government has not yet passed an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 (the U.S. Government’s fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30). However, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government passed a continuing resolution funding measure to finance all U.S. Government activities through January 19, 2018. Congress was unable to reach an agreement to continue to fund the government prior to midnight on January 19, 2018, and the U.S. Government was forced to shut down for three days. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. Government passed a continuing resolution funding measure to finance all U.S. Government activities through February 8, 2018. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for fiscal year 2017 are available, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed, we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our results of operations. In May 2017, the President submitted a budget proposal for GFY 2018 to Congress, which includes a base budget for the DoD of $575 billion, approximately $52 billion above the spending limits established under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the Budget Control Act) (described below) and an increase of $32 billion over the fiscal year 2017 funding level. The President’s budget requests also includes funding of $65 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) / Global War on Terror (GWOT), which is not subject to the Budget Control Act spending limits. Congress must approve or revise the President’s GFY 2018 budget proposals through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final Presidential approval. 27Table of ContentsIn December, the President signed the GFY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. The NDAA authorizes funding levels for the agencies responsible for defense and sets forth how the funds will be used. The NDAA authorizes $626 billion in base defense spending ($606 billion for DoD) and $66 billion in OCO funds, exceeding the Budget Control Act limits for base defense spending by $85 billion. The OCO account is exempt from the Budget Control Act. It remains uncertain when an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 will be enacted or at what levels.Currently, U.S. defense spending through fiscal year 2021 remains subject to statutory spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. The spending limits were modified for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. However, these acts did not provide relief to the spending limits beyond fiscal year 2017. If Congress approves the President’s budget proposal or other appropriation legislation with funding levels that exceed the spending limits, automatic across-the-board spending reductions, known as sequestration, would be triggered to reduce funding back to the spending limits. As currently enacted, the Budget Control Act limits defense spending to $549 billion (approximately $522 billion for DoD) for fiscal year 2018 with modest increases of about 2.5% per year through 2021. The President’s budget proposal as well as defense budget estimates for fiscal year 2018 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified. The investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. However, the possibility remains that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S. Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, the implementation of sequestration (particularly in those circumstances where sequestration is implemented across-the-board without regard to national priorities), or other budget cuts in lieu of sequestration. On September 8, 2017, Congress passed legislation suspending the debt ceiling through December 8, 2017. On December 9, 2017, the debt limit was increased to the amount of debt the U.S. Government held outstanding on that date. However, despite using cash on hand and measures employed by the Department of Treasury, the debt ceiling is expected to be reached again in early 2018. Congress will need to raise the debt limit for the U.S. Government to continue borrowing money before these measures are exhausted. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. Government may not be able to pay for expenditures or fulfill its funding obligations and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary programs. We anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over defense spending and the debt ceiling. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that existing cuts to government programs could be kept in place, replaced with different spending cuts, and/or replaced with a package of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products and services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources.International BusinessA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers.International customers accounted for 36% of Aeronautics’ 2017 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and three international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. Through 2017, $8.2 billion of funding was awarded for the F-35 program under Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 11 contract for aircraft currently in production. This award is for international F-35 partners and FMS customers. Additionally in 2017, F‑35 aircraft deliveries continued from the Final Assembly and Check-Out (FACO) facility in Italy and were initiated at the Japan FACO facility. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the C-130J and F-16 programs. During 2017, six C-130J aircraft were delivered to India. In November 2017, the U.S. and Bahrain signed a government-to-government agreement, or a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), regarding the sale of new production Block 70 aircraft for the Royal Bahraini Air Force. We are transitioning F-16 production to Greenville, South Carolina, to support the Bahrain production program and other emerging F-16 production requirements.In 2017, international customers accounted for 34% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. We have ongoing PAC-3 programs for sustainment activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Additionally during 2017, we received an order for PAC-3 systems from Japan. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. UAE is an international 28Table of Contentscustomer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who took formal steps in October 2017 to begin the purchase of THAAD. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, including in Poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Other MFC international customers include the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Kuwait, and Bahrain.In 2017, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing programs in Canada and Chile for combat systems equipment upgrades on Halifax-class and Type 23 frigates. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. In addition, Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the RMS business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70i Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and VIP customers in over 30 countries.International customers accounted for 14% of Space’s 2017 net sales. Our Space business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space has international contracts with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform.Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of development contracts, production contracts and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. The System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion of the development contracts was substantially completed in 2017, with over 99% of flight test objectives met through over 9,200 flights. Approximately 70 flights remain and are expected to be completed in early 2018. Additionally, the final logistics and training capability is planned for 2018 and new Third Life structural testing added to the SDD portion in 2013 is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. Operationally, the U.S. Government continues to complete various tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations and weapons testing, and the F-35 aircraft fleet recently surpassed 118,000 flight hours. Progress also continues on the production of aircraft. In January 2017, the program achieved a major milestone when the U.S. Navy received its first F‑35C carrier variant at NAS Lemoore, California, as we continue to advance towards the U.S. Navy declaring the F‑35C carrier variant ready for combat. The U.S. Marine Corps completed the deployment of 16 F-35B variants now permanently assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. In June 2017, the first Japanese assembled F‑35A variant was unveiled at the FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan. This aircraft, delivered in September 2017, marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location. Similarly, in May 2017, the first F‑35B variant to be assembled outside the U.S. was rolled out at the Italian FACO facility, which has already delivered multiple F‑35A variants and is slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total. As of December 31, 2017, we have delivered 266 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners, and we have 235 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the aircraft. Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented 29Table of Contentson a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2017 2016 2015Net sales $51,048 $47,248 $40,536Cost of sales (45,500) (42,186) (36,044)Gross profit 5,548 5,062 4,492Other income, net 373 487 220Operating profit (a) 5,921 5,549 4,712Interest expense (651) (663) (443)Other non-operating (expense) income, net (1) — 30Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 5,269 4,886 4,299Income tax expense (b) (3,340) (1,133) (1,173)Net earnings from continuing operations 1,929 3,753 3,126Net earnings from discontinued operations 73 1,549 479Net earnings $2,002 $5,302 $3,605Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $6.64 $12.38 $9.93Discontinued operations 0.25 5.11 1.53Total diluted earnings per common share $6.89 $17.49 $11.46(a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 (see “Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) and a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC venture (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of AWE of approximately $104 million (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating profit includes $45 million of operating loss at Sikorsky, which is less than 1% of consolidated operating profit in 2015. Sikorsky’s operating loss is net of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015 (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).(b) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion ($6.69 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations. Net SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Products $43,875 $40,365 $34,868 % of total net sales 85.9% 85.4% 86.0%Services 7,173 6,883 5,668 % of total net sales 14.1% 14.6% 14.0%Total net sales $51,048 $47,248 $40,536 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment 30Table of Contentsresults of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method. Product Sales Product sales increased $3.5 billion, or 9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $2.1 billion at Aeronautics, $680 million at RMS and $425 million at MFC. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the F-35 program due to increased production volume, higher sales for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries and aircraft configuration mix and higher volume on aircraft modernization for the F-16 program, partially offset by lower sales for the C-5 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries. The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition of Sikorsky and higher volume on training and logistics services programs. Higher product sales at MFC were primarily due to higher sales for tactical missile programs due to product configuration mix and increased deliveries (primarily Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)), higher sales for air and missile defense systems due to contract mix (primarily PAC-3), higher volume on certain programs (primarily THAAD), and increased deliveries for fire control programs (primarily Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SNIPER®).Product sales increased $5.5 billion, or 16%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $3.7 billion at RMS and approximately $1.8 billion at Aeronautics. The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales for training and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and the C-130 program due to increased aircraft deliveries.Service SalesService sales increased $290 million, or 4%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $245 million at Aeronautics and $180 million at MFC, partially offset by lower service sales of about $210 million at Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs). Higher service sales at MFC were primarily attributable to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily PAC-3 and Hellfire). The decrease in service sales at Space was primarily due to lower space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events, partially offset by increased volume on government satellite services.Service sales increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $700 million at RMS and approximately $360 million at Aeronautics. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs).Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Cost of sales – products $(39,750) $(36,616) $(31,091) % of product sales 90.6% 90.7% 89.2%Cost of sales – services (6,405) (6,040) (4,824) % of service sales 89.3% 87.8% 85.1%Severance charges — (80) (82) Other unallocated, net 655 550 (47) Total cost of sales $(45,500) $(42,186) $(36,044) Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales 31Table of Contentsfor products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product CostsProduct costs increased approximately $3.1 billion, or 9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.8 billion at Aeronautics, $665 million at RMS and $420 million at MFC. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on aircraft production for the F-35 program and higher cost for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries and aircraft configuration mix and higher cost on aircraft modernization for the F-16 program, partially offset by lower cost for the C-5 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries. Higher product costs at RMS were primarily due to higher volume on certain helicopter programs, a net increase in charges for C4USS programs for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract and higher cost for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily attributable to higher cost for air and missile defense systems due to higher volume (primarily THAAD) and contract mix (primarily PAC-3), higher cost for tactical missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily JASSM) and increased deliveries for fire control programs (primarily LANTIRN® and SNIPER®).Product costs increased approximately $5.5 billion, or 18%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $3.6 billion at RMS and about $1.6 billion at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to product costs generated by Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased volume on aircraft production for the F-35 program and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-130 program. Service CostsService costs increased approximately $365 million, or 6%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $265 million at Aeronautics, $150 million at MFC and $110 million at RMS. This increase was partially offset by lower service costs of about $160 million at Space. Higher service cost at Aeronautics were primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs) and higher cost for the C-130 program due to timing of expenses for sustainment programs. Higher service costs at MFC were primarily attributable to higher sustainment activities (primarily PAC-3 and Hellfire). The increase in service costs at RMS was primarily attributable to higher Sikorsky sustainment activities for international programs. Lower service costs at Space were primarily due to lower space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events, partially offset by increased volume on government satellite services.Service costs increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 25%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased service costs of about $670 million at RMS and approximately $400 million at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to service costs generated by Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and the F-22 programs).Restructuring Charges2016 ActionsDuring 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions. 2015 ActionsDuring 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. As of December 31, 2016, we substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions. In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016 related to these actions. 32Table of ContentsWe have recovered a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations.Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $655 million and $550 million in 2017 and 2016, compared to a net increase to expense of $47 million in 2015. The increase in net reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016 from the former IS&GS business to other unallocated, net, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about costs reclassified to other unallocated, net. Additionally, the fluctuation between each respective period was also impacted by the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $876 million in 2017, $902 million in 2016 and $400 million in 2015, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The decrease in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in FAS pension expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; mostly offset by the increase in U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. The increase in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the increase in U.S. Government CAS pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost.Other Income, NetOther income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. Other income, net in 2017 was $373 million, compared to $487 million in 2016 and $220 million in 2015. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AAMROC). These decreases were partially offset by the recognition in the fourth quarter of 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of AWE. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily attributable to the non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in AWE and approximately $120 million of increased earnings generated by equity method investees as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Additionally, in 2015 we incurred a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business. Interest ExpenseInterest expense in 2017 was $651 million, compared to $663 million in 2016 and $443 million in 2015. The decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. The increase in interest expense in 2016 resulted from the debt we incurred to fund the acquisition of Sikorsky, and the issuance of notes in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt. Other Non-Operating (Expense) Income, NetOther non-operating (expense) income, net in 2017 was comparable to 2016. Other non-operating income, net decreased $30 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015, which did not recur in 2016. Income Tax ExpenseOn December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by $1.9 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act. We recorded a 33Table of Contentscorresponding net one-time charge of $1.9 billion ($6.69 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the Tax Act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.8 billion), a deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017. While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions and related accounting policy decisions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 63.4% for 2017, 23.2% for 2016, and 27.3% for 2015. The net one-time charge related to the Tax Act increased our 2017 effective income tax rate by 36.9 percentage points. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the Tax Act. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The U.S. manufacturing benefit was insignificant for 2017, compared to a reduction of our effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points for 2016 and 2.9 percentage points for 2015. The 2017 benefit was reduced by $81 million because of our 2017 decision after enactment of the Tax Act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit pension plans. The R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016, and 1.6 percentage points in 2015. The rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE. In addition, the rate for 2017 and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $106 million and $152 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 2.0 percentage points and 3.1 percentage points. As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business in 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2015.Future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.9 billion ($6.64 per share) in 2017, $3.8 billion ($12.38 per share) in 2016 and $3.1 billion ($9.93 per share) in 2015. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately five million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. From December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 14 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases and the completion of the exchange offer, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations We reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the IS&GS business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017, $1.5 billion ($5.11 per share) in 2016 and $479 million ($1.53 per share) in 2015. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business.34Table of ContentsNet EarningsWe reported net earnings of $2.0 billion ($6.89 per share) in 2017, $5.3 billion ($17.49 per share) in 2016 and $3.6 billion ($11.46 per share) in 2015. Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for all years presented. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); gains or losses from significant divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP, which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2017, 2016 and 2015, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension adjustment.35Table of ContentsSummary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015Net sales Aeronautics $20,148 $17,769 $15,570Missiles and Fire Control 7,212 6,608 6,770Rotary and Mission Systems 14,215 13,462 9,091Space 9,473 9,409 9,105Total net sales $51,048 $47,248 $40,536Operating profit Aeronautics $2,164 $1,887 $1,681Missiles and Fire Control 1,053 1,018 1,282Rotary and Mission Systems 905 906 844Space (a) 993 1,289 1,171Total business segment operating profit 5,115 5,100 4,978Unallocated items FAS/CAS pension adjustment FAS pension expense (b)(c) (1,372) (1,019) (1,127)Less: CAS pension cost (b)(c) 2,248 1,921 1,527FAS/CAS pension adjustment (d) 876 902 400Severance charges (b)(e) — (80) (82)Stock-based compensation (158) (149) (133)Other, net (f)(g) 88 (224) (451)Total unallocated, net 806 449 (266)Total consolidated operating profit $5,921 $5,549 $4,712(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million at our Space business segment, which increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million ($0.34 per share) in 2016. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).(b) FAS pension expense, CAS pension costs and severance charges reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees (see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). (c) The higher FAS expense in 2017 is primarily due to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2017 versus 2016. The higher CAS pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization (see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).(d) We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2018 of about $1.0 billion (see “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below).(e) See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (f) Other, net in 2017 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations (see “Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) and a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).(g) Other, net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million. Additionally other, net in 2015 includes approximately $38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky.The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $99.9 billion, $96.2 billion and $94.8 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $73.6 billion at December 31, 2017.36Table of ContentsManagement evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. 37Table of ContentsAs previously disclosed, we have a program to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense C4I systems for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program, EADGE-T, as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our RMS business segment. As of December 31, 2017, cumulative losses, including reserves, remained at approximately $260 million on this program. We are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available options and could record additional charges in future periods. However, based on the reserves already accrued and our current estimate of the costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional charges, if any, would be material. We have two commercial satellite programs at our Space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These commercial programs require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $305 million as of December 31, 2017, including approximately $135 million ($83 million or $0.29 per share, after tax) recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur unrecovered costs each period until we complete these programs and may have to record additional loss reserves in future periods, which could be material to our operating results. While we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserves, the programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional reserves. We do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contracts and have informed the customers. The customers could seek to exercise a termination right under the contracts, in which case we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay certain penalties. However, we think the probability that the customers will seek to exercise any termination right is remote as the delay beyond the termination date is modest and the customers have an immediate need for the satellites.Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.5 billion in both 2017 and 2016 and $1.7 billion in 2015. The consolidated net adjustments in 2017 were comparable to 2016, with increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics and Space business segments, offset by decreases at our MFC and RMS business segments. The decrease in our consolidated net adjustments in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our MFC and Space business segments, partially offset by an increase at our RMS business segment. The consolidated net adjustments for 2017 are inclusive of approximately $790 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract, Vertical Launching System (VLS) program and other programs at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $530 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2015 are inclusive of approximately $550 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space.Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $20,148 $17,769 $15,570 Operating profit 2,164 1,887 1,681 Operating margin 10.7% 10.6% 10.8%Backlog at year-end $35,832 $34,182 $31,842 2017 compared to 2016 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2017 increased $2.4 billion, or 13%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $2.0 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $260 million for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries (26 aircraft delivered in 2017 compared to 24 in 2016) and due to aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by lower volume for sustainment programs; and about $55 million for the F-16 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs, partially offset by lower deliveries (eight aircraft delivered in 2017 38Table of Contentscompared to 12 in 2016). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $155 million for the C-5 program due to lower deliveries (seven aircraft delivered in 2017 compared to nine in 2016).Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2017 increased $277 million, or 15%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased approximately $290 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the F-16 program due to higher risk retirements and higher volume on aircraft modernization programs, partially offset by lower deliveries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee; about $25 million for the C-130 program primarily due to lower volume and the timing of expenses for sustainment programs; and approximately $45 million for other aeronautics programs primarily due to lower risk retirements and the establishment of a reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $175 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. 2016 compared to 2015 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2016 increased $2.2 billion, or 14%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.7 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities, partially offset by lower volume on development activities; and approximately $290 million for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2016 compared to 21 in 2015) and increased sustainment activities; and approximately $250 million for the F-16 program primarily due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the C-5 program due to decreased sustainment activities.Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2016 increased $206 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $195 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements; and by approximately $60 million for aircraft support and maintenance programs due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for the C-130 program due to contract mix and lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $20 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.BacklogBacklog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs. Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, SNIPER®, LANTIRN® and Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS). In August 2017, we were awarded a contract for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program, which is a competitive follow-on contract to SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $7,212 $6,608 $6,770 Operating profit 1,053 1,018 1,282 Operating margin 14.6% 15.4% 18.9%Backlog at year-end $17,863 $14,704 $15,463 2017 compared to 2016 MFC’s net sales in 2017 increased $604 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $250 million for tactical missile programs due to product configuration mix and increased deliveries (JASSM) and due to increased deliveries for various other programs; about $210 million for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily PAC-3) and increased volume on certain programs (primarily THAAD); and about $110 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily LANTIRN® and SNIPER®).MFC’s operating profit in 2017 increased $35 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $70 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD), contract mix (primarily PAC-3), a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a contractual matter that did not recur in 2017, partially offset by lower risk retirements; and about 39Table of Contents$30 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily LANTIRN® and SNIPER®). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily JASSM and Hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $80 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.2016 compared to 2015 MFC’s net sales in 2016 decreased $162 million, or 2%, compared to 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $205 million for air and missile defense programs due to decreased volume (primarily THAAD); and lower net sales of approximately $95 million due to lower volume on various programs. These decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase for tactical missiles programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Hellfire); and approximately $70 million for fire control programs due to increased volume (SOF CLSS).MFC’s operating profit in 2016 decreased $264 million, or 21%, compared to 2015. Operating profit decreased approximately $145 million for air and missile defense programs due to lower risk retirements (PAC-3 and THAAD) and a reserve for a contractual matter; approximately $45 million for tactical missiles programs due to lower risk retirements (Javelin); and approximately $45 million for fire control programs due to lower risk retirements (Apache) and program mix. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $225 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015.BacklogBacklog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on Hellfire, Precision Fires and PAC-3. Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3, Hellfire, and JASSM. Rotary and Mission Systems As previously described, on November 6, 2015, we acquired Sikorsky and aligned the Sikorsky business under our RMS business segment. The 2015 results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. As a result, our consolidated operating results and RMS business segment operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky operations.Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters, ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, CH-53K development helicopter, VH-92A helicopter program, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, and The Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) contract. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $14,215 $13,462 $9,091 Operating profit 905 906 844 Operating margin 6.4% 6.7% 9.3%Backlog at year-end $28,974 $28,430 $30,076 2017 compared to 2016 RMS’ net sales in 2017 increased $753 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $680 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition and higher volume on certain helicopter programs; and about $160 million for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $50 million for IWSS programs due to lower volume. RMS’ operating profit in 2017 was comparable with 2016. Operating profit increased about $105 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease of $100 million for C4USS programs due to a net $95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract and $20 million for IWSS programs primarily due to a performance matter on the VLS program, partially offset by higher 40Table of Contentsrisk retirements (primarily LCS). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $55 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.2016 compared to 2015 RMS’ net sales in 2016 increased $4.4 billion, or 48%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $4.6 billion from Sikorsky helicopter programs, which was acquired on November 6, 2015. Net sales for 2015 include Sikorsky’s results subsequent to the acquisition date, net of certain revenue adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $115 million for IWSS programs due to decreased volume on various programs; and approximately $70 million for training and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our LMCFT business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date.RMS’ operating profit in 2016 increased $62 million, or 7%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for training and logistics programs due primarily to the divestiture of our LMCFT business which generated operating losses through its May 2, 2016 divestiture date; about $30 million for our IWSS programs due to investments made in connection with a next generation radar technology program awarded during 2015; and approximately $55 million for C4USS programs due primarily to higher reserves for performance matters on an international program in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $70 million as a result of a higher operating loss from Sikorsky, inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of intangible asset amortization and other adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business; and about $25 million for other matters. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $155 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.BacklogBacklog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a new multi-year award at Sikorsky. Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to sales being recognized on several multi-year programs (primarily in Sikorsky) related to prior year awards.Space Our Space business segment, previously known as Space Systems, is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Global Positioning System (GPS) III, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $9,473 $9,409 $9,105 Operating profit 993 1,289 1,171 Operating margin 10.5% 13.7% 12.9%Backlog at year-end $17,267 $18,842 $17,375 2017 compared to 2016 Space’s net sales in 2017 increased $64 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was attributable to approximately $810 million due to a full year of net sales from AWE in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $300 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $255 million for government satellite programs (primarily AEHF and SBIRS) due to lower volume; and approximately $190 million across other programs (including the Orion program) due to lower volume.Space’s operating profit in 2017 decreased $296 million, or 23%, compared to 2016. Operating profit decreased about $127 million due to the pre-tax gain recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of AWE; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ULA; about $30 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; a net decrease of about $25 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on certain commercial satellite programs; and about $25 million for government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and AEHF) due to a charge for performance matters and 41Table of Contentslower volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and changes in reserves, were about $20 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.2016 compared to 2015 Space’s net sales in 2016 increased $304 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $410 million from AWE following the consolidation of this business in the third quarter of 2016; and approximately $150 million for commercial space transportation programs due to increased launch-related activities; and approximately $70 million of higher net sales for various programs (primarily FBM) due to increased volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately $340 million for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs.Space’s operating profit in 2016 increased $118 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash, pre-tax gain of approximately $127 million related to the consolidation of AWE; and approximately $80 million of increased equity earnings from joint ventures (primarily ULA). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $105 million for government satellite programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily SBIRS, MUOS and mission solutions programs) and decreased volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $185 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $205 million, $325 million and $245 million, or 21%, 25% and 21% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2017, 2016 and 2015. BacklogBacklog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the Orion program. Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of AWE’s backlog.Liquidity and Cash FlowsWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2017. First, we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by 10% to $2.00 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. During 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases.We have accessed the capital markets opportunistically as we did in February 2015 when we issued $2.25 billion of long-term debt and as needed as we did in November 2015 when we issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Sikorsky. We also used a combination of short-term debt financing, commercial paper and available cash to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as discussed below in “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below for a discussion on financial resources available to us. We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding 42Table of Contentswill be required until 2021. We plan to fund these contributions and manage the timing of cash flows in 2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow us to issue new debt if circumstances change. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represents approximately 37% of the sales we recorded in 2017, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2017 and those planned for 2018 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2017 2016 2015Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $1,837 $1,090 $1,446Operating activities Net earnings 2,002 5,302 3,605Non-cash adjustments 4,514 (35) 821Changes in working capital (431) (1,042) (846)Other, net 391 964 1,521Net cash provided by operating activities 6,476 5,189 5,101Net cash used for investing activities (1,147) (985) (9,734)Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities (4,305) (3,457) 4,277Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,024 747 (356)Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $2,861 $1,837 $1,090Operating Activities2017 compared to 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. The change in working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. The change in working capital was largely driven by timing of cash receipts for accounts receivable (primarily PAC-3, THAAD, LANTIRN® and SNIPER®, and Sikorsky helicopter programs) and lower inventory. We made net income tax 43Table of Contentspayments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the Tax Act. We made interest payments of approximately $610 million and approximately $600 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture. We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. For discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under the caption “Funding Considerations”).2016 compared to 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $88 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and an increase in cash used for working capital. The $196 million increase in cash flows used for working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to timing of cash receipts for receivables (primarily F-35 program), partially offset by timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). We made net income tax payments of $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We made interest payments of approximately $600 million and $375 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million and approximately $500 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds received in the prior year related to properties sold. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $8.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $9.0 billion of cash used for acquisition activities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We had no significant cash acquisitions in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we paid $9.0 billion for the Sikorsky acquisition, net of cash acquired (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Capital expenditures amounted to $1.2 billion in 2017, $1.1 billion in 2016 and $939 million in 2015. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software.Additionally, in 2015, we received cash proceeds of approximately $165 million related to three properties sold in California. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in 2016 from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.Net cash used for financing activities increased $7.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2015 which did not recur in 2016, the repayments of long-term debt in 2016, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the one-time special cash payment of $1.8 billion from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities.In February 2015, we received net proceeds of $2.21 billion for the issuance of $2.25 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes. In November 2015, we borrowed $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes and received net proceeds of $6.9 billion (the November 2015 Notes). These proceeds were used to repay $6.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility that was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Sikorsky acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, to partially finance the Sikorsky acquisition we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0 billion under our commercial paper program. For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44Table of ContentsWe paid dividends totaling $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017, $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016 and $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015. We paid quarterly dividends of $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; and $1.50 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015.We paid $2.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion to repurchase 7.1 million, 8.9 million and 15.2 million shares of our common stock during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $71 million, $106 million and $174 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 0.8 million, 1.2 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock.Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $580 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions and a significant portion could be immediately available to fund U.S. operations upon repatriation. While our investment in our foreign subsidiaries continues to be permanent in duration, in light of our decision to accelerate contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries may be repatriated.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. During 2017, we sold approximately $698 million of customer receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.Revolving Credit FacilitiesOn October 9, 2015, we entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks. The 5‑year Facility was amended in October 2017 to extend its expiration date by one year from October 9, 2021 to October 9, 2022. The 5‑year Facility is available for general corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the 5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement.Long-Term DebtIn September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued 45Table of Contentsand unpaid interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.In November 2015, we issued $7.0 billion of notes (the November 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering with fixed rates ranging from 1.85% to 4.70% and maturing 2018 to 2046. We received net proceeds of $6.9 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The proceeds of the November 2015 Notes were used to repay $6.0 billion of borrowings under our 364-day Facility and for general corporate purposes.In February 2015, we issued $2.25 billion of notes (the February 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering with fixed rates ranging from 2.90% to 3.80% and maturing 2025 to 2045. We received net proceeds of $2.21 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The proceeds of the February 2015 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.Commercial PaperWe have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion 5-year Facility. During 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017. However, we may as conditions warrant issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows and to fund a portion of our defined benefit pension contributions of approximately $5.0 billion in 2018. Total EquityOur total deficit was $609 million at December 31, 2017 compared to equity of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in equity was primarily due to the estimated impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion, the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.4 billion, the repurchase of 7.1 million common shares for $2.0 billion; and dividends declared of $2.2 billion during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $2.0 billion, which includes the $1.9 billion net tax charge, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $802 million, and employee stock activity of $400 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation). As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.6 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2017.46Table of ContentsContractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2017, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $15,488 $750 $2,150 $906 $11,682Interest payments 10,510 624 1,180 1,048 7,658Other liabilities 2,883 256 561 412 1,654Operating lease obligations 623 162 270 136 55Purchase obligations: Operating activities 42,542 23,751 15,011 2,477 1,303Capital expenditures 522 398 105 19 —Total contractual cash obligations $72,568 $25,941$19,277$4,998$22,352(a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only and excludes approximately $10 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture, for which the debt is not guaranteed by us. The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $37.3 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2017, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $13.4 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2017 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017, in the 47Table of Contentsevent we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2017, ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation, as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this agreement.In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2017, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees.We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions and other directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2017, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than1 Year Years2 and 3 Years4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $2,187 $959 $733 $454 $41Surety bonds 368 357 2 9 —Third-party Guarantees 750 17 338 — 395Total commitments $3,305 $1,333 $1,073 $463 $436(a) Approximately $640 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $473 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $277 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2017, third-party guarantees totaled $750 million, of which approximately 62% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements. Critical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under a services accounting model. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. 48Table of ContentsWe classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments contracted through the U.S. Government. Contract Types Our contracts generally record sales for both products and services under fixed-price, cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts.Fixed-price contractsUnder fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 63%, 61%, and 57% of our total net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 37%, 38%, and 42% of our total net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive-fee contracts, which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Percentage-of-Completion Method We record net sales and estimated profits for substantially all of our contracts using the percentage-of-completion method for fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts for products and services with the U.S. Government. The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and 49Table of Contentstiming of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our business segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions (such as those mentioned in “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Services Method Under fixed-price service contracts, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers, we record net sales as services are performed, except for award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. 50Table of ContentsNew Accounting PronouncementOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (commonly referred to as ASC 606), which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. We adopted the requirements of the new standard on the effective date of January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, whereby ASC 606 will be applied to each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 will be recognized at January 1, 2016, the beginning of the earliest year presented. For additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).Postretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees; comprising the majority of our benefit obligations; to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze will take effect in two stages. On January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Actuarial AssumptionsThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 3.625% at December 31, 2017, compared to 4.125% at December 31, 2016 and 4.375% at December 31, 2015. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 3.625% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2017, compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2016 and 4.25% at December 31, 2015. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows.51Table of ContentsWe utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as compared to 8.00% at December 31, 2015. We reduced our expected long-term rate of return assumption in 2016 due to downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset classes in our trust. An increasingly aging population and debt burden place downward pressure on already low interest rates and economic growth; suggesting the future return for our fixed-income may be lower than historical norms. Surges in equities since 2009 have led to a high valuation of the equity markets, suggesting the forward return may also be lower than historical norms. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. In both October 2017 and 2016, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 re-measurements of benefit obligation. The publications were a refinement to assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $12.6 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2017. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. During 2017, $802 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $1.2 billion is expected to be recognized as expense in 2018. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 3.625% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2017, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2017 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 3.625% discount rate at December 31, 2017 that was used to compute the expected 2018 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2018 would be lower or higher by approximately $115 million. If the 7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2017 that was used to compute the expected 2018 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2018 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2017 between our actual rate of return of approximately 13.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% impacted 2018 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million.Funding ConsiderationsThere were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. The ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. As a result of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirements under the PPA, there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirements. On August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) was enacted; and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015; which extend the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the 52Table of Contentsinterest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in 2021 and phase out by 2024. This has the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise would have been. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 83% and 86% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 68% and 70% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.0 billion in 2016, and $1.6 billion in 2015 as CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there was a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that was phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. The incremental impact of CAS Harmonization increased successively through 2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs.Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2017, our prepayment credits were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2016. The recovery of CAS pension costs under U.S. Government contracts in excess of our contributions reduces the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets. TrendsWe will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until 2021. We plan to fund these contributions using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow us to issue new debt if circumstances change (see our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion above). We anticipate recovering approximately $2.4 billion of CAS pension cost in 2018. We expect our 2018 FAS pension expense to be $1.4 billion; comparable to our 2017 FAS pension expense of $1.4 billion. The impact of the lower FAS discount rate of 3.625% for 2018 versus 4.125% for 2017 was mostly offset by our actual rate of investment return in 2017 of approximately 13.00% versus our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%, shortened longevity assumptions, and 2018 cash contributions of $5.0 billion versus immaterial cash contributions in 2017. We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2018 of about $1.0 billion, as compared to $876 million in 2017, due to higher 2018 CAS pension costs as compared to 2017. Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $920 million and $1.0 billion. We have recorded receivables totaling $799 million and $870 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.53Table of ContentsWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). Recently, this standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re-established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium. California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. 54Table of ContentsGoodwillAs disclosed in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”), at the beginning of the quarter ended September 24, 2017, we adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill (commonly referred to as Step 2) from the goodwill impairment test and requires entities to only compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting units’ carrying amount to determine goodwill impairment. We elected to adopt the new standard at the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 because it significantly simplifies the evaluation of goodwill for impairment and we have updated our critical accounting policy for goodwill to reflect the adoption of the new standard. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year. To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units utilizing the statutory tax rate in effect at the time of the test. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units, including Sikorsky, no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 25%, after adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rates due to the passage of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. We acquired Sikorsky in November 2015 and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. As a result, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit continue to be closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit 55Table of Contentsis at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. We performed goodwill impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment, and there was no indication of goodwill impairment.Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. Should the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings. The carrying value of our Sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset utilizing the statutory tax rate in effect at the time of the test and the results indicated that no impairment existed. At December 31, 2017, the Sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 20%, after adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rates due to the passage of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. Additionally, our Sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. As discussed above in the Goodwill section, the carrying value and fair value of Sikorsky’s intangible assets continue to be closely aligned due to the November 2015 acquisition of Sikorsky. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”). ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.5 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.2 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2017.56Table of ContentsWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2017, investments in the trust totaled $1.4 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2017.57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:50.007990
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2019,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewWe are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2018, 70% of our $53.8 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 60% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.2019 Financial TrendsWe expect our 2019 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2018 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and sustainment on the F-35 program at Aeronautics and key contract awards and increased volume in the tactical and strike missiles business at MFC. Total business segment operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to be approximately 10.8%; and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.4 billion. The preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2019 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.We expect the net 2019 FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $1.5 billion based on a 4.25% discount rate (a 62.5 basis point increase from the end of 2017), a negative 5.00% return on plan assets in 2018, a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years (a 50 basis point decrease from the end of 2017), and the revised longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2018 by the Society of Actuaries. As a result of our $5.0 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.25Table of ContentsDivestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business On August 16, 2016, we divested our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. In 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital. For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Consolidation of AWE Management Limited On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. Consequently, we began consolidating AWE and our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit.For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Industry ConsiderationsU.S. Government Funding For the first time in nearly a decade, the DoD began the government fiscal year (FY) with a full-year appropriation. Congress passed, and the President signed into law an appropriation act that provides $685 billion in funding for the DoD for FY 2019, which is comprised of $617 billion in base funding and $68 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account to support the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The appropriation adheres to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA of 2018), which provided an additional $80 billion for national defense over two years in FY 2018 and FY 2019. However, the U.S. Government has not yet passed full-year appropriations for all agencies. A majority of U.S. Government agencies operated under continuing resolution funding measures through December 21, 2018. Congress was unable to reach an agreement on full-year appropriations prior to its expiration. Consequently, a majority of U.S. Government agencies were shutdown through January 25, 2019 when an agreement was reached to provide funding under a continuing resolution funding measure through February 15, 2019. These agencies may be subject to future shutdowns if new appropriations are not passed prior to the expiration of the current continuing resolution.The President has not yet submitted the budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress due to administrative delays associated with the partial government shutdown that began on December 22, 2018 and ended on January 25, 2019. Once submitted, Congress must approve or revise the President’s FY 2020 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President.Currently, U.S. defense spending in FY 2020 and FY 2021 remains subject to statutory spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act). The Budget Control Act spending limits were modified for fiscal years 2013 through 2019 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and most recently the BBA of 2018. However, these acts do not alter the spending limits beyond FY 2019. As currently enacted, the Budget Control Act limits defense spending to $576 billion (including approximately $550 billion for DoD) for FY 2020 with a modest increase to $590 billion (including approximately $563 billion for DoD) in 2021. The President’s defense budget estimates for FY 2020 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified.

To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers.International customers accounted for 36% of Aeronautics’ 2018 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and four international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. During 2018, the government of Belgium announced its decision to purchase 34 F-35 aircraft. Additionally in 2018, we finalized the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 11 contract with the DoD at $11.5 billion of funding for the production of 141 F-35 aircraft. This award includes international F-35 partners and FMS customers. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 program. During 2018, we received a $1.1 billion contract from the U.S. Government to produce 16 new production F-16 Block 70 aircraft for the Royal Bahraini Air Force. The Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) award represents the first F-16 Block 70 sale and the first F-16 production program to be performed in Greenville, South Carolina. Additionally, in December 2018, Slovakia signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to procure 14 new production F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and we were awarded a contract to upgrade 84 F-16 aircraft for the Greek Ministry of Defence.In 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. We have ongoing PAC-3 programs for production and sustainment activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Additionally during 2018, the U.S. and Swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide PAC-3 missiles to Sweden. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. UAE is an international customer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for Hellfire missile systems from the Netherlands and Japan, precision fires systems from Romania, as well as interest from Poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Other MFC international customers include the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Kuwait, and Bahrain.In 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing programs in Canada and Chile for combat systems equipment upgrades on Halifax-class and Type 23 frigates. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Egypt, Singapore, and Australia. In addition, Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the RMS business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70i Black Hawk® and MH-60 Seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and VIP customers in over 30 countries.International customers accounted for 16% of Space’s 2018 net sales. Our Space business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space has international contracts with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform.27Table of ContentsStatus of the F-35 Program The F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.During 2018, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 175,000 flight hours. In April 2018, we completed the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) flight testing portion of the development contract and began the next phase of development in support of phased capability improvements and modernization of the F-35 air system. This next phase of development work is being performed separately from the basic SDD contract as part of the Joint Program Office’s Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) strategy. On June 11, we delivered the 300th production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. The first 300 F-35 aircraft delivered to U.S. and international customers include 197 F-35A variants, 75 F-35B variants, and 28 F-35C variants. In December 2018, the DoD officially approved the F-35 program to begin the formal Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) phase. Testing is expected to be completed during 2019. The data will be analyzed by the U.S. Government as part of their evaluation to transition the F-35 program from LRIP into full-rate production at the end of 2019. Several milestones were also achieved with our U.S. Government and international customers. First, United Kingdom’s F-35B carried out the first trials with UK-built weapons. This represents a key part of the work-up toward Initial Operating Capability efforts. Second, F-35Cs’ participated in Integrated Flight Operations aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. Third, a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B conducted the first combat strike in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan on September 27. Fourth, the Royal Navy landed the F-35B on the HMS Queen Elizabeth.On September 28, we finalized the LRIP 11 contract with the DoD at $11.5 billion for the production and delivery of 141 F-35 aircraft at the lowest per aircraft price in program history. In November 2018, the U.S. Government awarded an aggregate $22.7 billion UCA Block Buy for the production of 252 F-35 aircraft in order to provide greater production efficiency, stability and cost savings. As of December 31, 2018, we have delivered 357 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners, and we have 396 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.28Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2018 2017 2016Net sales $53,762 $49,960 $47,290Cost of sales (46,488) (43,589) (41,889)Gross profit 7,274 6,371 5,401Other income, net 60 373 487Operating profit (a) 7,334 6,744 5,888Interest expense (668) (651) (663)Other non-operating expense, net (828) (847) (471)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 5,838 5,246 4,754Income tax expense (b) (792) (3,356) (1,093)Net earnings from continuing operations 5,046 1,890 3,661Net earnings from discontinued operations — 73 1,512Net earnings $5,046 $1,963 $5,173Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $17.59 $6.50 $12.08Discontinued operations — 0.25 4.99Total diluted earnings per common share $17.59 $6.75 $17.07(a) For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating profit includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 (see “Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of AWE of approximately $104 million (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).(b) In 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.29Table of ContentsNet SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Products $45,005 $42,502 $40,081 % of total net sales 83.7% 85.1% 84.8%Services 8,757 7,458 7,209 % of total net sales 16.3% 14.9% 15.2%Total net sales $53,762 $49,960 $47,290 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Product Sales Product sales increased $2.5 billion, or 6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.2 billion at Aeronautics, $1.0 billion at MFC and $315 million at RMS. Higher product sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the F-16 program. The increase at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires). The increase at RMS was primarily due to increased production volume for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs (primarily radar surveillance systems).Product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.9 billion at Aeronautics and $340 million at MFC. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the F-35 program due to increased production volume and higher sales for the C-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales for the C-5 program due to lower production volume. Higher product sales at MFC was primarily due to an increase in sales for air and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)), higher sales for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs), and higher sales for sensor and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SNIPER®). Service SalesService sales increased $1.3 billion, or 17%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $605 million at Aeronautics, $270 million at RMS, and $245 million at Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-22 programs. Higher service sales at RMS was primarily due to increased volume for C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and IWSS programs. The increase in service sales at Space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services. Service sales increased $249 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $200 million at Aeronautics, $155 million at MFC and $70 million at RMS. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service sales of about $180 million at Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and C-130 programs). Higher service sales at MFC was primarily attributable to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS)). Higher service sales at RMS was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities at Sikorsky. The decrease in service sales at Space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services. 30Table of ContentsCost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Cost of sales – products $(40,293) $(38,417) $(36,394) % of product sales 89.5% 90.4% 90.8%Cost of sales – services (7,738) (6,673) (6,423) % of service sales 88.4% 89.5% 89.1%Severance and restructuring charges (96) — (80) Other unallocated, net 1,639 1,501 1,008 Total cost of sales $(46,488) $(43,589) $(41,889) The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product CostsProduct costs increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $820 million at MFC. Higher product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the F-16 program. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires). Product costs increased approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.5 billion at Aeronautics and $315 million at MFC. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on aircraft production for the F-35 program and higher cost for the C-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in cost for the C-5 program due to lower production volume. Higher product costs at MFC was primarily attributable to an increase in cost for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (classified programs) and higher product costs for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix (primarily PAC-3) and higher volume (primarily THAAD). Service CostsService costs increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased service costs of about $535 million at Aeronautics, $215 million at RMS, and $170 million at Space. The increase in service costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-22 programs. Higher service costs at RMS were primarily due to increased volume for various C6ISR and IWSS programs. The increase in service costs at Space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.Service costs increased approximately $250 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $230 million at Aeronautics and $150 million at MFC. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about$135 million at Space. Higher service costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and C-130 programs). Higher service costs at MFC was primarily attributable to higher volume on sustainment activities (primarily PAC-3 and SOF CLSS). The decrease in service costs at Space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.31Table of ContentsRestructuring Charges2018 ActionsDuring 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at our RMS business segment. These charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of 2019. These actions resulted from a strategic review of our RMS business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. We expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in RMS’ operating results. During 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.2016 ActionsDuring 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $1.6 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016. The increase in net reduction in expense from 2018 to 2017 and 2017 to 2016 was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1.8 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The increase in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment over the periods was primarily attributable to an increase in U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost. Additionally, the increase in net reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016 from our former IS&GS business to other unallocated, net. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about costs reclassified to other unallocated, net.Other Income, NetOther income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. Other income, net in 2018 was $60 million, compared to $373 million in 2017 and $487 million in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the recognition in 2018 of a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to our equity method investee, AMMROC, decreased earnings generated by equity method investees, and the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in 2017 of our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, AMMROC. These decreases were partially offset by the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of AWE.32Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense in 2018 was $668 million, compared to $651 million in 2017 and $663 million in 2016. The slight increase in interest expense in 2018 resulted primarily from increased interest expense on interest rate swaps and commercial paper, partially offset by our scheduled repayment of $750 million of debt during 2018. The decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.Other Non-Operating Expense, NetOther non-operating expense, net primarily includes the non-service cost components of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits) related to our postretirement benefit plans. Other non-operating expense, net in 2018 decreased slightly compared to 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in other costs associated with various items, none of which were individually significant. Other non-operating expense, net increased $376 million from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher non-service cost components of FAS expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.Income Tax ExpenseOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 13.6% for 2018, 64.0% for 2017, and 23.0% for 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by $2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act. We recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the Tax Act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.9 billion), a deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017. The net one-time charge related to the Tax Act increased our 2017 effective income tax rate by 37.5 percentage points. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the Tax Act. As of December 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net, one-time charge for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the Tax Act.We recognized a new tax benefit in 2018 of $61 million related to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the Tax Act, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point. We also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point, from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 Court of Federal Claims decision, which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets’ disposition. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The Tax Act repealed the U.S. manufacturing benefit for years after 2017. The U.S. manufacturing benefit for 2017 was insignificant, compared to a reduction of our effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points for 2016. The 2017 benefit was reduced by $81 million because of our 2017 decision after enactment of the Tax Act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit pension plans. The R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points in 2018 and 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016. The rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE.In addition, the rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $55 million, $106 million, and $152 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points, and 3.2 percentage points. Future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. 33Table of ContentsNet Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $1.9 billion ($6.50 per share) in 2017 and $3.7 billion ($12.08 per share) in 2016. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.0 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. From December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 5.0 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations We reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the IS&GS business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017 and $1.5 billion ($4.99 per share) in 2016. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business.Net EarningsWe reported net earnings of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $2.0 billion ($6.75 per share) in 2017 and $5.2 billion ($17.07 per share) in 2016. Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for all years presented. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment for our qualified defined benefit pension plans (described below); the adjustment from CAS to the FAS service cost component for all other postretirement benefit plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and significant severance and restructuring actions (see “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); gains or losses from significant divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated operating profit in our consolidated financial statements must present the service cost component of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations. The non-service FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have a favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment.34Table of ContentsSummary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Net sales Aeronautics $21,242 $19,410 $17,293Missiles and Fire Control 8,462 7,282 6,789Rotary and Mission Systems 14,250 13,663 13,595Space 9,808 9,605 9,613Total net sales $53,762 $49,960 $47,290Operating profit Aeronautics $2,272 $2,176 $1,845Missiles and Fire Control 1,248 1,034 1,004Rotary and Mission Systems 1,302 902 845Space (a) 1,055 980 1,288Total business segment operating profit 5,877 5,092 4,982Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment (b) 1,803 1,613 1,250Stock-based compensation (173) (158) (149)Severance and restructuring charges (c) (96) — (80)Other, net (d) (77) 197 (115)Total unallocated, net 1,457 1,652 906Total consolidated operating profit $7,334 $6,744 $5,888(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million at our Space business segment, which increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million ($0.34 per share) in 2016. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).(b) The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total pension costs recoverable on U.S. Government contracts as determined in accordance with CAS. For a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and the total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, see the table below. (c) See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance and restructuring charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (d) Other, net in 2018 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Other, net in 2017 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations (see “Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) and a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).35Table of ContentsTotal net FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension expense, were as follows (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Total FAS expense and CAS costs FAS pension expense $(1,431) $(1,372) $(1,019)Less: CAS pension cost 2,433 2,248 1,921Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment $1,002 $876 $902 Service and non-service cost reconciliation FAS pension service cost (630) (635) (671)Less: CAS pension cost 2,433 2,248 1,921FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,803 1,613 1,250Non-operating FAS pension expense (a) (801) (737) (348)Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment $1,002 $876 $902(a) We record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The non-service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million, $109 million, and $123 million for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both service and non-service).The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $130.5 billion, $105.5 billion and $103.5 billion at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $86.4 billion at December 31, 2018.Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding 36Table of Contentsthe technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; severance and restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. As previously disclosed, we have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers – intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the EADGE-T contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our RMS business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. As of December 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. We continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.We have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our Space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These programs require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced LM 2100 satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through December 31, 2018. In 2018, we recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. These programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. We previously disclosed that, as we did not meet the July 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. One of the satellites has now been launched, eliminating this risk. As the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so. Were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay certain penalties. On the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.37Table of ContentsWe are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. In 2018, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22 per share, after tax) at our MFC business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program as of December 31, 2018. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. However, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. The increase in consolidated net adjustments in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our MFC, RMS, and Space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our Aeronautics business segment. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics and Space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our RMS business segment. The consolidated net adjustments for 2018 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program at MFC, various programs at RMS, and commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2017 are inclusive of approximately $800 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract, Vertical Launching System (VLS) program and other programs at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space.Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Net sales $21,242 $19,410 $17,293 Operating profit 2,272 2,176 1,845 Operating margin 10.7% 11.2% 10.7%Backlog at year-end $55,601 $35,692 $34,999 2018 compared to 2017Aeronautics’ net sales in 2018 increased $1.8 billion, or 9%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.5 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment, partially offset by lower volume on development activities; about $300 million for other programs due to higher volume (primarily ADP); about $210 million for the F-16 program due to increased volume on modernization contracts; and about $110 million for the F-22 program due to increased sustainment volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $130 million for the C-130 program primarily due to lower volume on sustainment activities and about $130 million for the C-5 program due to lower volume as deliveries under the current production modernization program were completed in the third quarter of 2018.Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2018 increased $96 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $250 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on higher margin production contracts and new development activities and better performance on sustainment. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of about $65 million for the C-130 program due to lower risk retirements and lower sustainment volume; about $60 million for the F-16 program due to lower risk retirements; and about $35 million for the C-5 program due to lower risk retirements and lower production volume. Adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $175 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017.2017 compared to 2016Aeronautics’ net sales in 2017 increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $2.0 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $155 million for the C-130 program primarily due to increased production volume and due to aircraft configuration mix; and about 38Table of Contents$95 million for the F-22 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $195 million for the C-5 program due to lower production volume. Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2017 increased $331 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased approximately $300 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the F-16 program due to higher risk retirements partially offset by lower volume on aircraft modernization programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee. Adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $245 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.BacklogBacklog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs.TrendsWe currently expect Aeronautics’ 2019 net sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by the increased volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range, resulting in comparable operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, SNIPER®, LANTIRN® and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS). MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Net sales $8,462 $7,282 $6,789 Operating profit 1,248 1,034 1,004 Operating margin 14.7% 14.2% 14.8%Backlog at year-end $21,363 $17,729 $14,204 2018 compared to 2017 MFC’s net sales in 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $925 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily classified programs and precision fires); and about $185 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily LANTIRN, SNIPER, and Apache).MFC’s operating profit in 2018 increased $214 million, or 21%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $140 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to reserves which were recorded in 2017 but did not recur in 2018 (primarily Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)), higher risk retirements (primarily precision fires and Hellfire) and higher volume (primarily precision fires); and about $50 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily LANTIRN, SNIPER, and Apache), after charges of approximately $85 million previously recorded in 2018 for performance matters on the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $200 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.2017 compared to 2016 MFC’s net sales in 2017 increased $493 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $205 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily PAC-3) and increased volume on certain programs (primarily THAAD); and about $135 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily SOF GLSS and LANTIRN and SNIPER); and about $110 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs).39Table of ContentsMFC’s operating profit in 2017 increased $30 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $85 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD), contract mix (primarily PAC-3), and a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a contractual matter that did not recur in 2017; and about $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased risk retirements and higher volume (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $120 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily precision fires and Hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $10 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.BacklogBacklog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, precision fires, and other tactical missiles programs. Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on Hellfire, precision fires and PAC-3. TrendsWe currently expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by key contract awards in 2018 and higher volume in the tactical and strike missiles business. Operating profit is expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the increase in sales volume. Operating profit margin for 2019 is expected to be slightly lower than 2018 levels.Rotary and Mission Systems Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, VH-92A helicopter program, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) contract. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Net sales $14,250 $13,663 $13,595 Operating profit 1,302 902 845 Operating margin 9.1% 6.6% 6.2%Backlog at year-end $31,320 $30,030 $29,029 2018 compared to 2017 RMS’ net sales in 2018 increased $587 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily radar surveillance systems programs and Multi Mission Surface Combatant); and about $250 million for C6ISR programs due to higher volume on multiple programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $270 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs, which reflect lower volume for Black Hawk production, partially offset by higher volume for CH-53K King Stallion development and for mission systems programs. RMS’ operating profit in 2018 increased $400 million, or 44%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $185 million for C6ISR programs due to charges of $120 million for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract, recorded in 2017 but which did not recur in 2018, and due to higher risk retirements (primarily undersea systems programs); about $155 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to better cost performance across the Sikorsky portfolio and better cost performance on the Multi-Year IX contract; and about $105 million for IWSS programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily Aegis). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $185 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.40Table of Contents2017 compared to 2016 RMS’ net sales in 2017 increased $68 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume; about $55 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily Aegis); and about $40 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition, partially offset by lower volume on certain helicopter programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $100 million for C6ISR programs due to lower volume.RMS’ operating profit in 2017 increased $57 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $120 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition; and about $30 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume and increased risk retirements, partially offset by a $20 million charge for performance matters on the Vertical Launching System (VLS) program. This increase was offset by a decrease of $105 million for C6ISR programs primarily due to a net $95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $45 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.BacklogBacklog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on IWSS and C6ISR programs. Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a new multi-year award at Sikorsky.TrendsWe currently expect RMS’ net sales to be slightly above 2018 levels. Operating profit is also expected to be slightly above 2018 levels resulting in similar operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.Space Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Net sales $9,808 $9,605 $9,613 Operating profit 1,055 980 1,288 Operating margin 10.8% 10.2% 13.4%Backlog at year-end $22,184 $22,042 $25,226 2018 compared to 2017 Space’s net sales in 2018 increased $203 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $225 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily AWE and FBM) and about $65 million for the Orion program due to higher volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $70 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume and about $25 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume.Space’s operating profit in 2018 increased $75 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $40 million for commercial satellite programs, which reflect a lower amount of charges recorded for performance matters on certain programs; and about $30 million for government satellite programs primarily due to higher volume and higher risk retirements for government satellite services. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $30 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.41Table of Contents2017 compared to 2016 Space’s net sales in 2017 were comparable with 2016. The slight decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately $300 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $245 million for government satellite programs (primarily AEHF and SBIRS) due to lower volume; approximately $190 million across other programs (including the Orion program) due to lower volume; and about $90 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $810 million due to a full year of net sales from AWE in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016. Space’s operating profit in 2017 decreased $308 million, or 24%, compared to 2016. Operating profit decreased $127 million due to the pre-tax gain recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of AWE; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ULA; about $30 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $35 million for government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and AEHF) due to a charge for performance matters and lower volume; and a net decrease of about $35 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on certain commercial satellite programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $20 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million, or 20%, 21% and 25% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2018, 2017 and 2016. BacklogBacklog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to new orders on government satellite programs, specifically Next Gen OPIR and GPS III. Backlog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the Orion program.TrendsWe currently expect Space's 2019 net sales to be comparable to 2018 levels. Operating profit in 2019 is expected to decrease in the low-double digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by lower equity earnings in 2019 compared to 2018. As a result, operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to decrease from 2018 levels.Liquidity and Cash FlowsWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and, selective business acquisitions and investments, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates and pension obligations. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2018. First, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by 10% to $2.20 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows. We also have additional access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below for a discussion on available financial resources. We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. We funded these contributions in 2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. 42Table of ContentsDuring 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases.Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represent approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2018, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2018 and those planned for 2019 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $2,861 $1,837 $1,090Operating activities Net earnings 5,046 1,963 5,173Non-cash adjustments 1,186 4,530 (35)Changes in working capital (1,401) (427) (826)Other, net (1,693) 410 877Net cash provided by operating activities 3,138 6,476 5,189Net cash used for investing activities (1,075) (1,147) (985)Net cash used for financing activities (4,152) (4,305) (3,457)Net change in cash and cash equivalents (2,089) 1,024 747Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $772 $2,861 $1,837Operating Activities2018 compared to 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and an increase in cash used for working capital of $974 million, partially offset by an increase in net earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. The increase in cash used for working capital was largely driven by the timing of cash collections for the F-35 program and Sikorsky helicopter programs. We received net income tax refunds of $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to making net income tax payments of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net refunds in 2018 were primarily the result a 2017 net operating loss carryback arising from our accelerated pension contributions. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in 2018 benefited 43Table of Contentsmaterially from the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017. We made interest payments of approximately $635 million and approximately $610 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.2017 compared to 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. The decrease in cash used for working capital was largely driven by timing of cash collections (primarily PAC-3, THAAD, LANTIRN and SNIPER, and Sikorsky helicopter programs). We made net income tax payments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We made interest payments of approximately $610 million and approximately $600 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities decreased $72 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to approximately $105 million of cash received as part of the final settlement of net working capital in connection with the 2016 divestiture of our IS&GS business and cash received for various other items, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds received in 2016 related to properties sold.Capital expenditures amounted to $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities decreased $153 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $600 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2018 and an increase in dividend payments.Net cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in 2016 from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities.For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.We paid $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to repurchase 4.7 million, 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock during 2018, 2017 and 2016.44Table of ContentsCapital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents of $772 million that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and is mainly in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which approximately $900 million was composed of scheduled debt maturity due in November 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average rate of 2.89%. During 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. We sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of customer receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.Revolving Credit FacilitiesOn August 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The 5‑year Facility has an expiration date of August 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the 5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement.Long-Term DebtIn November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year and began on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.45Table of ContentsWe have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.Total EquityOur total equity was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $776 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in equity was primarily due to net earnings of $5.0 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $1.2 billion, and employee stock activity of $406 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $501 million, the repurchase of 4.7 million common shares for $1.5 billion; and dividends declared of $2.3 billion during the year.As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2018.Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2018, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Total debt (a) $15,299 $1,500 $2,150 $625 $11,024Interest payments 9,885 609 1,110 1,009 7,157Other liabilities 2,773 259 536 382 1,596Operating lease obligations 1,297 305 331 202 459Purchase obligations: Operating activities 50,784 22,862 22,745 3,422 1,755Capital expenditures 487 392 95 — —Total contractual cash obligations $80,525 $25,927$26,967$5,640$21,991(a) Total debt includes scheduled principal payments and the repayment of commercial paper and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture as we do not guarantee the debt.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2018. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $45.9 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. 46Table of ContentsWe also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2018, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $12.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2018 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) were previously required to provide ULA an additional capital contribution if ULA was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ULA an additional capital contribution under this agreement.We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than1 Year Years2 and 3 Years4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $2,284 $1,302 $707 $247 $28Surety bonds 425 414 11 — —Third-party Guarantees 850 185 270 2 393Total commitments $3,559 $1,901 $988 $249 $421(a) Approximately $925 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $357 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $24 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2018, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million, of which approximately 65% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.47Table of ContentsCritical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales RecognitionThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition 48Table of ContentsRegulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. Our non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. However, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative use to us.For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating 49Table of Contentsprofit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.Postretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze takes effect in two stages. On January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.Additionally, in recent years we have taken other actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial results. For example, in December 2018, a Lockheed Martin qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased two contracts from insurance companies covering $2.6 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. First, in December 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan’s outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 9,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. On December 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. This transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost. The difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized 50Table of Contentsto FAS pension expense in future periods. We intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract to a buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. The buy-out conversion, expected to occur as early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. A subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the U.S. Government. Also, during December 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were less than this plan’s service and interest cost in 2018. Accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost, and the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to FAS pension expense in future periods. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.Actuarial AssumptionsThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 4.250% at December 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at December 31, 2017 and 4.125% at December 31, 2016. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 4.250% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at December 31, 2017 and 4.00% at December 31, 2016. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows.We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at December 31, 2018 compared to 7.50% for both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate.In both October 2018 and 2017, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 re-measurements of benefit obligation. The publications were a refinement to assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.51Table of ContentsOur stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $14.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2018. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. During 2018, $1.2 billion of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $908 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2019. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.250% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2018, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2018 by approximately $1.4 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. If the 4.250% discount rate at December 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $120 million. If the 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2018 between our negative actual rate of return of approximately 5.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% impacted 2019 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million.Funding ConsiderationsWe made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. There were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.4 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, and $2.0 billion in 2016 as CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012 and fully transitioned to in 2017, the CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2018, our prepayment credits were approximately $8.5 billion as compared to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to our cash contributions of $5.0 billion in 2018 compared to our $2.4 billion in CAS recoveries. Cash contributions in excess of the recovery of CAS pension costs under U.S. Government contracts increases the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.TrendsWe made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. We anticipate recovering approximately $2.6 billion of CAS pension cost in 2019 allowing us to recuperate a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.We expect our 2019 FAS pension expense to be $1.1 billion; compared to our 2018 FAS pension expense of $1.4 billion. The impact of the higher FAS discount rate of 4.25% for 2019 versus 3.625% for 2018 was partly offset by our negative actual rate of investment return in 2018 of approximately 5.00% versus our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%. We expect a FAS/CAS 52Table of Contentspension benefit in 2019 of about $1.5 billion, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2018, due to the lower 2019 FAS pension expense and higher 2019 CAS pension cost as compared to 2018.Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). This standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‑established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation costs in California. Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental 53Table of Contentsremediation receivables and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.GoodwillThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent 54Table of Contentsin future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units, including Sikorsky, no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 20%. The carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit is closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit.Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. Should the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.The carrying value of our Sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the Sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 5%. Additionally, our Sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).55Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.2 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2018.We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2018, investments in the trust totaled $1.3 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.56Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:50.311490
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2020,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The MD&A generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2019.We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2019, 71% of our $59.8 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.2020 Financial TrendsWe expect our 2020 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2019 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased volume at all four business areas. Specifically, the increased growth is driven by the F-35 program at Aeronautics, increased volume in the tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense businesses at MFC, Sikorsky volume at RMS, and hypersonics volume at Space. Total business segment operating profit margin in 2020 is expected to be approximately 10.8%; and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.6 billion. The preliminary outlook for 2020 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2020 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.We expect a net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.1 billion in 2020 based on a 3.25% discount rate (a 100 basis point decrease from the end of 2018), an approximate 21% return on plan assets in 2019, a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, and the revised longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2019 by the Society of Actuaries. We do not expect to make any contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2020 and anticipate recovering approximately $2.0 billion of CAS pension cost. As previously announced on July 1, 2014, we completed the final step of the planned freeze of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees effective January 1, 2020. The service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits is frozen such that participants are no longer earning further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. As a result of these changes, the plans are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020. Retirees already collecting 27Table of Contentsbenefits and former employees with a vested benefit were not affected by the change. Current employees also will retain all benefits already earned in their pension plan to date.Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.Divestiture of Distributed Energy SolutionsOn November 18, 2019, we completed the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions (DES) business, a commercial energy service provider that was part of our MFC business segment. We received $225 million in cash from the sale and recognized a gain of $34 million (approximately $0 after-tax) for the sale. Amounts related to this divestiture were not significant to the corporation and the sale did not represent a strategic shift, and accordingly, the operating results, financial position and cash flows for the DES business have not been reclassified to discontinued operations. Industry ConsiderationsU.S. Government Funding On December 20, 2019, the President signed the annual fiscal year (FY) 2020 appropriations, funding the DoD and other government agencies (a U.S. Government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30). The appropriations provide $738 billion in discretionary funding for national defense, including $667 billion in base funding and $71 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/emergency funding (OCO and emergency supplemental funding do not count toward discretionary spending caps). Of the $738 billion, the DoD is allocated $709 billion; composed of $637 billion in base funding and $72 billion in OCO and emergency funding.The approved funding is in accordance with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA-19), which was enacted on August 2, 2019. The BBA-19 increased the spending limits for both defense and non-defense discretionary funding for the U.S. Government FY 2020 and 2021 set under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). The defense spending limits were increased by $90 billion to $667 billion for FY 2020 and by $81 billion to $672 billion for FY 2021. When combined with approved OCO/emergency funding, the agreement raised top-line spending for national defense to the $738 billion enacted in FY 2020 and $741 billion in FY 2021. By raising the spending limits, the BBA-19 essentially ended the budgetary constraints implemented by the 2011 BCA. Additionally, the BBA-19 also suspended the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021, at which time the debt limit will be increased to the amount of U.S. Government debt outstanding on that date.International BusinessA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.International customers accounted for 37% of Aeronautics’ 2019 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and four international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. While, in July 2019, the DoD announced plans to remove Turkey, who had previously committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, from the F-35 program, we received congressional notification of approval of the proposed sale of 32 F-35A aircraft to Poland in the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, in January 2019, Singapore announced its selection of the F-35 as their next generation fighter. Singapore’s initial request is for four F-35s, with the option of eight additional aircraft. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 program. In August 2019, the Bulgarian government and the U.S. Government signed a letter of offer and acceptance worth $1.26 billion regarding Bulgaria’s planned procurement of eight new production F-16 Block 70 aircraft for the Bulgarian Air Force.28Table of ContentsIn 2019, international customers accounted for 24% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. We have ongoing PAC-3 programs for production and sustainment activities in Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Poland and Taiwan. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are international customers for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for Apache and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) systems for Qatar, and precision fires systems from Poland and Romania. Other MFC international customers include the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Kuwait and Bahrain.In 2019, international customers accounted for 25% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis). We perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing programs in Canada and Chile for combat systems equipment upgrades on Halifax-class and Type 23 frigates. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program provides surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Egypt, Singapore, and Australia. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70i Black Hawk® and MH-60 Seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and VIP customers in over 30 countries.International customers accounted for 14% of Space’s 2019 net sales. Our Space business segment includes the operations of AWE Management Limited (AWE), which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning, and disposal. In addition, Space has an international contract with Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the LM2100 satellite platform.Status of the F-35 ProgramThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight international partner countries and four international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.During 2019, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 240,000 flight hours. During 2019, multiple customers declared Initial Operating Capability including the U.S. Navy for its F-35C variant, the United Kingdom for its F-35B variant, Japan for its F-35A variant, and Norway for its F-35A variant. Since program inception, we have delivered 491 production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. The first 491 F-35 aircraft delivered to U.S. and international customers include 347 F-35A variants, 108 F-35B variants, and 36 F-35C variants. The full-rate production decision, also known formally as Milestone C, is expected to be delayed by the DoD until Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) activities are complete in the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)-led Joint Simulation Environment (JSE). The JSE is used to conduct simulated evaluations of the F-35 in a range of high-threat scenarios. Testing is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The data will be utilized by the U.S. Government as part of their evaluation to transition the F-35 program from Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) into full-rate production.During the fourth quarter of 2019, the U.S. Government and Lockheed Martin finalized a Block Buy agreement for the production and delivery of F-35s in Lots 12, 13 and 14 at the lowest aircraft price in the history of the program. This includes amounts previously awarded by the U.S. Government in November 2018 for the production of 252 Block Buy F-35 aircraft. As part of the fourth quarter 2019 agreement, the U.S. Government awarded the production of an additional 112 F-35 Block Buy Aircraft. We delivered 134 production aircraft in 2019 to our U.S. and international partner countries, and we have 374 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partner countries.On July 17, 2019, the U.S. Government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program and initiated the process to formally remove Turkey from the program as a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system. To date, the Administration has not imposed sanctions on Turkish entities involved in the S-400 procurement, although sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) remain a risk. Additionally, sanctions 29Table of Contentscould be imposed against Turkey as a result of future legislation, including the “Promoting American National Security and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act of 2019” that was passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on December 11, 2019. The bill includes significant new sanction provisions targeted at Turkey that, if enacted, would directly affect Lockheed Martin programs in Turkey. Turkey could implement retaliatory sanctions if the bill moves forward in Congress in 2020.We are monitoring these developments and the potential impacts of any sanctions and other actions regarding Turkey on the F-35 program and on our other programs involving Turkey. Depending on the scope and applicability of any sanctions or other actions, the impact could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or cash flows. Turkey is one of eight international partner countries on the F-35 program and previously committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, of which six have completed production.Turkish suppliers also produce component parts for the F-35 program, many of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and ensure continuity of F-35 production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for the component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress toward this end but due to the procedure to qualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. We are in discussions with the U.S. Government with respect to the timeline for the transition of Turkish sources. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk but final resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, including in 2020, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost. International sales of the F-35 are negotiated between the U.S. Government and international governments and the process to formally remove Turkey from the F-35 program is a government-to-government matter. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to delivery of F-35 aircraft to Turkey and the export and import of component parts from the Turkish supply chain. The full effects of potential U.S. Government sanctions on Turkey and Turkey’s removal from the F-35 program cannot be determined at this time. However, these actions could impact the timing of orders, disrupt the production of aircraft, delay delivery of aircraft, disrupt delivery of sustainment components produced in Turkey and impact funding on the F-35 program to include the result of any reprogramming of funds that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of alternate sources for component parts made in Turkey. While, in the case of the F-35 program, we expect that these costs ultimately would be recovered from the U.S. Government, the availability or timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. For additional discussion, including the risk of sanctions on other programs involving sales to Turkey or work with Turkish industry, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partner countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.30Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations Our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2019 2018 2017Net sales $59,812 $53,762 $49,960Cost of sales (51,445) (46,488) (43,589)Gross profit 8,367 7,274 6,371Other income, net 178 60 373Operating profit (a)(b)(c)(d) 8,545 7,334 6,744Interest expense (653) (668) (651)Other non-operating expense, net (651) (828) (847)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 7,241 5,838 5,246Income tax expense (e)(f) (1,011) (792) (3,356)Net earnings from continuing operations 6,230 5,046 1,890Net earnings from discontinued operations — — 73Net earnings $6,230 $5,046 $1,963Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $21.95 $17.59 $6.50Discontinued operations — — 0.25Total diluted earnings per common share $21.95 $17.59 $6.75(a) For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating profit includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. (b) For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating profit includes $96 million of severance and restructuring charges. See “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of 2018 severance and restructuring charges.(c) For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $51 million and $198 million related to properties sold in 2015.(d) For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating profit includes a gain of $34 million for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business.(e) In 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(f) Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 include benefits of $127 million ($0.45 per share) for additional tax deductions for the prior year, primarily attributable to foreign derived intangible income treatment based on proposed tax regulations released on March 4, 2019 and our change in tax accounting method. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 include benefits of $146 million ($0.51 per share) for additional tax deductions for the prior year, primarily attributable to true-ups to the net one-time charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 and our change in tax accounting method. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.31Table of ContentsNet SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Products $50,053 $45,005 $42,502 % of total net sales 83.7% 83.7% 85.1%Services 9,759 8,757 7,458 % of total net sales 16.3% 16.3% 14.9%Total net sales $59,812 $53,762 $49,960 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Product Sales Product sales increased $5.0 billion, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher product sales of $2.1 billion at Aeronautics, $1.5 billion at MFC and $965 million at Space. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and higher volume on classified programs. The increase in product sales at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missile programs (primarily precision fires, new hypersonic development programs, and classified programs), increased volume for integrated air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD), and increased volume for sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache). The increase in product sales at Space was primarily due to higher volume for government satellite programs (primarily Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) and Global Positioning System (GPS III)) and higher volume for strategic and missile defense programs (primarily new hypersonic development programs).Service SalesService sales increased $1.0 billion, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $385 million at RMS, $340 million at Aeronautics and $190 million at MFC. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily due to higher volume of various training and logistics solutions programs (primarily an army sustainment program), and integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs (primarily Aegis Combat System (Aegis)). Higher service sales at Aeronautics were primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-22 programs. The increase in service sales at MFC was primarily attributable to increased volume for sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS)) and higher sustainment volume for the PAC-3 program. 32Table of ContentsCost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Cost of sales – products $(44,589) $(40,293) $(38,417) % of product sales 89.1% 89.5% 90.4%Cost of sales – services (8,731) (7,738) (6,673) % of service sales 89.5% 88.4% 89.5%Severance and restructuring charges — (96) — Other unallocated, net 1,875 1,639 1,501 Total cost of sales $(51,445) $(46,488) $(43,589) The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product CostsProduct costs increased approximately $4.3 billion, or 11%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher product costs of approximately $1.9 billion at Aeronautics, $1.3 billion at MFC and $750 million at Space. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and higher volume on classified programs. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missile programs (primarily precision fires, classified programs and new hypersonic missile programs), contract mix and increased volume for integrated air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD) and increased volume for sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache). The increase in product costs at Space was primarily attributable to higher volume for government satellite programs (primarily Next Gen OPIR and GPS III) and strategic and missile defense programs (primarily new hypersonic development programs).Service CostsService costs increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 13%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher service costs of approximately $385 million at RMS, $315 million at Aeronautics and $195 million at MFC. The increase in service costs at RMS was primarily due to increased volume for various training and logistics solutions programs and IWSS programs (primarily Aegis). Higher service costs at Aeronautics were primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-22 programs. The increase in service costs at MFC was primarily attributable to increased volume for sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily SOF GLSS) and higher sustainment volume for the PAC-3 program.Restructuring ChargesDuring 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after-tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at our RMS business segment. As of December 31, 2019, we have paid substantially all of the severance payments associated with these actions. In addition, we have recovered a significant portion of these payments through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers, which are included in RMS’ operating results. Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $1.9 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. The increase in net reduction in expense from 2019 to 2018 was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $2.0 billion in 2019 and $1.8 billion in 2018, and fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, 33Table of Contentsnone of which were individually significant. See “Business Segment Results of Operations” and “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our pension cost.Other Income, NetOther income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. Other income, net in 2019 was $178 million, compared to $60 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the recognition in 2019 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $51 million ($38 million, or $0.13 per share, after-tax) related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations, the recognition in 2019 of a $34 million gain (approximately $0 after-tax) for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business, and the recognition in 2018 of a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) related to our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC). These increases were partially offset by lower earnings generated by equity method investees.As of December 31, 2019, our equity method investment in AMMROC totaled approximately $435 million. We are continuing to monitor this investment in light of ongoing performance, business base and economic issues, and we may have to record our portion of additional charges, or an impairment of our investment, or both, should the carrying value of our investment exceed its fair value. Substantially all of AMMROC’s current business is dependent on one contract that is currently up for re-competition and if AMMROC is not successful in securing such business on favorable terms or at all, the carrying value of our investment would be adversely affected. These charges could adversely affect our results of operations.Interest ExpenseInterest expense in 2019 was $653 million, compared to $668 million in 2018. The decrease in interest expense in 2019 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $750 million of debt during 2018. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.Other Non-Operating Expense, NetOther non-operating expense, net primarily includes the non-service cost components of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits). Other non-operating expense, net in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to a reduction in non-service FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans.Income Tax ExpenseOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 14.0% for 2019 and 13.6% for 2018. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.We recognized a tax benefit of $220 million in 2019 and $61 million in 2018 related to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the Tax Act, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 3.0 percentage points and 1.0 percentage points, respectively. The rate for 2019 benefited from $98 million in additional tax deductions for the prior year, primarily due to proposed tax regulations released on March 4, 2019. We also recognized a tax benefit of $15 million in 2019 and $61 million in 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.2 and 1.0 percentage points respectively, from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 Court of Federal Claims decision, which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets’ disposition. The rates for 2019 and 2018 benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points in 2019 and 2.4 percentage points in 2018. In addition, the rates for 2019 and 2018 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $63 million, and $55 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.9 percentage points for both 2019 and 2018.Changes in U.S. federal or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, including the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. The amount 34Table of Contentsof net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. Net Earnings We reported net earnings of $6.2 billion ($21.95 per share) in 2019 and $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018. Both net earnings and earnings per share were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 1 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Business segment operating profit also excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts under CAS or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance and restructuring actions (see “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), gains or losses from significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2019 and 2018, we have a favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment.35Table of ContentsSummary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Net sales Aeronautics $23,693 $21,242 $19,410Missiles and Fire Control 10,131 8,462 7,282Rotary and Mission Systems 15,128 14,250 13,663Space 10,860 9,808 9,605Total net sales $59,812 $53,762 $49,960Operating profit Aeronautics $2,521 $2,272 $2,176Missiles and Fire Control 1,441 1,248 1,034Rotary and Mission Systems 1,421 1,302 902Space 1,191 1,055 980Total business segment operating profit 6,574 5,877 5,092Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment (a) 2,049 1,803 1,613Stock-based compensation (189) (173) (158)Severance and restructuring charges (b) — (96) —Other, net (c) 111 (77) 197Total unallocated, net 1,971 1,457 1,652Total consolidated operating profit $8,545 $7,334 $6,744(a) The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total pension costs recoverable on U.S. Government contracts as determined in accordance with CAS. For a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and the total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, see the table below. (b) See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance and restructuring charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (c) Other, net in 2019 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $51 million related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations and a gain of $34 million for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business. Other, net in 2018 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Other, net in 2017 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations and a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).Total net FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension expense, were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Total FAS expense and CAS costs FAS pension expense $(1,093) $(1,431) $(1,372)Less: CAS pension cost 2,565 2,433 2,248Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment $1,472 $1,002 $876 Service and non-service cost reconciliation FAS pension service cost (516) (630) (635)Less: CAS pension cost 2,565 2,433 2,248FAS/CAS operating adjustment 2,049 1,803 1,613Non-operating FAS pension expense (a) (577) (801) (737)Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment $1,472 $1,002 $876(a) We record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The non-service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $116 million, $67 million, and $109 million for the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017.36Table of ContentsWe recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both service and non-service).The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $144.0 billion and $130.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $94.5 billion at December 31, 2019.Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. 37Table of ContentsIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. As previously disclosed, we are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2019, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program and recorded a charge of approximately $60 million ($47 million, or $0.17 per share, after-tax) at our RMS business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $205 million on this program as of December 31, 2019. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition. As previously disclosed, we have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers – intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the EADGE-T contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million, or $0.25 per share, after-tax) at our Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. As of December 31, 2019, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. We continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition. As previously disclosed, we have two commercial satellite programs at our Space business segment for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These programs are for the delivery of three satellites in total, including one that launched in February 2019 and one that launched in April 2019. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. As of December 31, 2019, cumulative losses remained at approximately $410 million for these programs. While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur unrecoverable general and administrative costs each period until we complete the contract for the third satellite. We have launched two satellites from one program, and the third satellite has completed development and has been shipped to the launch site for a planned launch in the first quarter of 2020. Any new satellite anomalies discovered during launch preparation requiring repair or rework, or prolonged on orbit testing prior to customer handover, could require that we record additional loss reserves, which could be material to our operating results.As previously disclosed, we are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. In 2018, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22 per share, after-tax) at our MFC business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program at December 31, 2019. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional reserves. However, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion in both 2019 and 2018. The consolidated net adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 were comparable primarily due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at Space offset by decreases in the other three business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2019 are inclusive of approximately $930 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, the F-16 program at Aeronautics, performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC and government satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2018 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which 38Table of Contentsinclude reserves for performance matters on the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program at MFC, various programs at RMS, and commercial satellite programs at Space.Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $23,693 $21,242 $19,410 Operating profit 2,521 2,272 2,176 Operating margin 10.6% 10.7% 11.2%Backlog at year-end $55,636 $55,601 $35,692 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2019 increased $2.5 billion, or 12%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $2.0 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production, sustainment and development contracts; and about $350 million for higher volume on classified programs. Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2019 increased $249 million, or 11%, compared to 2018. Operating profit increased approximately $210 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production, sustainment and development contracts; and about $50 million for the F-16 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $20 million on the F-22 program due to lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $25 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018.BacklogBacklog in 2019 was comparable to 2018.TrendsWe expect Aeronautics’ 2020 net sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage range from 2019 levels driven by increased volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range above 2019 levels. Operating profit margin for 2020 is expected to be slightly higher than 2019 levels.Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Javelin, Apache, SNIPER®, LANTIRN and SOF GLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $10,131 $8,462 $7,282 Operating profit 1,441 1,248 1,034 Operating margin 14.2% 14.7% 14.2%Backlog at year-end $25,796 $21,363 $17,729 MFC’s net sales in 2019 increased $1.7 billion, or 20%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $940 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily precision fires, new hypersonic development programs, and classified development programs); about $465 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD); and about $300 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily SOF GLSS and Apache).MFC’s operating profit in 2019 increased $193 million, or 15%, compared to 2018. Operating profit increased approximately $100 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher volume and higher risk retirements (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD); and about $60 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily precision fires), 39Table of Contentspartially offset by lower risk retirements (primarily Hellfire and Javelin). Operating profit on sensors and global sustainment programs was comparable as higher volume (primarily Apache and SOF GLSS) was offset by lower risk retirements (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER), after a net decrease in charges of $55 million on international military programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $30 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018.BacklogBacklog increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher orders on THAAD, PAC-3 and precision fires programs.TrendsWe expect MFC’s 2020 net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range in 2020 as compared to 2019 driven by higher volume in the tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense businesses, partially offset by a decrease in sales as a result of the divestiture of our Distributed Energy Solutions business. Operating profit is expected to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2020 as compared to 2019 driven by the increase in sales volume. Operating profit margin for 2020 is expected to be slightly lower than 2019 levels.Rotary and Mission Systems Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis, CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, LCS, VH-92A helicopter program, and the C2BMC contract. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $15,128 $14,250 $13,663 Operating profit 1,421 1,302 902 Operating margin 9.4% 9.1% 6.6%Backlog at year-end $34,296 $31,320 $30,030 RMS’ net sales in 2019 increased $878 million, or 6%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $535 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily LCS, radar surveillance systems programs, Multi Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), and Aegis); about $290 million for various training and logistics (TLS) programs due to higher volume (primarily an army sustainment program); and about $200 million for various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) programs due to higher volume (primarily undersea combat systems and cyber solutions programs). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $145 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower volume (primarily Black Hawk production, mission systems programs, and commercial aircraft).RMS’ operating profit in 2019 increased $119 million, or 9%, compared to 2018. Operating profit increased approximately $105 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs primarily due to better cost performance across the portfolio, customer mix, and higher risk retirements; and about $55 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily radar surveillance systems programs, LCS, and Aegis), after $50 million in charges in the first quarter of 2019 for a ground-based radar program. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $50 million for TLS programs due to $80 million in charges primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for an army sustainment program partially offset by lower charges on various other programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $65 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018.BacklogBacklog increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher orders on IWSS programs.TrendsWe expect RMS’ 2020 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range above 2019 levels driven primarily by Sikorsky. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the mid-single digit range above 2019 levels driven by the increase in sales 40Table of Contentsvolume. Operating profit margin for 2020 is expected to be slightly higher than 2019 levels.Space Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and hypersonics. Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $10,860 $9,808 $9,605 Operating profit 1,191 1,055 980 Operating margin 11.0% 10.8% 10.2%Backlog at year-end $28,253 $22,184 $22,042 Space’s net sales in 2019 increased $1.1 billion, or 11%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $690 million for government satellite programs due to higher volume (primarily Next Gen OPIR, GPS III and government satellite services); and about $355 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily new hypersonic development programs).Space’s operating profit in 2019 increased $136 million, or 13%, compared to 2018. Operating profit increased approximately $125 million for government satellite programs due to higher risk retirements (primarily AEHF) and higher volume (primarily GPS III and government satellite services); and about $45 million for commercial satellite programs, which reflect a lower amount of charges recorded for performance matters. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $65 million due to lower equity earnings for ULA. Operating profit on strategic and missile defense programs was comparable as higher volume (primarily hypersonic development programs) was offset by lower risk retirements (primarily missile defense programs). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $120 million higher in 2019 compared to 2018.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $145 million and $210 million, or 12% and 20% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2019 and 2018. BacklogBacklog increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to new orders in strategic and missile defense (hypersonic development programs and AWE) and space transportation (Orion).TrendsWe expect Space’s 2020 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range from 2019 levels largely driven by hypersonics. Operating profit in 2020 is expected to decrease in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2019 driven by lower profit rate adjustments in government satellites and lower equity earnings in 2020 compared to 2019. As a result, operating profit margin in 2020 is expected to decrease from 2019 levels.Liquidity and Cash FlowsWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments; returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases; and actively managed our debt levels and maturities, interest rates, and pension obligations. 41Table of ContentsWe have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2019. First, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.40 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below for a discussion on financial resources available to us, including the issuance of commercial paper. We made discretionary contributions of $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019 using cash on hand. We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. We do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2020.Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 39% of the sales we recorded in 2019, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2019 and those planned for 2020 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $772 $2,861 $1,837Operating activities Net earnings 6,230 5,046 1,963Non-cash adjustments 1,549 1,186 4,530Changes in working capital (672) (1,401) (427)Other, net 204 (1,693) 410Net cash provided by operating activities 7,311 3,138 6,476Net cash used for investing activities (1,241) (1,075) (1,147)Net cash used for financing activities (5,328) (4,152) (4,305)Net change in cash and cash equivalents 742 (2,089) 1,024Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $1,514 $772 $2,86142Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $4.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a reduction in cash contributions made to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and an improvement in cash used for working capital, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes. During 2019, we made cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $1.0 billion compared to $5.0 billion in 2018. The $729 million improvement in cash flows used for working capital (defined as receivables, contract assets, and inventories less accounts payable and contract liabilities) was primarily attributable to timing of production and billing cycles affecting contract assets (primarily the F-35 program) and contract liabilities (primarily C-130 program at Aeronautics and IWSS programs at RMS), partially offset by the timing of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics) and growth in inventories (primarily classified programs at Aeronautics and Sikorsky at RMS). We made net cash tax payments of approximately $940 million in 2019 compared to receiving net tax refunds of approximately $41 million in 2018.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities increased $166 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by net cash proceeds from various divestitures and acquisitions, and cash received for various other items, none of which were individually significant. Capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities increased $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by net repayments of $600 million for commercial paper in 2019 compared to net proceeds received of $600 million of commercial paper in 2018.In November 2019, we repaid $900 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.25% according to their scheduled maturities. In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We paid dividends totaling $2.6 billion ($9.00 per share) in 2019 and $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018.We paid quarterly dividends of $2.20 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2019 and $2.40 per share during the fourth quarter of 2019. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018.We paid $1.2 billion to repurchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock during 2019, which includes the $350 million paid to repurchase 916,249 shares pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement entered into during the fourth quarter. We paid $1.5 billion to repurchase 4.7 million shares of our common stock during 2018. See “Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our repurchases of common stock.Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2019, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $12.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.3 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, which are scheduled to mature in November 2020. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $900 million was composed of a scheduled debt maturity due in November 2019 and $600 million was composed of commercial paper with a weighted-average rate of 2.89% outstanding, all of which were repaid during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities 43Table of Contentsof our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. We sold approximately $387 million in 2019 and $532 million in 2018 of customer receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.Revolving Credit FacilitiesAt December 31, 2019, we had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks that is available for general corporate purposes. Effective August 24, 2019, we extended the expiration date of the 5-year Facility from August 24, 2023 to August 24, 2024. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility also serves as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of our commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount of the 5-year Facility. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the 5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement.Long-Term DebtIn November 2019, we repaid $900 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.25% according to their scheduled maturities. In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year and began on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.Total EquityOur total equity was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to net earnings of $6.2 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $908 million, and employee stock activity of $486 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, issuances of shares under the employee stock ownership plan and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $2.2 billion, the repurchase of 3.5 million common shares for $1.2 billion; and dividends declared of $2.6 billion during the year. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $713 million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2019.44Table of ContentsContractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2019, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Total debt (a) $13,799 $1,250 $906 $786 $10,857Interest payments 9,277 571 1,048 979 6,679Other liabilities 2,914 252 567 400 1,695Operating lease obligations 1,287 280 344 217 446Purchase obligations: Operating activities 55,491 28,564 22,528 3,483 916Capital expenditures 839 446 309 84 —Total contractual cash obligations $83,607 $31,363$25,702$5,949$20,593(a) Total debt excludes approximately $15 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture as we do not guarantee the debt.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2019. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $49.9 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2019, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $15.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2049. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2019 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019, in the 45Table of Contentsevent we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2019, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than1 Year Years2 and 3 Years4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $2,233 $1,030 $779 $298 $126Surety bonds 359 350 9 — —Third-party Guarantees 996 199 317 151 329Total commitments $3,588 $1,579 $1,105 $449 $455(a) Approximately $725 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $456 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $225 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2019, third-party guarantees totaled $996 million, of which approximately 76% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales RecognitionThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.46Table of ContentsWe account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.47Table of ContentsFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.48Table of ContentsPostretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. We completed the final step of the previously announced planned freeze of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees effective January 1, 2020. The freeze took effect in two stages. Effective January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen. Effective January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula was frozen. As a result of these changes, the qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020. With the freeze complete, the majority of our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.We may from time to time take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into additional transactions involving the purchase of a group annuity contract for a portion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. During December 2019, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.9 billion to transfer $1.9 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 20,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2019 for the affected pension plans were less than the plans’ service and interest cost in 2019. Accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2019 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost, and the difference of approximately $45 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to FAS pension expense in future periods. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional buy out contracts in future years and the amounts involved could be material to a particular reporting period. Future transactions could result in a non-cash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.Also, during December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, purchased two contracts from insurance companies for $2.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. One of the contracts we purchased was an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract), which relieved us of all responsibility for the pension obligations related to approximately 32,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The second contract was structured as a buy-in contract (that will reimburse the pension plan for all future benefit payments related to defined benefit obligations for approximately 9,000 U.S retirees and beneficiaries). The buy-in contract is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.Actuarial AssumptionsThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit 49Table of Contentscost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 3.25% at December 31, 2019, compared to 4.25% at December 31, 2018. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 3.25% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2019, compared to 4.25% at December 31, 2018. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 resulted in an approximate $5.8 billion increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at December 31, 2019 compared to 7.00% for December 31, 2018. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2019 of $6.7 billion based on an actual rate of approximately 21% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our 7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.In October 2019, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised assumptions in our December 31, 2019 re-measurement of benefit obligation. We reflected a longevity basis specific to the demographics of the underlying population (e.g., the nature of the work), versus the prior basis which was blended for all types of work, resulting in an approximate $860 million increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $15.5 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2019. This amortization period extended (approximately doubled from the prior nine years) in 2020 due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. During 2019, $908 million of these amounts were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $441 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2020. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 3.25% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2019, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2019 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 3.25% discount rate at December 31, 2019 that was used to compute the expected 2020 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2020 would be lower or higher by approximately $15 million. The impact of changes in the discount rate on FAS pension expense is significantly less than in prior years (i.e., $15 million for 2020 compared to $120 million for 2019) due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans effective January 1, 2020, and resulting service cost reduction and extended loss amortization period discussed above. If the 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2019 that was used to compute the expected 2020 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2020 would be lower or higher by approximately $80 million. Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 50Table of Contentsimpacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2019 between our actual rate of return of approximately 21% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.00% impacted 2020 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $15 million.Funding ConsiderationsWe made contributions of $1.0 billion in 2019 and $5.0 billion in 2018 to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 82% and 81% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018; which is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. The CAS rules fully transitioned in 2017 to better align the recovery of pension costs with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). We recovered $2.6 billion in 2019 and $2.4 billion in 2018 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $8.5 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.TrendsWe made contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $1.0 billion in 2019 and $5.0 billion in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2020. We anticipate recovering approximately $2.0 billion of CAS pension cost in 2020 allowing us to recoup a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.We project FAS pension income of $115 million in 2020, compared to FAS pension expense of $1.1 billion in 2019, as a result of completing the planned freeze of our salaried pension plans effective January 1, 2020 that was previously announced on July 1, 2014. Our FAS pension expense is comprised of service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credit, and amortization of actuarial losses. The service cost and amortization of actuarial losses components of FAS pension expense are significantly lower due to the freeze. As a result, the expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit exceed all other FAS pension expense components in 2020.Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $810 million and $864 million. We have recorded assets totaling $703 million and $750 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standards.We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” 51Table of Contentsincluded in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). This standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.52Table of ContentsGoodwill and Intangible AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. Our goodwill balance was $10.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2018. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 40%. While the margin between the fair value and carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit improved since the prior year impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by changes in expected future orders, discount rates and long term growth rates, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. 53Table of ContentsFinite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.The carrying value of our Sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of the Sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 10%. Additionally, our Sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2019. Any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).54Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and the outstanding principal amount was $13.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.2 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2019.We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $750 million and $1.3 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2019, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:44.524141
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2021,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The MD&A generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 7, 2020.We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2020, 74% of our $65.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 25% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, including through acquisitions, and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. COVID-19The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in March 2020 and has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to “shelter-in-place” and quarantine restrictions. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and support our community in addressing the challenges posed by this ongoing global pandemic. The pandemic has presented unprecedented business challenges, and we have experienced impacts in each of our business areas related to COVID-19, primarily in increased coronavirus-related costs, delays in supplier deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, site access and quarantine requirements, and the impacts of remote work and adjusted work schedules. Despite these challenges, Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Government’s pro-active efforts, especially with regard to the supply chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions caused by COVID-19 on our operations in 2020. In addition, favorable contract award timing, strong operational performance and lower travel and overhead expenditures due to COVID-19 restrictions partially offset the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial results in 2020. However, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, any potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services and our business are also difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future results of operations. For additional risks to the corporation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.32Table of Contents In accordance with the Department of Homeland Security’s identification of the Defense Industrial Base as a critical infrastructure sector in March 2020, our U.S. production facilities have continued to operate in support of essential products and services required to meet national security commitments to the U.S. Government and the U.S. military. Although we are designated as a critical infrastructure workforce, operations have been adjusted in response to the pandemic, including, most significantly, a reduction in the F-35 production rate primarily due to supplier delays. The reduction delayed 2020 F-35 deliveries by 18 aircraft. Due to the supplier delays, we implemented a temporary schedule adjustment for the F-35 production workforce in Fort Worth, Texas. While the F-35 production workforce resumed their pre-COVID-19 work schedule in the third quarter of 2020, staffing levels at our facilities, our customer facilities, and our supplier facilities have and could continue to fluctuate as a result of COVID-19, which could negatively impact our business. In addition, countries other than the U.S. have different responses to the pandemic that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Base closures, travel restrictions, and quarantine requirements both within and outside the U.S. have affected our normal operations and resulted in some schedule delays and future or prolonged occurrences of these could adversely affect our ability to achieve future contract milestones and our results of operations.The U.S. Government has taken actions in response to COVID-19 to increase the progress payment rates in new and existing contracts and accelerate contract awards to provide cash flow and liquidity for companies in the Defense Industrial Base, including large prime contractors like Lockheed Martin and smaller suppliers. We continue to proactively monitor our supply chain and have implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers within our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the DoD in changing the progress payment policy. We plan to continue to accelerate payments to the supply chain assuming the continuation of the current DoD progress payment policy in order to mitigate COVID-19 risks, prioritizing impacted suppliers and small businesses. As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.Our work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic, consistent with guidance from federal, state and local officials to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We have taken actions to equip employees with personal protective equipment, establish minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitize workspaces more frequently, adopt alternate work schedules and institute other measures aimed to sustain production and related services while minimizing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely, and a significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking. It remains uncertain when and on what scale teleworking employees will return to work in person. We have not previously experienced such a significant portion of our workforce working remotely for a prolonged period, so its effects on our long-term operations are unknown.Coronavirus-related costs for us and our suppliers are significant and we are seeking reimbursement of coronavirus-related costs under our U.S. Government contracts through a combination of equitable adjustments to the contract price and reimbursement of the costs under Section 3610 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which allows federal agencies to reimburse contractors at the minimum applicable contract billing rate for costs arising from certain paid leave, including sick leave a contractor provides to keep its employees or subcontractors in a ready state, as well as to protect the life and safety of government and contractor personnel from March 27, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Reimbursement of any costs under Section 3610 of the CARES Act increases sales, but is not expected to be at a profit or fee and so would have the effect of reducing our margins in future periods. These cost increases, including costs for employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely and for certain costs incurred prior to March 27, 2020, may not be fully recoverable under our contracts, particularly fixed-price contracts, or adequately covered by insurance. We also have no assurance that Congress will appropriate funds to cover the reimbursement of defense contractors authorized by the CARES Act, which could reduce funds available for other U.S. Government defense priorities. We also deferred certain payroll taxes in 2020 as provided for in the CARES Act, which has the effect of increasing our cash from operations in 2020, but reducing cash from operations in 2021 and 2022.We continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of COVID-19 and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.33Table of Contents 2021 Financial TrendsWe expect our 2021 net sales to increase by approximately 4% from 2020 levels. The projected growth is driven by increases across all four business areas. Specifically, the increased growth is driven by F-35, F-16 and classified programs at Aeronautics, increased volume within integrated air and missile defense at MFC, increased volume on Sikorsky helicopter program and training and logistics solutions programs at RMS, and hypersonics volume (including an acquisition of Integration Innovation Inc.’s (i3) hypersonics portfolio in November 2020) at Space. Total business segment operating margin in 2021 is expected to be approximately 11.0% and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $8.3 billion, net of $1.0 billion of planned pension contributions. The preliminary outlook for 2021 reflects the UK Ministry of Defense’s intent to re-nationalize the Atomic Weapons Establishment program (AWE program) on June 30, 2021. It does not incorporate the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. announced on December 20, 2020. The outlook for 2021 assumes continued support and funding of our programs, known impacts of COVID-19, and a statutory tax rate of 21%. Additionally, it assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S. Government will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2021 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.We expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021 based on a 2.50% discount rate (a 75 basis point decrease from the end of 2019), an approximate 16.5% return on plan assets in 2020, and a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, among other assumptions. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and anticipate recovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension cost. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.AcquisitionsOn December 20, 2020 we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $56 per share in cash, which is expected to be reduced to $51 per share after Aerojet Rocketdyne pays a pre-closing special dividend to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. This represents a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted basis, and a transaction value of approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s projected net cash balance. We expect to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and new debt issuances. The acquisition provides the corporation the opportunity to integrate Aerojet Rocketdyne’s propulsion systems more effectively into its products, generate cost and revenue synergies, and improve efficiencies in Aerojet Rocketdyne's production operations. The transaction will also allow customers incorporating Aerojet Rocketdyne products to offer more timely, innovative and affordable solutions, and reduce the prices paid by the U S. Government for systems it buys. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders. For risks related to the transaction, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. For more information regarding the acquisition terms, see Item 1.01 in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 21, 2020 for a description and copy of the merger agreement.Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we paid approximately $282 million for the acquisitions of Integration Innovation Inc.’s (i3) hypersonics portfolio and Allcomp Inc. The purchase price for each was allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. As a result, we recorded goodwill of $173 million at our Space business segment and $16 million at our Aeronautics business segment. The final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the respective acquisition date. The operating results of the businesses acquired have been included within our operating results since their respective acquisition dates. 34Table of Contents Industry ConsiderationsU.S. Government Funding On December 27, 2020, the President signed the fiscal year (FY) 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, providing annual funding for the DoD, other government agencies, and COVID-19 relief. The appropriations provide $741 billion in discretionary funding for national defense (includes DoD funding and defense-related spending in energy and water development, homeland security, and military construction appropriations), of which $671 billion is in base funding and $69 billion is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/emergency funding (OCO and emergency supplemental funding do not count toward discretionary spending caps). Of the $741 billion, the DoD was allocated $704 billion, composed of $635 billion in base funding and $69 billion in OCO and emergency funding. The appropriations adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019), which increased the spending limits for both defense and non-defense discretionary funds for the final two years (FY 2020 and FY 2021) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).The Appropriations Act also provides stimulus funds to individuals, businesses, and hospitals in response to the economic distress caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, it extends Section 3610 of the CARES Act until March 31, 2021, which gives DoD and federal agencies discretion to reimburse contractors for any paid leave, including sick leave, a contractor provides during the pandemic to keep its employees in a ready state.International BusinessA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.International customers accounted for 31% of Aeronautics’ 2020 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics received contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new F-16 aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to draw interest from various international customers, including a contract in 2020 from New Zealand.In 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Poland and Romania; and Apache and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) systems for Qatar.In 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program provides surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany and France. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70i Black Hawk® and MH-60 Seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Colombia, and Greece. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation. International customers accounted for 13% of Space’s 2020 net sales. The majority of our Space business segment international sales are from our majority share of AWE Management Limited (AWE), which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through 35Table of Contents component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning, and disposal. On November 2, 2020, the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD) announced its intention to re-nationalize the program on June 30, 2021. We are working with the MOD to transition operations.Status of the F-35 ProgramThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.During 2020, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 355,000 flight hours. During the second half of 2020, the U.S. Government awarded the production of 18 F-35 Block Buy aircraft in addition to the 448 aircraft previously awarded. Since program inception, we have delivered 611 production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. The first 611 F-35 aircraft delivered to U.S. and international customers include 438 F-35A variants, 128 F-35B variants, and 45 F-35C variants.During 2020, we delivered 120 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partner countries, and we have 356 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partner countries. In response to COVID-19 F-35 supplier delays and in conjunction with the F-35 Joint Program Office, we have tapered our production rate, and we anticipate resuming a pre-COVID-19 production rate in 2021. The delays resulted in 18 fewer deliveries than originally planned in 2020. See the discussion in Business Overview - COVID-19 and Item 1A, Risk Factors.As a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system, the U.S. Government removed Turkey from the F-35 program in 2019 and in December 2020 imposed sanctions on Turkey’s defense procurement agency (SSB) and certain of the agency’s officers under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The primary sanction imposed was a restriction on all new U.S. export licenses and authorizations for any goods or technology transferred to the SSB, but does not apply to current, valid export licenses and authorizations. Lockheed Martin expects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional sanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on our current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or cash flows.In addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers continue to produce component parts for the F-35 program, some of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and ensure continuity of F-35 production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for the component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress transitioning to non-Turkish suppliers, but due to the procedure to qualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. During 2020, the DoD publicly confirmed that Turkish suppliers would be permitted to provide certain components for the F-35 through 2022. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk, but final resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to completed Turkish aircraft and the export and import of component parts from the Turkish supply chain.The effects on the F-35 program of the U.S. Government sanctions on the SSB and Turkey’s removal from the F-35 program do not appear to be significant at this time. However, unforeseen actions could impact the timing of orders, disrupt the production of aircraft, delay delivery of aircraft, disrupt delivery of sustainment components produced in Turkey and impact funding on the F-35 program to include the result of any reprogramming of funds that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of alternate sources for component parts made in Turkey. While, in the case of the F-35 program, we expect that these costs ultimately would be recovered from the U.S. Government, the availability or timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. For additional discussion, including the risk of sanctions on other programs involving sales to Turkey or work with Turkish industry, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partner countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner 36Table of Contents performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.BacklogAt December 31, 2020, our backlog was $147.1 billion compared with $144.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Backlog at December 31, 2020 was reduced by $1.0 billion to reflect the impact of the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s intent to re-nationalize the AWE program on June 30, 2021. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 39% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $94.5 billion at December 31, 2019. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.37Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):202020192018Net sales$65,398 $59,812 $53,762 Cost of sales(56,744)(51,445)(46,488)Gross profit8,654 8,367 7,274 Other (expense) income, net(10)178 60 Operating profit (a)(b)(c)(d)8,644 8,545 7,334 Interest expense(591)(653)(668)Other non-operating income (expense), net182 (651)(828)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes8,235 7,241 5,838 Income tax expense (e)(1,347)(1,011)(792)Net earnings from continuing operations6,888 6,230 5,046 Net loss from discontinued operations (f)(55)— — Net earnings$6,833 $6,230 $5,046 Diluted earnings (loss) per common shareContinuing operations$24.50 $21.95 $17.59 Discontinued operations(0.20)— — Total diluted earnings per common share$24.30 $21.95 $17.59 (a)For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, operating profit include a non-cash asset impairment charge of $128 million and $110 million related to AMMROC.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating profit includes $96 million of severance and restructuring charges. (c)For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $51 million related to properties sold in 2015.(d)For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating profit includes a gain of $34 million for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business.(e)Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 include benefits of $127 million ($0.45 per share) for additional tax deductions for the prior year, primarily attributable to foreign derived intangible income treatment based on proposed tax regulations released on March 4, 2019 and our change in tax accounting method. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 include benefits of $146 million ($0.51 per share) for additional tax deductions for the prior year, primarily attributable to true-ups to the net one-time charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 and our change in tax accounting method. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 10 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(f)Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $55 million ($0.20 per share) non-cash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems & Global Solutions business divested in 2016.Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.38Table of Contents Net SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):202020192018Products$54,928 $50,053 $45,005 % of total net sales84.0 %83.7 %83.7 %Services10,470 9,759 8,757 % of total net sales16.0 %16.3 %16.3 %Total net sales$65,398 $59,812 $53,762 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Product Sales Product sales increased $4.9 billion, or 10%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to higher product sales of $2.0 billion at Aeronautics, $1.4 billion at MFC, $945 million at Space and $540 million at RMS. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and classified development contracts. The increase in product sales at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for integrated air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD) and tactical and strike missile programs (primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). The increase in product sales at Space was primarily due to higher volume for government satellite programs (primarily Next Gen OPIR) and strategic and missile defense programs (primarily hypersonic development programs). The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily Seahawk, VH-92A, and Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) production contracts), C6ISR programs (primarily on undersea combat systems programs), and integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs (primarily Aegis), partially offset by lower volume on various TLS programs.Service SalesService sales increased $711 million, or 7%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $565 million at Aeronautics and $325 million at RMS, partially offset by lower sales of $255 million at MFC. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-16 programs. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily a Seahawk sustainment program) and IWSS programs (primarily radar surveillance systems programs). The decrease in service sales at MFC was primarily due to lower volume on energy programs due to the divestiture of the Distributed Energy Solutions business, sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache sensors program), and integrated air and missile defense development programs (primarily PAC-3).39Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):202020192018Cost of sales – products$(48,996)$(44,589)$(40,293)% of product sales89.2 %89.1 %89.5 %Cost of sales – services(9,371)(8,731)(7,738)% of service sales89.5 %89.5 %88.4 %Severance charges(27)— (96)Other unallocated, net1,650 1,875 1,639 Total cost of sales$(56,744)$(51,445)$(46,488)The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product CostsProduct costs increased approximately $4.4 billion, or 10%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in product costs was primarily due to higher product costs of approximately $1.8 billion at Aeronautics, $1.2 billion at MFC, $1.0 billion at Space and $430 million at RMS. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35 program and classified contracts. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for integrated air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD) and tactical and strike missile programs (primarily GMLRS and HIMARS). The increase in product costs at Space was primarily due to increased volume for government satellite programs (primarily Next Gen OPIR) and strategic and missile defense programs (primarily hypersonic development programs). The increase in product costs at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily Seahawk, VH-92A, and CRH production contracts), C6ISR programs (primarily on undersea combat systems programs), and IWSS programs (primarily Aegis), partially offset by lower volume on various TLS programs.Service CostsService costs increased approximately $640 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in service costs was primarily due to higher service costs of approximately $485 million at Aeronautics and $245 million at RMS, partially offset by lower service costs of approximately $180 million at MFC. The increase in service costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the F-35 and F-16 programs. The increase in service costs at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily a Seahawk sustainment program) and IWSS programs (primarily radar surveillance systems programs), partially offset by charges for an army sustainment program in 2019 not repeated in 2020. The decrease in service costs at MFC was primarily due to lower volume on energy programs due to the divestiture of the Distributed Energy Solutions business, sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache sensors program), and integrated air and missile defense development programs (primarily PAC-3).Severance ChargesDuring 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below, stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.7 billion in 2020, compared to $1.9 billion in 2019. 40Table of Contents The decrease in net reduction in expense from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. See “Business Segment Results of Operations” and “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our pension cost.Other (Expense) Income, NetOther (expense) income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. Other expense, net in 2020 was $10 million, compared to other income, net of $178 million in 2019. Other expense, net in 2020 included a non-cash asset impairment charge of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) for our international equity method investee, AMMROC. Other income, net in 2019 included the recognition of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $51 million ($38 million, or $0.13 per share, after-tax) related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations and a $34 million gain (approximately $0 after-tax) for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business.In July 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in AMMROC to our joint venture partner for $307 million, subject to certain closing conditions. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying value of our investment to the selling price of $307 million, which resulted in the recognition of a noncash impairment charge of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) in our results of operations. The sale was completed on November 25, 2020. The purchase price is required to be paid in cash installments in 2021 and is guaranteed by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a third-party financial institution.Interest ExpenseInterest expense in 2020 was $591 million, compared to $653 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $900 million of debt during 2019. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 11 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes the non-service cost components of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan income (expense) (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits). Other non-operating income, net in 2020 was $182 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $651 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to a reduction in non-service FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The increase was primarily due to FAS pension income in 2020, compared to FAS pension expense in 2019, as a result of completing the planned freeze of our salaried pension plans effective January 1, 2020 that was previously announced on July 1, 2014.Income Tax ExpenseOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for 2020 and 14.0% for 2019. The rate for 2019 was lower than the rate for 2020 primarily due to $98 million additional tax deductions for 2018 attributable to foreign derived intangible income treatment, which lowered the rate 1.4%, and $51 million additional research and development credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.8%.The rates for both 2020 and 2019 benefited from additional tax deductions based on proposed tax regulations released on March 4, 2019, which clarified that foreign military sales qualify for foreign derived intangible income treatment. On July 9, 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department issued final tax regulations related to foreign derived intangible income. The final tax regulations confirm foreign military sales qualify for foreign derived intangible income treatment. The rates for 2020 and 2019 also benefited from the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the corporation’s defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and tax deductions for employee equity awards.On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which, along with earlier issued IRS guidance, provides for deferral of certain taxes. The CARES Act, among other things, also contains numerous other provisions which impact Lockheed Martin. The CARES Act and the projected annual financial impact of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020.41Table of Contents Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, including the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years. While it is possible that Congress may modify or repeal this provision before it takes effect and we continue to have ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that these provisions will be modified or repealed. Furthermore, we are continuing to work with our advisors to refine our legal interpretation of this provision prior to implementation in 2022. If these provisions are not repealed and based on current interpretations of the law, initially this would materially decrease our cash from operations based on current assumptions beginning in 2022 by approximately $2.0 billion; and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The largest impact would be on 2022 cash from operations, which would depend on the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 and other factors. The impact, however, would continue over the five year amortization period but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom). The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.Net Earnings from Continuing OperationsWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share) in 2020 and $6.2 billion ($21.95 per share) in 2019. Both net earnings and earnings per share were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 1.2 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.Net Loss from Discontinued OperationsIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) non-cash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems & Global Solutions business divested in 2016.Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Business segment operating profit also excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in 42Table of Contents accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension expense we have a favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment.Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 202020192018Net salesAeronautics$26,266 $23,693 $21,242 Missiles and Fire Control11,257 10,131 8,462 Rotary and Mission Systems15,995 15,128 14,250 Space11,880 10,860 9,808 Total net sales$65,398 $59,812 $53,762 Operating profitAeronautics$2,843 $2,521 $2,272 Missiles and Fire Control1,545 1,441 1,248 Rotary and Mission Systems1,615 1,421 1,302 Space1,149 1,191 1,055 Total business segment operating profit7,152 6,574 5,877 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment (a)1,876 2,049 1,803 Stock-based compensation(221)(189)(173) Severance and restructuring charges (b)(27)— (96)Other, net (c)(136)111 (77)Total unallocated, net1,492 1,971 1,457 Total consolidated operating profit$8,644 $8,545 $7,334 (a)The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense) and total pension costs recoverable on U.S. Government contracts as determined in accordance with CAS.

Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense) and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension income (expense) component is included in other non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense), we have a favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment.The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $147.1 billion and $144.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $94.5 billion at December 31, 2019. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.44Table of Contents Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.As previously disclosed, we are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2020, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program and recorded charges of approximately $45 million ($34 million, or $0.12 per share, after-tax) at our RMS business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $250 million on this program as of December 31, 2020. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition. As previously disclosed, we have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers – intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. As of December 31, 2020, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. We continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.As previously disclosed, we are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. As of December 31, 2020, cumulative losses remained at approximately $140 million on this program. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and may have to record additional reserves. However, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. The consolidated net adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased primarily due to decreases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space and MFC offset by an increase in Aeronautics and RMS. The consolidated net adjustments for 2020 are inclusive of approximately $745 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, government satellite programs at Space and performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC. The consolidated net adjustments for 2019 are inclusive of approximately $930 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, the F-16 program at Aeronautics, performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC and government satellite programs at Space.45Table of Contents Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 202020192018Net sales$26,266 $23,693 $21,242 Operating profit2,843 2,521 2,272 Operating margin10.8 %10.6 %10.7 %Backlog at year-end$56,551 $55,636 $55,601 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2020 increased $2.6 billion, or 11% compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.8 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on sustainment, production, and development contracts; about $450 million for higher volume on classified development contracts; and about $300 million for the F-16 program due to increased volume on international production and sustainment contracts.Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2020 increased $322 million, or 13%, compared to 2019. Operating profit increased approximately $240 million for the F-35 program due to higher volume and risk retirements on development and sustainment contracts and higher volume on production contracts; about $70 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and approximately $20 million for classified development contracts due to higher risk retirements. Operating profit on the F-16 program was comparable as higher volume was offset by lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $90 million higher in 2020 compared to 2019.BacklogBacklog increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher orders on F-16 production and various classified activities.TrendsWe expect Aeronautics’ 2021 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels driven by increased volume on F-35, F-16 and classified programs. Operating profit is expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percentage range above 2020 levels. Operating profit margin for 2021 is expected to be slightly higher than 2020 levels.Missiles and Fire ControlOur MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Javelin, Apache, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER®), LANTIRN and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS). MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):202020192018Net sales$11,257 $10,131 $8,462 Operating profit1,545 1,441 1,248 Operating margin13.7 %14.2 %14.7 %Backlog at year-end$29,183 $25,796 $21,363 MFC’s net sales in 2020 increased $1.1 billion, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $725 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (THAAD and PAC-3); and about $605 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily GMLRS, HIMARS, JASSM, and hypersonics). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $80 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume on the Apache sensors program; and about $120 million as a result of the divestiture of the Distributed Energy Solutions business. MFC’s operating profit in 2020 increased $104 million, or 7%, compared to 2019. Operating profit increased approximately $90 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily JASSM, hypersonics, 46Table of Contents GMLRS, and HIMARS); and approximately $30 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (THAAD and PAC-3), which was partially offset by lower risk retirements (THAAD and PAC-3). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $40 million for sensors and global sustainment programs primarily due to lower risk retirements and a reduction in the profit booking rate on the Apache sensors program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $40 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019.BacklogBacklog increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3 and tactical and strike missiles programs.TrendsWe expect MFC’s 2021 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels driven by higher volume in the integrated air and missile defense business, primarily PAC-3. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range above 2020 levels. Operating profit margin for 2021 is expected to be slightly lower than 2020 levels.Rotary and Mission Systems RMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions. RMS’ major programs include Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), Black Hawk® and Seahawk® helicopters, CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, Combat Rescue helicopter, VH-92A helicopter, and the C2BMC contract. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 202020192018Net sales$15,995 $15,128 $14,250 Operating profit1,615 1,421 1,302 Operating margin10.1 %9.4 %9.1 %Backlog at year-end$36,249 $34,296 $31,320 RMS’ net sales in 2020 increased $867 million, or 6%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $570 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher volume on production contracts (primarily Seahawk, VH-92A, CRH, and CH-53K), which was partially offset by lower volume on Black Hawk production programs; about $175 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily Aegis); and approximately $165 million for C6ISR programs due to higher volume (primarily undersea combat systems). These increases were partially offset by a $55 million decrease for various TLS programs due to lower volume.RMS’ operating profit in 2020 increased $194 million, or 14%, compared to 2019. Operating profit increased approximately $90 million for TLS programs due to $80 million in charges for an army sustainment program in 2019 not repeated in 2020; about $70 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs primarily due to higher volume on production contracts (primarily VH-92A, Seahawk, CRH, and CH-53K); and about $35 million for IWSS programs primarily due to higher volume and higher risk retirements on TPQ-53 and Advanced Hawkeye and lower charges on a ground-based radar program. Operating profit on C6ISR programs was comparable as higher volume was offset by lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $15 million higher in 2020 compared to 2019.BacklogBacklog increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher orders on Sikorsky programs.TrendsWe expect RMS’ 2021 net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels driven by higher volume on Sikorsky helicopter programs and TLS programs. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the low-single digit percentage range above 2020 levels. Operating profit margin for 2021 is expected to be in line with 2020 levels.47Table of Contents Space Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE program, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and hypersonics programs. Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions): 202020192018Net sales$11,880 $10,860 $9,808 Operating profit1,149 1,191 1,055 Operating margin9.7 %11.0 %10.8 %Backlog at year-end$25,148 $28,253 $22,184 Space’s net sales in 2020 increased $1.0 billion, or 9%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for government satellite programs due to higher volume (primarily Next Gen OPIR); and about $430 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development programs, inclusive of impacts due to the acquisition of i3's hypersonics portfolio in November 2020).Space’s operating profit in 2020 decreased $42 million, or 4%, compared to 2019. Operating profit decreased approximately $90 million for government satellite programs due to lower risk retirements on the various programs (primarily AEHF) that were partially offset by higher risk retirements and volume on the Next Gen OPIR program. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $40 million for commercial satellite programs due to charges recorded for performance matters in 2019 not repeated in 2020. Operating profit for strategic and missile defense programs was comparable as higher risk retirements and volume on hypersonic development programs were offset by lower risk retirements and volume on fleet ballistic missile programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $100 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $135 million and $145 million, or 12% of this business segment’s operating profit during both 2020 and 2019. BacklogBacklog decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. Additionally, backlog as of December 31, 2020 reflects a decrease due to the UK Ministry of Defense’s intent to assume 100% ownership of the program on June 30, 2021.TrendsWe expect Space’s 2021 net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels driven by higher volume on hypersonics programs and on government satellite programs (primarily Next Gen OPIR), partially offset by lower volume at AWE due to the UK Ministry of Defense’s intent to re-nationalize the program on June 30, 2021. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels. Operating profit margin for 2021 is expected to be lower than 2020 levels.Liquidity and Cash FlowsAs of December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $3.2 billion and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which is also available for borrowings in the event of a lack of short-term commercial paper availability. To date, the effects of COVID-19 have not had a significant negative impact on our liquidity, cash flows or capital resources. Actions taken by the U.S. Government to increase the rate of progress payments had the effect of increasing our cash from operations, but we used all of this benefit to accelerate payments to our suppliers. The effects of COVID-19 have, at times, led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which, depending on future 48Table of Contents developments, could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. The economic impacts of COVID-19 have also caused volatility in the equity capital markets and investment return on our pension assets. Changes in returns on plan assets may affect our plan funding, cash flows and stockholders’ equity. Differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (7.00% as of December 31, 2020) impact the measurement of the following year’s Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension expense and pension funding requirements.Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 40% of the sales we recorded in 2020, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments; returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases; and actively managed our debt levels and maturities, interest rates, and pension obligations. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2020. First, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.60 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $1.3 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below for a discussion on financial resources available to us, including the issuance of commercial paper.The majority of our capital expenditures for 2020 and those planned for 2021 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. We made discretionary contributions of $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in both 2020 and 2019 using cash on hand. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.The CARES Act, provides a deferral of payroll tax payments from which we benefited by deferring cash outlays of $460 million during 2020. This will have the effect of increasing cash outlays for payroll taxes during 2021 and 2022. The 49Table of Contents CARES Act, among other things, also contains numerous other provisions which may impact Lockheed Martin. We continue to review ongoing government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued.The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 202020192018Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year$1,514 $772 $2,861 Operating activitiesNet earnings6,833 6,230 5,046 Non-cash adjustments1,726 1,549 1,186 Changes in working capital101 (672)(1,401)Other, net(477)204 (1,693)Net cash provided by operating activities8,183 7,311 3,138 Net cash used for investing activities(2,010)(1,241)(1,075)Net cash used for financing activities(4,527)(5,328)(4,152)Net change in cash and cash equivalents1,646 742 (2,089)Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$3,160 $1,514 $772 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $872 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to cash generated from working capital in 2020 compared to a use of cash in 2019, and the deferral of tax payments. The $773 million improvement in cash flows related to working capital (defined as receivables, contract assets, and inventories less accounts payable and contract liabilities) was primarily attributable to timing of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics) and liquidation of inventories (primarily classified programs at Aeronautics and Sikorsky helicopter programs at RMS), partially offset by timing of production and billing cycles affecting contract assets and contract liabilities (primarily the F-35 program at Aeronautics). During 2020, we made net cash tax payments of approximately $1.4 billion compared to $940 million in 2019.In addition, net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 included the receipt of approximately $1.2 billion of net accelerated progress payments due to the U.S. Government's increase in the progress payment rate from 80% to 90%, and the deferral of $460 million for the employer portion of payroll taxes to 2021 and 2022 pursuant to the CARES Act. We used the accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government plus cash on hand to accelerate $2.1 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2020 that are due by their terms in future periods.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities increased $769 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and cash payments for various acquisitions, partially offset by net cash proceeds from various divestitures and acquisitions in 2019, and cash received for various other items, none of which were individually significant. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.5 billion in 2019. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities decreased $801 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to net repayments of $600 million for commercial paper in 2019 which did not recur in 2020, decreased repayments of long-term debt in 2020 and decreased repurchases of common stock, partially offset by higher dividend payments.In October 2020, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% due November 2020. In November 2019, we repaid $900 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.25% according to their scheduled maturities.On May 20, 2020, we received net cash proceeds of $1.1 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.85% Notes due in 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.80% 50Table of Contents Notes due in 2050. On June 16, 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering plus cash on hand to redeem $750 million of the outstanding $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2.50% Notes due in 2020 and $400 million of the outstanding $900 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.35% Notes due in 2021, each at their redemption price.For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 11 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We paid dividends totaling $2.8 billion ($9.80 per share) in 2020 and $2.6 billion ($9.00 per share) in 2019. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.40 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2020 and $2.60 per share during the fourth quarter of 2020. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.20 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2019 and $2.40 per share during the fourth quarter of 2019.We paid $1.1 billion to repurchase 3.0 million shares of our common stock during 2020, which includes the $500 million paid to repurchase 1.4 million shares pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement entered into in 2020. We paid $1.2 billion to repurchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock during 2019. See “Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our repurchases of common stock.Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2020, we held cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $12.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had $500 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, which are scheduled to mature in September 2021. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.3 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, which were scheduled to mature in November 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.Revolving Credit FacilitiesAt December 31, 2020, we had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the credit facility) with various banks that is available for general corporate purposes. Effective August 24, 2019, we extended the expiration date of the credit facility from August 24, 2023 to August 24, 2024. The undrawn portion of the credit facility also serves as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of our commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount of the credit facility. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the credit facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the credit facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year credit facility agreement.Long-Term DebtIn May 2020, we issued a total of $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.85% Notes due in 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.80% Notes due in 2050 (the “2050 Notes” and, together with the 2030 Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning on December 15, 2020. We may, at our option, redeem the Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or an applicable “make-whole” amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.51Table of Contents In June 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering plus cash on hand to redeem $750 million of the outstanding $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2.50% Notes due in 2020, and $400 million of the outstanding $900 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.35% Notes due in 2021 at their redemption price. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.In October 2020, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% due November 2020. In November 2019, we repaid $900 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.25% according to their scheduled maturities. In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.Total EquityOur total equity was $6.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.9 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net earnings of $6.8 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $440 million, and employee stock activity of $479 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, issuances of shares under the employee stock ownership plan and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.1 billion, dividends declared of $2.8 billion during the year, and the repurchase of 3.0 million common shares for $1.1 billion. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. During 2020, we repurchased $3.0 million of our common shares, which were recognized as a reduction to common stock for the par value with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital of $256 million and $841 million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.52Table of Contents Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2020, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By PeriodTotalLess Than1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Total debt$13,299 $500 $625 $1,060 $11,114 Interest payments9,382 554 1,067 989 6,772 Other liabilities 3,021 280 440 367 1,934 Operating lease obligations1,275 301 356 215 403 Purchase obligations:Operating activities50,728 26,852 19,735 3,930 211 Capital expenditures818 562 166 35 55 Total contractual cash obligations$78,523 $29,049 $22,389 $6,596 $20,489 The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2020. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $46.4 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2020, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $17.5 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2049. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2020 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2020, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.53Table of Contents We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By PeriodTotal CommitmentLess Than1 Year Years2 and 3Years4 and 5After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a)$2,136 $1,090 $559 $441 $46 Surety bonds357 357 — — — Third-party Guarantees871 605 4 220 42 Total commitments$3,364 $2,052 $563 $661 $88 (a)Approximately $859 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $219 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $264 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2020, third-party guarantees totaled $871 million, of which approximately 71% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales RecognitionThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same 54Table of Contents time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the 55Table of Contents performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.56Table of Contents Postretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.We completed the final step of the previously announced planned freeze of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees effective January 1, 2020. The freeze took effect in two stages. Effective January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen. Effective January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula was frozen. As a result of these changes, the qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020. With the freeze complete, the majority of our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.Similar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into additional transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. During December 2020, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.4 billion to transfer the related, outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2020 for the affected pension plans were less than the plans’ service and interest cost in 2020. A second contract was also purchased from an insurance company for $793 million that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries (referred to as a buy-in contract). The covered retirees and beneficiaries and buy-in contract were spun-off to the plan established in December 2018 for the contract purchased at that time similarly structured as a buy-in; the buy-in contracts are the sole assets of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract; effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation, while also providing the option to convert to a buy-out. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. These transactions had no impact on our 2020 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost. Since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts (both buy-in and buy-out) for approximately $6.7 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 77,000 retirees and beneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $55 million per year.We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional buy-out (and buy-in) contracts in future years. Future transactions could result in a non-cash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.57Table of Contents Actuarial AssumptionsThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.50% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at December 31, 2019. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.375% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at December 31, 2019. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020.We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2020 of $5.6 billion based on an actual rate of approximately 16.5% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our 7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.In October 2020, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised assumptions in our December 31, 2020 re-measurement of benefit obligation resulting in an approximate $426 million decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $16.2 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2020. This amortization period extended in 2020 due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. During 2020, $440 million of these amounts were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 2.50% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2020, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2020 by approximately $1.6 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.3 billion. If the 2.50% discount rate at December 31, 2020 that was used to compute the expected 2021 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2021 would be lower or higher by approximately $15 million. The impact of changes in the discount rate on FAS pension expense is significantly less than in years prior to the freeze of our salaried pension plans effective January 1, 2020 due to the resulting service cost reduction and extended loss amortization period discussed above. If the 7.00% expected long-term rate of 58Table of Contents return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2020 that was used to compute the expected 2021 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2021 would be lower or higher by approximately $80 million. Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2020 between our actual rate of return of approximately 16.5% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.00% impacted 2021 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $15 million.Funding ConsiderationsWe made contributions of $1.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019 to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 86% and 83% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019; which is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. The CAS rules fully transitioned in 2017 to better align the recovery of pension costs with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). We recovered $2.0 billion in 2020 and $2.6 billion in 2019 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.TrendsWe plan to make discretionary contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021. We anticipate recovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension cost in 2021 allowing us to recoup a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.We project FAS pension income of $265 million in 2021, compared to FAS pension income of $118 million in 2020, and a net 2021 FAS/CAS pension benefit of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2020. Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $789 million and $810 million. We have recorded assets totaling $685 million and $703 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts is expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 15 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and 59Table of Contents Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, has indicated it will work to re-establish a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water after a prior standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb) was challenged and withdrawn, and is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.If substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.We also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of compounds known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS). PFAS compounds have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing processes, and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g., Teflon, stain-resistant fabrics). Because we have used products and processes over the years containing some of those compounds, they likely exist as contaminants at many of our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are 60Table of Contents jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years.Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2019. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.61Table of Contents Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).62Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and the outstanding principal amount was $13.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2020.We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency transaction exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $572 million and $750 million. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 17 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2020, investments in the trust totaled $2.0 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020.63Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:25.102973
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2022,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The MD&A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021.Business OverviewWe are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner, with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities as well as growing our international sales. We invest substantially in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest in acquisitions, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic continued to present business challenges in 2021. We experienced impacts in each of our business areas related to COVID-19, primarily in continued increased coronavirus-related costs, delays in supplier deliveries, travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, employee absences, remote work and adjusted work schedules. During the first half of 2021, we had initiated a plan to reintroduce employees that had been working remotely to the workplace, however, we paused the reintroduction as COVID-19 cases rose in the second half of 2021. Attendance for employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We continued to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including encouraging employees to be vaccinated. We also continued to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions, including using accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and cash on hand to accelerate $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we expect to continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk assessed need through the end of 2022. Consistent with our current acceleration approach, we will prioritize small and COVID-19 impacted businesses.We are closely tracking developments regarding vaccine mandates. Currently, all personnel working at DoD facilities, including Lockheed Martin employees, must comply with DoD’s process to attest to vaccination status. Pursuant to the DoD mandate, this is required for physical access to DoD buildings and leased spaces in non-DoD buildings where official agency business is performed. Additionally, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021, pursuant to Executive Order 14042, referred to as the federal contractor vaccine mandate, all U.S. based employees of Lockheed Martin and most of its suppliers, industry partners and contractors working directly or indirectly on covered government contracts, or working at a facility where those contracts are performed, administered, or otherwise supported, were to be fully vaccinated, or have an 32Table of Contents approved medical or religious accommodation by January 18, 2022. This included employees who telework. Although the federal contractor vaccine mandate has been enjoined, we continue to encourage all employees to be vaccinated, including booster shots. We had taken steps to comply with the federal contractor vaccine mandate across our workforce until it was enjoined. As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been vaccinated or received an approved exception. If the mandate is reinstated, or new mandates implemented, it is uncertain to what extent compliance with any such vaccine mandates may result in adverse impacts such as workforce attrition for us or our suppliers or reduce morale or efficiency. If the adverse impact is significant for us or our suppliers, our operations and ability to execute on our contracts could be adversely affected.The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic-related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, including the implementation of any federal, state, local or foreign vaccine mandates, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future results and performance. 2022 Financial TrendsWe expect 2022 net sales to decrease by approximately 2% from 2021 levels. The projected decline is driven by declines at three of the four business areas (MFC, RMS, and Space). Specifically, these decreases are driven by the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Space, the 2021 delivery of a training system on an international pilot training program at RMS not projected to repeat in 2022, as well as a decrease in Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) volume at MFC due to withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Total business segment operating margin in 2022 is expected to be approximately 10.9% and cash from operations in 2022 is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.9 billion. Cash from operations assumes no pension contributions; and includes an estimated potential impact in 2022 of approximately $500 million from the provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect on January 1, 2022 eliminating the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requiring companies to amortize such expenditures over five years. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. See “Income Tax Expense” below and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding potential impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations, including the treatment of research and development costs.The outlook for 2022 also assumes continued support and funding of our programs, a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, known impacts of COVID-19, and the continued acceleration of supplier payments, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. No additional impacts to the company’s operations, supply chain, or financial results as a result of continued COVID-19 disruption have been incorporated into our outlook for 2022 as the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will continue to have. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our financial results remain uncertain and there can be no assurance that our underlying assumptions are correct. Additionally, the company’s outlook for 2022 assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S. Government will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. It also does not incorporate the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2022 net sales, business segment operating margin, and cash flows.We expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2022 based on a 2.875% discount rate (a 37.5 basis point increase from the end of 2020), an approximate 10.5% return on plan assets in 2021, and a 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, among other assumptions. We do not expect to make required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2022. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that 33Table of Contents no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.Renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment ProgramOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK’s nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly, the AWE program’s ongoing operations, including the entity that manages the program, are no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, AWE generated sales of $1.4 billion and operating profit of $35 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for 2020.Pending Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.On December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00 per share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted basis, and a transaction value of approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-projected net cash. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. The transaction was approved by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction, on September 24, 2021, we and Aerojet Rocketdyne each certified substantial compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a “second request.” On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. Under the terms of the merger agreement, either party may terminate the transaction if it has not closed on or before March 21, 2022. A copy of the merger agreement between the companies can be found in Lockheed Martin’s Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 21, 2020. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction. U.S. Government FundingOn May 28, 2021, the Administration submitted to Congress the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2022 budget request, which proposes $753 billion for total national defense spending including $715 billion for the DoD, a 1.6% increase above the FY 2021 enacted amounts for both total national defense and the DoD (a U.S. Government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30). This is the first budget over the past decade that is not restricted by the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The budget also proposes to end the use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) as a separate fund to finance overseas operations. On December 27, 2021, the President signed the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual policy bill that establishes, continues, or modifies federal programs, and provides the prerequisite for the Congress to appropriate budget authority for defense programs. The FY 2022 NDAA authorizes approximately $25 billion more than the President requested in the FY 2022 budget request. However, the U.S. Government has not yet enacted an annual budget for FY 2022. To avert a government shutdown, a series of continuing resolution funding measures have been enacted to finance all U.S. Government activities through February 18, 2022. Under the continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for FY 2021 are available, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Importantly, our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions or in the event of a government shutdown, we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our results of operations. In the coming months, Congress will need to approve or revise the President’s FY 2022 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy 34Table of Contents legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY 2022 budget to become law and complete the budget process.Additionally, on December 16, 2021, the President signed legislation increasing the federal debt limit by $2.5 trillion. The measure increases the debt limit to $31.4 trillion from the previous level of $28.9 trillion and is estimated to provide sufficient government borrowing capacity to last until early 2023.International BusinessA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2021, approximately 69% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 31% were DCS. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.In 2021, international customers accounted for 35% of Aeronautics’ net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new aircraft.In 2021, international customers accounted for 29% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Germany and Taiwan and for Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) from Australia.In 2021, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany and France. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70 Black Hawk® and MH-60 Seahawk® helicopters to international customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Greece. Additionally, in December 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to procure 12 CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation. In 2021, international customers accounted for 8% of Space’s net sales. The majority of our Space business segment international sales in 2021 were from our majority share of AWE Management Limited (AWE), which operated the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program until June 30, 2021. As previously announced, on June 30, 2021 the UK Ministry of Defence renationalized AWE and, accordingly, the AWE program’s ongoing operations are no longer included in our financial results beginning as of that date.Status of the F-35 ProgramThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.35Table of Contents During 2021, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 470,000 flight hours. During the second half of 2021, the U.S. Government awarded the production of 16 F-35 Lot 15 aircraft in addition to the 967 aircraft previously awarded. Since program inception, we have delivered 753 production F-35 aircraft to U.S. and international customers, including 549 F-35A variants, 150 F-35B variants, and 54 F-35C variants, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity.In response to COVID-19 F-35 delays and in conjunction with the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), we tapered our production rate in 2020. In 2021, we continued to be impacted by COVID-19 but the production rate improved from its 2020 levels. In September 2021, the F-35 JPO and the Lockheed Martin industry team agreed on an F-35 production rebaseline that ensures predictability and stability in the production process while recovering the aircraft shortfall realized over the last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. With this agreement, we were scheduled to deliver 133-139 aircraft in 2021. However, we delivered 142 aircraft in 2021, exceeding our contractual obligation by three aircraft. We anticipate delivering 148-153 aircraft in 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we anticipate delivering 156 aircraft for the foreseeable future. We have 230 aircraft in backlog as of December 31, 2021 extending into 2023, including orders from our international partner countries.Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include supplier, Lockheed Martin and partner performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, the receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, and the ability to continue to reduce the unit production costs and improve affordability.BacklogAt December 31, 2021, our backlog was $135.4 billion compared with $147.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 38% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.36Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):202120202019Net sales$67,044 $65,398 $59,812 Cost of sales(57,983)(56,744)(51,445)Gross profit9,061 8,654 8,367 Other income (expense), net62 (10)178 Operating profit9,123 8,644 8,545 Interest expense(569)(591)(653)Non-service FAS pension (expense) income(1,292)219 (577)Other non-operating income (expense), net288 (37)(74)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes7,550 8,235 7,241 Income tax expense(1,235)(1,347)(1,011)Net earnings from continuing operations6,315 6,888 6,230 Net loss from discontinued operations— (55)— Net earnings$6,315 $6,833 $6,230 Diluted earnings (loss) per common shareContinuing operations$22.76 $24.50 $21.95 Discontinued operations— (0.20)— Total diluted earnings per common share$22.76 $24.30 $21.95 Certain amounts reported in other income (expense), net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations.37Table of Contents Net SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):202120202019Products$56,435 $54,928 $50,053 % of total net sales84.2 %84.0 %83.7 %Services10,609 10,470 9,759 % of total net sales15.8 %16.0 %16.3 %Total net sales$67,044 $65,398 $59,812 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Product Sales Product sales increased $1.5 billion, or 3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately $735 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $465 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) programs; and $305 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts.Service SalesService sales increased $139 million, or 1%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to higher sales of approximately $180 million at Aeronautics due to higher sustainment volume on F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):202120202019Cost of sales – products$(50,273)$(48,996)$(44,589)% of product sales89.1 %89.2 %89.1 %Cost of sales – services(9,463)(9,371)(8,731)% of service sales89.2 %89.5 %89.5 %Severance and restructuring charges (36)(27)— Other unallocated, net1,789 1,650 1,875 Total cost of sales$(57,983)$(56,744)$(51,445)The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from COVID-19, we have not identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.38Table of Contents Product CostsProduct costs increased approximately $1.3 billion, or 3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.Service CostsService costs increased approximately $92 million, or 1%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in service costs was primarily due to higher service costs of approximately $85 million at Aeronautics due to higher sustainment volume on F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.Severance and Restructuring ChargesDuring 2021, we recorded severance and restructuring charges of $36 million ($28 million, or $0.10 per share, after-tax) associated with plans to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce total workforce within our RMS business segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021, compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. Other unallocated, net during 2021 was higher primarily due to an increase in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. See “Business Segment Results of Operations” and “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our pension cost.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net generally includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2021 was $62 million, compared to other expense, net of $10 million in 2020. Other income, net in 2021 included lower earnings generated by equity method investments; however, other expense, net in 2020 included a noncash impairment charge of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) related to our previous investment in Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC), which was sold in 2020. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Interest ExpenseInterest expense in 2021 was $569 million, compared to $591 million in 2020. The decrease in interest expense in 2021 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of debt in October 2020 and September 2021 of $500 million each. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 11 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) IncomeNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to income of $219 million in 2020. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. See “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.39Table of Contents Other Non-operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic investments in early stage companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating income, net in 2021 was $288 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $37 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.Income Tax ExpenseOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for both 2021 and 2020. The rates for both 2021 and 2020 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and tax deductions for employee equity awards.Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, including the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. Recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to increase our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify, or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, and we continue to have ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified, or repealed. Furthermore, in anticipation of the new provision taking effect, we have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to evaluate its application to our business. If this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, we estimate it will decrease our expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. While the largest impact will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.We are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom). The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.Net Earnings from Continuing OperationsWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share) in 2020. Both net earnings and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the factors mentioned above, including the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. Additionally, both net earnings and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues experienced on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.Net Loss from Discontinued OperationsIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems & Global Solutions business divested in 2016.40Table of Contents Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is our largest equity method investee.Business segment operating profit also excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities.Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.41Table of Contents Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 202120202019Net salesAeronautics$26,748 $26,266 $23,693 Missiles and Fire Control11,693 11,257 10,131 Rotary and Mission Systems16,789 15,995 15,128 Space11,814 11,880 10,860 Total net sales$67,044 $65,398 $59,812 Operating profitAeronautics$2,799 $2,843 $2,521 Missiles and Fire Control1,648 1,545 1,441 Rotary and Mission Systems1,798 1,615 1,421 Space1,134 1,149 1,191 Total business segment operating profit7,379 7,152 6,574 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,960 1,876 2,049 Stock-based compensation(227)(221)(189) Severance and restructuring charges (a)(36)(27)— Other, net (b)47 (136)111 Total unallocated, net1,744 1,492 1,971 Total consolidated operating profit$9,123 $8,644 $8,545 (a)See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Severance and Restructuring Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance and restructuring actions across our organization.(b)Other, net in 2020 includes a noncash impairment charge of $128 million recognized on our investment in the international equity method investee, AMMROC. Other, net in 2019 includes a previously deferred noncash gain of $51 million related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations and a gain of $34 million for the sale of our Distributed Energy Solutions business. (See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension (expense) income components are included in non-service FAS pension (expense) income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income, we have a favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment.42Table of Contents Our total net FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in millions):202120202019Total FAS (expense) income and CAS costsFAS pension (expense) income $(1,398)$118 $(1,093)Less: CAS pension cost2,066 1,977 2,565 Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment$668 $2,095 $1,472 Service and non-service cost reconciliationFAS pension service cost(106)(101)(516)Less: CAS pension cost2,066 1,977 2,565 FAS/CAS operating adjustment1,960 1,876 2,049 Non-service FAS pension (expense) income (1,292)219 (577)Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment$668 $2,095 $1,472 The decrease in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021 was principally driven by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) in connection with the transfer of $4.9 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company on August 3, 2021. See “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $135.4 billion and $147.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.43Table of Contents We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Lower than expected supply chain activity negatively affected our net sales during 2021.Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. The consolidated net adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 increased primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space, MFC and RMS offset by a decrease in Aeronautics. The consolidated net adjustments for 2021 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at Aeronautics, various programs at RMS and a commercial ground solutions program at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2020 are inclusive of approximately $745 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, government satellite programs at Space and performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC.We periodically experience performance issues and record losses for certain programs. For further discussion on certain programs at Aeronautics and RMS, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.44Table of Contents Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 202120202019Net sales$26,748 $26,266 $23,693 Operating profit2,799 2,843 2,521 Operating margin10.5 %10.8 %10.6 %Backlog at year-end$49,118 $56,551 $55,636 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021 increased $482 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $290 million on classified contracts due to higher volume; about $180 million for the F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower volume on development contracts; and about $30 million for the C-130 program primarily due to higher volume on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the second quarter of 2021 for performance issues experienced on a classified program that was partially offset by higher risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset by higher risk retirements and volume on sustainment contracts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for the F-16 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts and higher production volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.BacklogBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021. TrendsWe expect Aeronautics’ 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit range above 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021 levels.Missiles and Fire ControlOur MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER®), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21®) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS). MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):202120202019Net sales$11,693 $11,257 $10,131 Operating profit1,648 1,545 1,441 Operating margin14.1 %13.7 %14.2 %Backlog at year-end$27,021 $29,183 $25,796 45Table of Contents MFC’s net sales in 2021 increased $436 million, or 4%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $340 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily PAC-3); and about $215 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $90 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER® and Apache) that was partially offset by close out activities related to the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021.MFC’s operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.BacklogBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.TrendsWe expect MFC’s 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit range below 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to increase slightly from 2021 levels.Rotary and Mission Systems RMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions. RMS’ major programs include Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), Black Hawk® and Seahawk® helicopters, CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), VH-92A helicopter, and the C2BMC program. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions):202120202019Net sales$16,789 $15,995 $15,128 Operating profit1,798 1,615 1,421 Operating margin10.7 %10.1 %9.4 %Backlog at year-end$33,700 $36,249 $34,296 RMS’ net sales in 2021 increased $794 million, or 5%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $540 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher production volume (Black Hawk, CH-53K and CRH); and about $340 million for TLS programs primarily due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $65 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to lower volume on the LCS and TPQ-53 programs that were partially offset by higher volume on the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) and Aegis programs.RMS’ operating profit in 2021 increased $183 million, or 11%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $140 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher risk retirements (Black Hawk and CH-53K), higher production volume (Black Hawk and CRH), and lower charges on the CRH program in the first half of 2021; and about $10 million for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021. Operating profit for IWSS programs was comparable as lower risk retirements on the LCS program and lower volume on the TPQ-53 program were offset by higher volume on the CSC program and lower charges on a ground-based radar program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $80 million higher in 2021 compared 2020.46Table of Contents BacklogBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on Sikorsky programs.TrendsWe expect RMS’ 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by the delivery of a training system on an international pilot training program at RMS in 2021, as well as from lower volume on Black Hawk. Operating profit is expected to decline in the high-single digit range below 2021. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels.Space Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, hypersonics programs and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions):202120202019Net sales$11,814 $11,880 $10,860 Operating profit1,134 1,149 1,191 Operating margin9.6 %9.7 %11.0 %Backlog at year-end$25,516 $25,148 $28,253 Space’s net sales in 2021 decreased $66 million, or 1%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $535 million due to the renationalization of the AWE program; and about $105 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower volume (primarily Orion). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $405 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development and NGI programs); and about $140 million for national security space programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily Next Gen OPIR and SBIRS). Space’s operating profit in 2021 decreased $15 million, or 1%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $70 million of lower equity earnings from the company's investment in ULA due to lower launch volume and launch vehicle mix; and about $20 million due to the renationalization of the AWE program. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of about $35 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development programs); and approximately $25 million for national security space programs due to higher risk retirements (primarily SBIRS and classified programs) and higher volume (primarily Next Gen OPIR) that was partially offset by charges of about $80 million on a commercial ground solutions program. Operating profit was comparable for commercial civil space programs as higher risk retirements (primarily space transportation programs) were offset by lower volume (primarily Orion). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $100 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $65 million and $135 million, or 6% and 12%, of this business segment’s operating profit during 2021 and 2020. BacklogBacklog increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to multi-year contract awards in national security space (Next Gen OPIR) and strategic missile defense (Next Generation Interceptor). These backlog increases were partially offset by higher sales on hypersonic development programs and the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment.47Table of Contents TrendsWe expect Space’s 2022 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit levels from 2021 primarily driven by the renationalization of the AWE and lower volume on OPIR/SBIRS due to program lifecycles, partially offset by growth on the NGI program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single-digit level from 2021. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels. Liquidity and Cash FlowsAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2021, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. In March 2020, the DoD increased the percentage rate for certain progress payments from 80% to 90%. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, and our pension obligations. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. In September 2021, our Board of Directors increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.80 per share and approved a $5.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.As disclosed in the “Business Overview” section above, on December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-projected net cash and are awaiting a final FTC decision. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. Please see the “Business Overview” above for the status of the transaction.On August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding 48Table of Contents contribution was required by us. See “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. Future pension risk transfer transactions could also be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash pension settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period. To date, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier delays. The U.S. Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on public health, the economy, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses. Since the pandemic began, Lockheed Martin has remained committed to flowing down the benefits received from the DoD’s modification of the progress payment rate to our supply chain partners. As of December 31, 2021, we have received approximately $1.5 billion of net accelerated progress payments, the majority of which were in 2020. We continue to use accelerated progress payments and cash on hand to accelerate payments to our suppliers. As of December 31, 2021, we have accelerated $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we will continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk assessed need through the end of 2022. Consistent with our current acceleration approach, we will prioritize small and COVID-19 impacted businesses. On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) into law. ARPA eased funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension plans by extending the amortization of funding shortfalls and enhancing interest rate stabilization, which has the effect of reducing the funding requirements for our single-employer defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2021 and reducing the amount of CAS pension costs allocated to our U.S. Government contracts beginning in 2022. The lower pension contributions will be partially offset by lower tax deductions.The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 202120202019Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year$3,160 $1,514 $772 Operating activitiesNet earnings6,315 6,833 6,230 Noncash adjustments3,109 1,726 1,549 Changes in working capital9 101 (672)Other, net(212)(477)204 Net cash provided by operating activities9,221 8,183 7,311 Net cash used for investing activities(1,161)(2,010)(1,241)Net cash used for financing activities(7,616)(4,527)(5,328)Net change in cash and cash equivalents444 1,646 742 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$3,604 $3,160 $1,514 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to lower pension contributions, as we made no contributions in 2021 compared to a pension contribution of $1.0 billion in 2020, and an increase of approximately $865 million in cash from our net earnings adjusted for noncash items. These increases in cash from operations were partially offset by an increase of approximately $720 million in payroll taxes and an increase of about $100 million in accelerated payments to our supply chain. During 2021, we paid employer payroll taxes of $942 million, compared to $222 million during 2020. The increase in employer payroll taxes was due to the deferral of $460 million of payments in 2020, half of which were paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and half of which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022, pursuant to the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2021, we accelerated $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers that were due in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2.1 billion of payments to suppliers as of December 31, 2020 that were due in the first quarter of 2021. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020.Investing ActivitiesCash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments. The majority of our capital expenditures are for equipment and facilities 49Table of Contents infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.Net cash used for investing activities decreased $849 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in net cash used for investing activities is primarily attributable to proceeds of $307 million received in 2021 from the sale of our ownership interest in the AMMROC joint venture, cash payments of $282 million for various business acquisitions in 2020, and a decrease of $244 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in 2021, compared to $1.8 billion in 2020.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities increased $3.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock and higher dividend payments.During 2021, we paid $4.1 billion to repurchase 11.7 million shares of our common stock, of which 2.2 million shares were received upon settlement in January 2022. During 2020, we paid $1.1 billion to repurchase 3.0 million shares of our common stock.We paid dividends totaling $2.9 billion ($10.60 per share) in 2021 and $2.8 billion ($9.80 per share) in 2020. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.60 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2021 and $2.80 per share during the fourth quarter of 2021. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.40 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2020 and $2.60 per share during the fourth quarter of 2020.In September 2021, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.35% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2020, we received net cash proceeds of $1.1 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. In June 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering plus cash on hand to redeem $750 million of notes due in 2020 and $400 million of notes due in 2021, each at their redemption price.In October 2020, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% due in November 2020.Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2021, we held cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs was $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had $6 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, which are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. See “Note 11 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities.We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.50Table of Contents Contractual Commitments At December 31, 2021, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):TotalDue Within 1 YearTotal debt$12,799 $6 Interest payments8,827 537 Other liabilities 2,503 242 Operating lease obligations1,566 325 Purchase obligations:Operating activities56,923 25,139 Capital expenditures737 582 Total contractual cash obligations$83,355 $26,831 The table above includes debt presented gross of any unamortized discounts and issuance costs, but excludes the net unfunded obligation and estimated minimum funding requirements related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2021. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $52.8 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2021 and those planned for 2022 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2022 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2021 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway at Aeronautics to support classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of 51Table of Contents ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2021, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $17.0 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2021 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the contractual commitments table above. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2021, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Total CommitmentLess Than1 Year Standby letters of credit (a)$2,439 $1,035 Surety bonds342 319 Third-party Guarantees838 428 Total commitments$3,619 $1,782 (a)Approximately $781 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2021, third-party guarantees totaled $838 million, of which approximately 69% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales RecognitionThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., 52Table of Contents incentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.53Table of Contents For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.54Table of Contents Postretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.Similar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required by us. This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders’ equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected defined benefit pension plans as of the August 3, 2021 close date. The purchase of the GACs and the pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge. Inclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 95,000 retirees and beneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.Actuarial AssumptionsThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of FAS expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our 55Table of Contents retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.375% at December 31, 2020. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021.We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% at December 31, 2021 compared to 7.00% at December 31, 2020. We lowered our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets due to changes in our asset allocation targets. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2021 of $3.9 billion, based on an actual rate of approximately 10.5%, improved plan assets more than the $2.1 billion expected return based on our long-term rate of return assumption.In October 2021, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised assumptions in our December 31, 2021 re-measurement of benefit obligation resulting in an approximate $109 million increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $11.0 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2021. During 2021, $1.8 billion of these amounts were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.3 billion. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 2.875% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2021, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2021 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 2.875% discount rate at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $10 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $75 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2021 between our actual rate of return of approximately 10.5% and our expected long-term rate of return decreased (increased) 2022 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $15 million.Funding ConsiderationsWe made no contributions in 2021, compared to $1.0 billion in 2020, to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with ERISA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 92% and 82% as of 56Table of Contents December 31, 2021 and 2020; which is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP and reflects the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 discussed below.Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.We recovered $2.1 billion in 2021 and $2.0 billion in 2020 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $7.0 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eased funding requirements for single-employer defined benefit pension plans under ERISA, as amended, by restarting and extending the amortization of funding shortfalls and extending and enhancing interest rate stabilization percentages, among many other stimulus measures. These changes have the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements and CAS pension costs from what they otherwise would have been had the measures not been enacted.TrendsWe do not plan to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2022. We anticipate recovering approximately $1.8 billion of CAS pension cost in 2022 allowing us to recoup a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.We project FAS pension income of $460 million in 2022 compared to FAS pension income of $265 million in 2021 and a net 2022 FAS/CAS pension benefit of $2.3 billion, which is comparable to the $2.3 billion in 2021. This excludes the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion (pretax) recognized in the third quarter of 2021 described above for comparison year over year.Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $742 million and $789 million. We have recorded assets totaling $645 million and $685 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts is expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 15 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).57Table of Contents Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, has indicated it will work to re-establish a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water after a prior standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb) was challenged and withdrawn, and is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.If substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.We also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing processes, and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g., Teflon, stain-resistant fabrics). Because we have used products and processes over the years containing some of those compounds, they likely exist as contaminants at many of our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.58Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from five to 20 years.Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by its performance, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit remains at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.59Table of Contents Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed our annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).60Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and the outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021.We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4.0 billion and $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, investments in the trust totaled $2.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.61Table of Contents We are exposed to equity market risk through certain marketable securities held by our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund. The fair value of our marketable securities held by the fund was $132 million as of December 31, 2021. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2021 would not have a material impact on the carrying amounts of these securities or our consolidated financial statements. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the valuations and prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales.62Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:27.487605
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2023,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The MD&A generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on January 25, 2022.Business OverviewWe are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2022, 73% of our $66.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in a complex and evolving global security environment. Our strategy consists of the design and development of platforms and systems that meet the future requirements of 21st Century Security. Our vision for 21st Century Security is to accelerate the adoption of advanced networking and leading-edge technologies into our national defense enterprise, while enhancing the performance and value of our platforms and products for our customers. The aim of 21st Century Security is to integrate new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies to make forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable. 21st Century Security is an overarching vision that will guide our investment and strategy and we are also focused on four elements for potential growth in the near to mid-term: current programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics and new awards. We have multiple programs of record from each business segment that are entering growth stages, including the F-35 sustainment activity (Aeronautics), increased PAC-3 production rates (Missiles and Fire Control), CH-53K heavy lift helicopter (Rotary and Mission Systems), and the modernization and enhancements to the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (Space). We are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs, we expect to begin the transition from development to production over the next few years. We are currently performing on multiple hypersonic programs and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity, multiple programs are expected to enter early production phases between 2023 and 2026. Finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to place security capability into the market and expand our global reach.Key to enabling success of our strategy is developing differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. COVID-19COVID-19 continued to cause business impacts in 2022. The emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021 and resulting increase in COVID-19 cases in early 2022 adversely impacted our operations and our supply chain. Our performance was affected during 2022 by supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as labor challenges associated with employee absences, travel restrictions, site access, quarantine restrictions, remote work, and adjusted work schedules. The recovery from 30Table of Contents that disruption has been slower than originally anticipated, in particular within our supply chain, and some of those supply chain impacts are expected to continue into 2023. Attendance for employees required to be onsite fluctuated during 2022 based on COVID-19 developments. We are actively engaging with our customers and are continuing to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. In our on-going effort to mitigate supply chain risks, we accelerated payments of $1.5 billion to our suppliers as of December 31, 2022, that are due according to contractual terms in future periods, while consistently prioritizing small businesses, which make up over half of our active supply base, as well as at-risk businesses. Additionally, we have deployed resources at supplier sites to improve oversight and performance. We will continue to monitor supply chain risks, especially at small and at-risk related suppliers, and may continue to utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as needed basis.The impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the impact of potential new COVID-19 variants or subvariants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, and supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread,. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services also are difficult to predict, but could negatively affect our future results and performance.InflationHeightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions present risks for Lockheed Martin, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. During 2022, we have experienced impacts to our labor rates and suppliers have signaled inflation related cost pressures, which will flow through to our costs and pricing. Although inflation did not significantly impact our financial results in 2022, if inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs are likely to increase, resulting in pressure on our profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts. For new contract proposals, we are factoring into our pricing heightened levels of inflation based on accepted DoD escalation indices and other assumptions, and in some cases seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment (EPA) clauses, which would permit, subject to the particular contractual terms, cost adjustments in fixed-price contracts for unexpected inflation. In addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rates could constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services, in particular in the near term to the extent inflation assumptions are less than current inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates will also increase our borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. While rising interest rates reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations, they can also lead to decline in pension plan assets with offsetting impacts on our net pension liability. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.Conflict in UkraineRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns. As a result, we have received increased interest for some of our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture, particularly in Europe. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. government to Ukraine has created U.S. government demand to replenish U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders for our products. We are beginning to see this interest result in initiation of new contract discussions, however, given the long-cycle nature of our business and current industry capacity, we do not expect a significant increase in near term sales from new contracts in response to the conflict. We are evaluating capacity at our operations and the supply chain to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities. In addition, the U.S. Government and other nations have implemented broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting Russia, which combined with the conflict have the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resources. We have not, however, experienced significant adverse impacts to date and we will continue to monitor for any impacts and seek to mitigate disruption that may arise. The conflict also has increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other actors. We have taken steps designed to enhance our defensive posture against tactics and techniques associated with this increased threat. Portfolio Shaping ActivitiesWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of 31Table of Contents businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.Renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment ProgramOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK’s nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly, the AWE program’s ongoing operations, including the entity that manages the program, are no longer included in our financial results as of that date. Therefore, during 2021, AWE only generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, AWE generated sales of $1.4 billion and operating profit of $35 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for 2020.U.S. Government FundingOn March 28, 2022 the Administration submitted to Congress the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget request, which proposed $813.4 billion in total national defense spending, of which $773 billion was for the base budget of the Department of Defense (DoD).On December 29, 2022, the President signed the FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act into law, which provides $858 billion in total national defense funding, of which $816.7 billion is for the DoD base budget. This reflects a $44.6 billion increase over the FY 2023 request for national defense spending, and a $43.7 billion increase for the DoD.The FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act also provided separate and additional funding of $47 billion for Ukraine, the fourth supplemental since March of 2022, bringing the total amount of supplemental funding authority provided to $113 billion.The President’s FY 2024 budget request is anticipated to be submitted to Congress in March 2023, initiating the FY 2024 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. In addition to the FY 2024 budget process, Congress will have to contend with the legal limit on U.S. debt, commonly known as the debt ceiling. The current statutory limit of $31.4 trillion was reached in January, requiring the Treasury Department to take accounting measures to continue normally financing U.S. government obligations while avoiding exceeding the debt ceiling. It is expected, however, the U.S. government will exhaust these measures by June 2023. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. government may not be able to fulfill its funding obligations and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary programs and wider financial and economic repercussions. The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable congressional debate. Although we believe DoD, intelligence, and homeland security programs will continue to receive consensus support for increased funding and would likely receive priority if this scenario came to fruition, the effect on individual programs or Lockheed Martin cannot be predicted at this time.International BusinessA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2022, approximately 74% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 26% were DCS. Additionally, in 2022, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space’s sales from international customers were not material in 2022. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.In 2022, international customers accounted for 33% of Aeronautics’ net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and nine FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new aircraft.In 2022, international customers accounted for 31% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. 32Table of Contents Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Germany and Taiwan and for Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) from Australia.In 2022, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany and France. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters to international customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Greece. Additionally, in December 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to procure 12 CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopters, of which the first four were awarded in 2022. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation. Status of the F-35 ProgramThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and nine Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers; as well as interest from other countries. We saw strong international demand for the F-35 in 2022. During the first quarter of 2022, Finland became the seventh FMS customer to join the program. During the second quarter of 2022, the Government of Canada selected Lockheed Martin and the F-35 as the preferred bidder to move into the Finalization Phase of the competitive process to replace its fighter fleet. As a result of the Finalization Phase, the Government of Canada recently announced in January 2023 their commitment to purchase 88 F-35 aircraft. During the third quarter of 2022, the Swiss government signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the procurement of 36 F-35 aircraft and became the eighth FMS customer to join the program. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the German government signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the procurement of 35 F-35 aircraft and became the ninth FMS customer to join the program.During the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized the F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 15-17 production contract with the U.S. Government for up to 398 aircraft. The agreement includes 145 aircraft for Lot 15, 127 for Lot 16 and up to 126 for a Lot 17 contract option. In 2022 we delivered 141 aircraft and had a backlog of 345 production aircraft, including orders from our international partner countries and FMS customers. Since program inception we have delivered 894 production F-35 aircraft to U.S. and international customers, including 648 F-35A variants, 178 F-35B variants, and 68 F-35C variants, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity.COVID-19 and other impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have continued to impact our near-term production plans. At the end of 2022, there was an issue with the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) engine that resulted in a pause in flight operations and 2022 aircraft deliveries were impacted. The delivery pause continues as flight operations remain on hold and concurrently, GFE engine deliveries have been suspended. We will have greater clarity if changes to our 2023 aircraft delivery expectation are required once the pause in flight operations and the GFE engine delivery suspension have been resolved. As of January 2023, we plan on producing 147-153 aircraft in 2023 and 2024, and 2023 deliveries will be determined pending the resumption of engine deliveries and other factors. We anticipate annual deliveries of 156 aircraft in 2025 and for the foreseeable future.Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program, and delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries’ oversight, and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include our and our suppliers’ performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, inflation-related cost pressures, and the ability to improve affordability.BacklogAt December 31, 2022, our backlog was $150.0 billion compared with $135.4 billion at December 31, 2021. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 37% 33Table of Contents of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $95.5 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see below.Consolidated Results of Operations Our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):202220212020Net sales$65,984 $67,044 $65,398 Cost of sales(57,697)(57,983)(56,744)Gross profit8,287 9,061 8,654 Other income (expense), net61 62 (10)Operating profit8,348 9,123 8,644 Interest expense(623)(569)(591)Non-service FAS pension (expense) income(971)(1,292)219 Other non-operating (expense) income, net(74)288 (37)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes6,680 7,550 8,235 Income tax expense(948)(1,235)(1,347)Net earnings from continuing operations5,732 6,315 6,888 Net loss from discontinued operations— — (55)Net earnings$5,732 $6,315 $6,833 Diluted earnings (loss) per common shareContinuing operations$21.66 $22.76 $24.50 Discontinued operations— — (0.20)Total diluted earnings per common share$21.66 $22.76 $24.30 Certain amounts reported in other income (expense), net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations.34Table of Contents Net SalesWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):202220212020Products$55,466 $56,435 $54,928 % of total net sales84.1 %84.2 %84.0 %Services10,518 10,609 10,470 % of total net sales15.9 %15.8 %16.0 %Total net sales$65,984 $67,044 $65,398 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Overall, our sales were negatively affected in 2022 because of supply chain impacts.Product SalesProduct sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $670 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk and lower net sales for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $315 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE on June 30, 2021, partially offset by higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); and approximately $220 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and air dominance weapon systems. These decreases were partially offset by higher product sales of about $240 million at Aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on F-35 contracts.Service SalesService sales decreased $91 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in service sales was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $155 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program.Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):202220212020Cost of sales – products$(49,577)$(50,273)$(48,996)% of product sales89.4 %89.1 %89.2 %Cost of sales – services(9,280)(9,463)(9,371)% of service sales88.2 %89.2 %89.5 %Severance and other charges(100)(36)(27)Other unallocated, net1,260 1,789 1,650 Total cost of sales$(57,697)$(57,983)$(56,744)The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not 35Table of Contents identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.Product CostsProduct costs decreased approximately $696 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower product costs of approximately $525 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk and the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $195 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on air dominance weapon systems and THAAD; and approximately $165 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher development volume (NGI). These decreases were partially offset by higher product costs of about $185 million at Aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on F-35 contracts.Service CostsService costs decreased approximately $183 million, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower service costs of approximately $160 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on the SOF GLSS program.Severance and other chargesDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded charges totaling $100 million ($79 million, or $0.31 per share, after-tax) that relate to actions at our RMS business segment, which include severance costs for reduction of positions and asset impairment charges. After a strategic review of RMS, these actions will improve the efficiency of our operations, better align the organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions, and changes in program lifecycles. During 2021, we recorded severance and restructuring charges of $36 million ($28 million, or $0.10 per share, after-tax) associated with plans to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce the total workforce within our RMS business segment.Other Unallocated, NetOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations and the service cost component of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension expense), stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.3 billion in 2022, compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. Other unallocated, net during 2022 was lower primarily due to a decrease in our FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment due to lower CAS cost from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) legislation, declines in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. See “Business Segment Results of Operations” and “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our pension cost.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net primarily includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2022 was $61 million, compared to $62 million in 2021.Interest ExpenseInterest expense in 2022 was $623 million, compared to $569 million in 2021. The increase in interest expense in 2022 resulted primarily from the issuance of notes in October of 2022 to fund share repurchases. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) IncomeNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.0 billion in 2022, compared to $1.3 billion in 2021. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2022 includes a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of our 36Table of Contents gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the third quarter of 2021. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other Non-operating (Expense) Income, NetOther non-operating (expense) income, net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of mark-to-market investments. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating expense, net in 2022 was $74 million, compared to other non-operating income, net of $288 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of certain mark-to-market investments.Income Tax ExpenseOur effective income tax rate was 14.2% for 2022 and 16.4% for 2021. The rate for 2022 was lower than the rate for 2021 primarily due to increased research and development tax credits. The rates for both 2022 and 2021 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and employee equity awards.Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. This provision resulted in a cash tax liability for the 2022 tax year of approximately $660 million. Our net deferred tax assets increased in 2022 by approximately $660 million as a result as well. This provision is expected to increase our 2023 cash tax liability by approximately $575 million. The actual impact on 2023 cash tax liability will depend on the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2023 among other factors. While the largest impact of this provision will be to 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.As of December 31, 2021, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were not material. As of December 31, 2022, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions increased to $1.6 billion with a corresponding increase to net deferred tax assets primarily as a result of the provision described above from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. See “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom). The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.On August 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which contained provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we expect to be immaterial to our financial results, financial position and cash flows.Net EarningsWe reported net earnings of $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share) in 2022 and $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021. Both net earnings and earnings per share in 2022 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2022, compared to 2021. The reduction in weighted average common shares was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.37Table of Contents Business Segment Results of OperationsWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is our largest equity method investee.Business segment operating profit also excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, changes in the fair value of certain mark-to-market investments, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.38Table of Contents Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 202220212020Net salesAeronautics$26,987 $26,748 $26,266 Missiles and Fire Control11,317 11,693 11,257 Rotary and Mission Systems16,148 16,789 15,995 Space11,532 11,814 11,880 Total net sales$65,984 $67,044 $65,398 Operating profitAeronautics$2,866 $2,799 $2,843 Missiles and Fire Control1,635 1,648 1,545 Rotary and Mission Systems1,673 1,798 1,615 Space1,045 1,134 1,149 Total business segment operating profit7,219 7,379 7,152 Unallocated items FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment 1,709 1,960 1,876 Severance and other charges (a)(100)(36)(27)Other, net (b)(480)(180)(357)Total unallocated, net1,129 1,744 1,492 Total consolidated operating profit$8,348 $9,123 $8,644 (a)See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Severance and Other Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance and other actions across our organization.(b)Other, net in 2020 includes a noncash impairment charge of $128 million recognized on our investment in the international equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC). (See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan (expense) income calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension (expense) income components are included in non-service FAS pension (expense) income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment.39Table of Contents The total FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in millions):202220212020Total FAS (expense) income and CAS costFAS pension (expense) income$(1,058)$(1,398)$118 Less: CAS pension cost1,796 2,066 1,977 Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment$738 $668 $2,095 Service and non-service cost reconciliationFAS pension service cost$(87)$(106)$(101)Less: CAS pension cost1,796 2,066 1,977 Total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment1,709 1,960 1,876 Non-service FAS pension (expense) income(971)(1,292)219 Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment$738 $668 $2,095 The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2022 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.9 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the third quarter of 2021. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $150.0 billion and $135.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $95.5 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, 40Table of Contents schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. For further discussion on fixed-price contracts, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; COVID-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions; restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results); reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Our consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021. The consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments in 2022 compared to 2021 decreased primarily due to decreases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space, RMS and MFC offset by an increase in Aeronautics. The consolidated net adjustments for 2022 and 2021 are inclusive of approximately $780 million and $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at Aeronautics, various programs at RMS and a ground solutions program at Space.We periodically experience performance issues and record losses for certain programs. For further discussion on programs at Aeronautics and RMS, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.41Table of Contents We have contracted with the Canadian Government for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program at our RMS business segment that provide for design, development, and production of CH-148 aircraft (the Original Equipment contract), which is a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, and for logistical support to the fleet (the In Service Support contract) over an extended time period. The program has experienced performance issues, including delays in the final aircraft deliveries from the original contract requirement, and to date the Royal Canadian Air Force’s flight hours have been less than originally anticipated, which has impacted program revenues and the recovery of our costs under this program. Future sales and recovery of existing and future costs under the program are highly dependent upon achieving a certain number of flight hours, which could be adversely impacted by aircraft availability and performance, and the availability of Canadian government resources. We are currently in discussions with the Canadian Government to potentially restructure certain contractual terms and conditions that may be beneficial to both parties. Future performance issues or changes in our estimates due to revised contract scope or customer requirements may affect our ability to recover our costs and may result in a loss that could be material to our operating results.We also have a number of contracts with Türkish industry for the Türkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which anticipates co-production with Türkish industry for production of T70 helicopters for use in Türkiye, as well as the related provision of Türkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future sales of helicopters built in Türkiye for sale globally. The U.S. Government has imposed certain sanctions on Türkish entities and persons that has affected our ability to perform under contracts supporting the Türkish Utility Helicopter Program. As a result of the sanctions, we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts and these contracts may be restructured or terminated, either in whole or in part, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 202220212020Net sales$26,987 $26,748 $26,266 Operating profit2,866 2,799 2,843 Operating margin10.6 %10.5 %10.8 %Backlog at year-end$56,630 $49,118 $56,551 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2022 increased $239 million, or 1%, compared to 2021. Net sales increased by approximately $375 million on classified contracts primarily due to higher volume; about $80 million for the F-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments; and approximately $55 million for the F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower volume on sustainment contracts and unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and modernization contracts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $310 million for the F-35 program due to lower volume and favorable profit adjustments on sustainment and production contracts that were partially offset by higher volume on development contracts.Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2022 increased $67 million, or 2%, compared to 2021. Operating profit increased approximately $145 million on classified contracts primarily due to lower unfavorable profit adjustments on a classified program ($45 million in 2022 compared to $225 million in 2021) that were partially offset by lower favorable profit adjustments; and about $100 million for the F-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments. These increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $110 million for the F-16 program due to unfavorable profit adjustments in 2022 on a production contract and modernization contracts; and about $80 million for the F-35 program due to lower net favorable profit adjustments on production and sustainment contracts and volume on sustainment contracts. Net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $30 million higher in 2022 compared to 2021.BacklogBacklog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the delay of F-35 Lot 15 award from 2021 to 2022 and the award of the F-35 Lot 16 contract in December 2022.42Table of Contents Missiles and Fire ControlOur MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER®), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21®) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS). MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):202220212020Net sales$11,317 $11,693 $11,257 Operating profit1,635 1,648 1,545 Operating margin14.4 %14.1 %13.7 %Backlog at year-end$28,735 $27,021 $29,183 MFC’s net sales in 2022 decreased $376 million, or 3%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $280 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume on SOF GLSS as a result of changes in mission requirements and lower volume on SNIPER®; and about $60 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to lower volume (THAAD) and lower net favorable profit adjustments (PAC-3) that were partially offset by higher volume (PAC-3). Net sales for tactical and strike missile programs were comparable as higher volume (PrSM) was offset by lower volume (air dominance weapon systems).MFC’s operating profit in 2022 decreased $13 million, or 1%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $85 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments for the PAC-3 program and an unfavorable profit adjustment of about $40 million on an air and missile defense development program. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of about $50 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to contract mix and higher net favorable profit adjustments (an international tactical and strike missile program and HIMARS) that were partially offset by an unfavorable profit adjustment of about $25 million on an air-to-ground missile program. There also were unfavorable profit adjustments of approximately $25 million on an energy program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. Operating profit for sensors and global sustainment programs was comparable as both contract mix and the net effect of favorable profit adjustments on an international program in 2022 were offset by the closeout activities related to the Warrior program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. Net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $45 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021.BacklogBacklog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher orders on precision fires (GMLRS) and THAAD programs.Rotary and Mission Systems RMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions. RMS’ major programs include Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), VH-92A helicopter, and the C2BMC program. On December 5, 2022, the U.S. Army selected Sikorsky’s competitor in the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft Competition, a component of its Future Vertical Lift initiative to replace a portion of its assault and utility helicopter fleet. On December 28, 2022, Sikorsky, on behalf of Team DEFIANT, filed a protest challenging the U.S. Army’s decision, and a ruling is expected on or before April 7, 2023 based on the 100-day deadline. Sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative, the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft competition.43Table of Contents RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions):202220212020Net sales$16,148 $16,789 $15,995 Operating profit1,673 1,798 1,615 Operating margin10.4 %10.7 %10.1 %Backlog at year-end$34,949 $33,700 $36,249 RMS’ net sales in 2022 decreased $641 million, or 4%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $280 million for TLS programs primarily due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022; about $205 million for various C6ISR programs due to lower volume; and approximately $170 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume (Black Hawk) that was partially offset by higher production volume (CH-53K).RMS’ operating profit in 2022 decreased $125 million, or 7%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $70 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume and net favorable profit adjustments (Black Hawk) that were partially offset by higher net favorable profit adjustments (CRH); about $50 million for various C6ISR programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments; and approximately $15 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (TPQ-53 and Aegis) that were partially offset by $30 million of unfavorable profit adjustments on a ground-based radar program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $35 million for TLS programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments that were partially offset by lower volume due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022. Net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $65 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021.BacklogBacklog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher orders on Sikorsky programs.Space Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, hypersonics programs and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions):202220212020Net sales$11,532 $11,814 $11,880 Operating profit1,045 1,134 1,149 Operating margin9.1 %9.6 %9.7 %Backlog at year-end$29,684 $25,516 $25,148 Space’s net sales in 2022 decreased $282 million, or 2%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $885 million due to the renationalization of the AWE program on June 30, 2021, which was no longer included in our financial results beginning in the third quarter of 2021; and about $125 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower volume (Orion). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $495 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher development volume (NGI); and about $245 million for national security space programs due to higher development volume (classified programs).Space’s operating profit in 2022 decreased $89 million, or 8%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for national security space programs primarily due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (classified programs and SBIRS) that were partially offset by lower net unfavorable profit adjustments of $25 million on a 44Table of Contents ground solutions program; and about $40 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (Human Lander System (HLS)) and lower volume (Orion). These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings of approximately $35 million from the company's investment in ULA due to higher launch volume and launch mix; and about $20 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (primarily NGI). Operating profit for the AWE program was comparable as its operating profit in 2021 was mostly offset by accelerated amortization expense for intangible assets as a result of the renationalization. Net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $150 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021.Equity earningsTotal equity earnings (primarily ULA) represented approximately $100 million and $65 million, or 10% and 6%, of Space’s operating profit during 2022 and 2021. BacklogBacklog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the exercise of the Orion Production Contract option for Artemis VI-VIII in commercial civil space and contract awards in national security space (Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPan) and classified).Liquidity and Cash FlowsAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. This access includes our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash from operations. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, from time to time, we fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a contract award, this negatively affects our cash flows and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2022, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.To date, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier disruptions and delays. The U.S. Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on public health, the economy, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses. Since the pandemic began, Lockheed Martin has remained committed to accelerating payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at risk businesses. As of December 31, 2022, we have accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor supply chain risks, especially at small and at-risk related suppliers, and may continue to utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as needed basis. In addition, we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business 45Table of Contents opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. On October 17, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $14.0 billion to the program. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock and issued $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $10.0 billion, which is expected to be utilized over a three-year period. We expect to fund the repurchases through a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of additional debt. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The amount of shares ultimately purchased and the timing of purchases are at the discretion of management and subject to compliance with applicable law and regulation.We continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, as evidenced by the debt transaction in the second quarter of 2022, the proceeds of which were used to refinance certain upcoming debt maturities between 2023 and 2026. We also actively manage our pension obligations and expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust as we did in the second quarter of 2022. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future pension risk transfer transactions could also be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust.The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 202220212020Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year$3,604 $3,160 $1,514 Operating activitiesNet earnings5,732 6,315 6,833 Noncash adjustments2,455 3,109 1,726 Changes in working capital(733)9 101 Other, net348 (212)(477)Net cash provided by operating activities7,802 9,221 8,183 Net cash used for investing activities(1,789)(1,161)(2,010)Net cash used for financing activities(7,070)(7,616)(4,527)Net change in cash and cash equivalents(1,057)444 1,646 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$2,547 $3,604 $3,160 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash at Aeronautics, MFC and RMS. The decrease at Aeronautics was primarily due to timing of production and billing cycles impacting contract assets (primarily F-35). The decrease at MFC was primarily due to timing of accounts receivables collections. The decrease at RMS was primarily due to liquidation of inventories (primarily TLS and Sikorsky helicopter programs) in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to suppliers that were due in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that were due in the first quarter of 2022. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.6 billion in 2022, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021.Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). We use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity, as well as a performance goal in our annual and long-term incentive plans. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions and other investments. The entire amount of free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the 46Table of Contents repayment of maturing debt and pension contributions. While management believes that free cash flow as a non-GAAP financial measure may be useful in evaluating our financial performance, it should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):202220212020Cash from operations$7,802 $9,221 $8,183 Capital expenditures(1,670)(1,522)(1,766)Free cash flow$6,132 $7,699 $6,417 Investing ActivitiesCash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments. The majority of our capital expenditures are for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.Net cash used for investing activities increased $628 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to an increase in capital expenditures and the receipt of $307 million in 2021 from the sale of our ownership interest in the Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC) joint venture. Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion in 2022 and 2021.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities decreased $546 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to repayment of $500 million of long-term notes in 2021. We paid dividends totaling $3.0 billion ($11.40 per share) in 2022 and $2.9 billion ($10.60 per share) in 2021. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.80 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2022 and $3.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2022. We paid quarterly dividends of $2.60 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2021 and $2.80 per share during the fourth quarter of 2021.During 2022, we paid $7.9 billion to repurchase 18.3 million shares of our common stock. See “Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2021, we paid $4.1 billion to repurchase 11.7 million shares of our common stock.In October 2022, we received net proceeds of $3.9 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds from the offering to enter into an ASR agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock. See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In May 2022, we received net proceeds of $2.3 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million Notes due 2023, $750 million Notes due 2025 and used the remaining balance of the net proceeds to redeem $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion Notes due 2026.In September 2021, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.35% according to their scheduled maturities.Capital Structure, Resources and OtherAt December 31, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that were generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, was $15.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities.47Table of Contents We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.Long-Term DebtOn October 24, 2022, we issued a total of $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.95% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.10% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.70% Notes due 2054 (the “2054 Notes”) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Notes due 2063 (the “2063 Notes” and, together with the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2033 Notes and the 2054 Notes, the “October 2022 Notes”). We will pay interest on the 2025 Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2023. We will pay interest on the 2033 Notes semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2023. We will pay interest on each of 2027 Notes, 2054 Notes and 2063 Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2023. We may, at our option, redeem the October 2022 Notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or an applicable “make-whole” amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On May 5, 2022, we issued a total of $2.3 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% Notes due June 15, 2032 (the “2032 Notes”), $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Notes due June 15, 2053 (the “2053 Notes”) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30% Notes due June 15, 2062 (the “2062 Notes” and, together with the 2032 Notes and 2053 Notes, the “May 2022 Notes”) in a registered public offering. Net proceeds received from the offering were, after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the May 2022 Notes. We will pay interest on the May 2022 Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year with the first payment made on June 15, 2022. We may, at our option, redeem the May 2022 Notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the May 2022 Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.On May 11, 2022, we used the net proceeds from the May 2022 Notes to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.10% Notes due 2023, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.90% Notes due 2025, and $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 3.55% Notes due 2026 at their redemption price. We paid make-whole premiums of $13.9 million in connection with the early extinguishments of debt. We incurred losses of $34 million ($26 million, or $0.10 per share, after tax) on these transactions related to early extinguishments of debt, additional interest expense and other related charges, which was recorded in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of earnings.48Table of Contents Contractual Commitments At December 31, 2022, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):TotalDue Within 1 YearTotal debt$16,842 $118 Interest payments15,028 768 Other liabilities 3,520 222 Operating lease obligations1,342 327 Purchase obligations:Operating activities59,101 27,925 Capital expenditures671 472 Total contractual cash obligations$96,504 $29,832 The table above includes debt presented gross of any unamortized discounts and issuance costs, but excludes the net unfunded obligation and estimated minimum funding requirements related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2022. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $53.7 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2022 and those planned for 2023 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2023 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2022 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway at Aeronautics to support classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of 49Table of Contents ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2022, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $16.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2022 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the contractual commitments table above. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2022, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Total CommitmentLess Than1 Year Standby letters of credit (a)$2,504 $966 Surety bonds342 342 Third-party Guarantees904 230 Total commitments$3,750 $1,538 (a)Approximately $704 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.At December 31, 2022, third-party guarantees totaled $904 million, of which approximately 71% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract Accounting / Sales RecognitionThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., 50Table of Contents incentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary (e.g. awards, incentive fees and claims), we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.51Table of Contents For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; COVID-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions; restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results); reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.Other Contract Accounting ConsiderationsThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.52Table of Contents We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.Postretirement Benefit PlansOverviewMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.Similar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. During the second quarter of 2022, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,600 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans in the quarter ended June 26, 2022, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders’ equity. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) during the third quarter of 2021. Inclusive of the transactions described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $15.9 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 109,000 retirees and beneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $79 million per year.We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.Actuarial AssumptionsThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and participant longevity. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of FAS expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 5.250% at December 31, 2022, compared to 2.875% at December 31, 53Table of Contents 2021. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 5.25% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2022, compared to 2.75% at December 31, 2021. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $10.2 billion at December 31, 2022.We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2022 of $(5.9) billion, based on an actual rate of approximately (18)%, reduced plan assets more than the $1.9 billion expected return based on our long-term rate of return assumption.Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $7.9 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates, investment experience, and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, $1.2 billion of these amounts, along with amortization of net prior service credit, were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.2 billion. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.25% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2022, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2022 by approximately $800 million, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $600 million. If the 5.25% discount rate at December 31, 2022 that was used to compute the expected 2023 FAS pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension income projected for 2023 would change approximately $5 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2022 that was used to compute the expected 2023 FAS pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension income projected for 2023 would be higher or lower by approximately $65 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS pension income. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2022 between our actual rate of return of approximately (18)% and our expected long-term rate of return increased (decreased) 2023 expected FAS pension income by approximately $10 million.Funding ConsiderationsWe made no contributions in 2022 and 2021 to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with ERISA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 82% and 92% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021; which is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP and reflects the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to 54Table of Contents which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.We recovered $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.1 billion in 2021 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $4.3 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.Environmental MattersWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $696 million and $742 million. We have recorded assets totaling $618 million and $645 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts is expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $89 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to 55Table of Contents remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which typically ranges from five to 20 years.Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.In the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed, including Sikorsky. Based on this, the fair value 56Table of Contents of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 40%. The fair value of both our Sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset can be significantly impacted by its performance, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at our Sikorsky reporting unit are at risk for impairment should there be a significant deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit. We do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19 or inflation.Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.57Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and the outstanding principal amount was $16.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2022.We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.3 billion and $500 million. The increase in 2022 was designated on the additional debt we issued during the fourth quarter. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7.3 billion and $4.0 billion. The increase in 2022 is due to the timing of foreign denominated international contract awards. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2022, investments in the trust totaled $1.6 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2022.58Table of Contents We are exposed to equity market risk through certain marketable securities. The fair value of these marketable securities was $24 million as of December 31, 2022. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2022 would not have a material impact on the carrying amounts of these securities or our consolidated financial statements. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the valuations and prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:28.502446

Markets for defense and advanced technology systems during 2004 and beyond will continue to be affected by the worldwide war against terrorism, and the continued need for military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and related reconstruction efforts. These realities have increased the need for greater attention to the security of our homeland and for better communication and interplay between law enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military services. Our nation’s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more capabilities-based structure, which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility, stronger space capabilities, enhanced missile defense and improved information systems capabilities and security. We anticipate that the next Congressionally mandated “Quadrennial Defense Review” (QDR) undertaken by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) will reinforce and advance efforts at the DoD to refocus activities towards joint operations, net-centric command and control, and integrated capabilities for the armed forces. Recognizing this emerging priority at the DoD, we formed Integrated Systems & Solutions, a new business segment, in 2003 from existing components of our Electronic Systems and Space Systems segments. We believe this new segment will help us better focus our integrated solutions capabilities across the Corporation and enhance our ability to serve as a lead partner with the DoD to respond to this customer priority. The President’s budget for the DoD for fiscal year 2004 and beyond responds to increased needs for homeland security and combating terrorism. This is evidenced by budget increases for operational readiness and personnel needs, as well as for both procurement and research and development. This trend was reiterated in the Future Year Defense Plan (FYDP) submitted with the President’s budget for fiscal year 2005. It projects sustained growth in both the procurement and research and development budgets for the DoD through fiscal year 2006 and, in the case of the procurement budgetary authority, through fiscal year 2009. While there is no assurance that the increased DoD budget levels will be approved by Congress, the current defense budget outlook appears to be one of modest growth. However, the level of growth and the amount of the budget that will ultimately be allocated to the investment accounts most closely aligned with our business (i.e., procurement, research and development) is unknown. During 2003, Congress appropriated additional amounts to pay for operational costs for military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as for reconstruction activities. These supplemental appropriations enabled the DoD to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs, versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. The DoD expects a further supplemental appropriation to continue these missions as needed through 2005. As a result, we do not anticipate that sustained operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will materially impact the procurement and research and development budget levels projected in the 2005 to 2009 FYDP. Our broad mix of programs and capabilities gives us the ability to support the needs of the various agencies of the U.S. Government that require our products and services. Our major programs and capabilities include: missile defense; space intelligence; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); air mobility 44 aircraft; and air-power projection / precision-strike capability. In terms of size and long-term potential impact, two of our more significant programs are the F/A-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. We are also represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the Multiple Kill Vehicle program, and the High Altitude Airship program. In the areas of space intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as Transformational Communications, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H), and in classified programs and battle management command and control capabilities. In airlift, we have the C-130J program and are under contract to upgrade the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. Many of these programs are large and require funding over several budget cycles. There are risks associated with these and other large, highly visible programs subject to appropriation by Congress that, because of their size, could be expected to become potential targets for reduction or extension of funding to pay for other programs. The Office of Management and Budget recently announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive review of the F/A-22 Raptor program. This independent assessment will evaluate the performance, requirements and cost aspects of the program. We believe sustained improved performance in production and testing of the F/A-22 will re-validate the transformational qualities of this weapons system, and the suitability of the F/A-22 for continued production by the U.S. Air Force. We continue to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and E-Government solutions. Consistent with the President’s agenda, the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by recent rule changes for public/private competitions. In addition, recent trends have indicated an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. In addition, the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports and waterways security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, information systems security and other technical systems solutions. In prior years, companies in our industry had reacted to historically shrinking defense budgets for procurement and research and development by combining to maintain critical mass. More recently, we have focused our efforts on select core acquisitions, cost savings and improving efficiency, as well as generating cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation. Through our consolidation activities, we have been able to pass along savings to our customers, mainly the DoD. Non-U.S. defense budgets have generally been declining over the past decade. As a result, consolidation has also been occurring in the European aerospace industry, resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors, potentially resulting in an environment where there could be less demand abroad for products from U.S. companies. This type of environment could reduce opportunities for European partnerships and sales potential for U.S. exports. 45 Space Business The commercial launch vehicle marketplace remains very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. The reduction in demand has resulted in pricing pressures in both the launch vehicle and satellite markets. We received new orders for both commercial satellites and launch vehicles in 2003; however, the majority of those orders relate to replacement satellites versus an expansion of telecommunications capacity. The above factors have impacted orders for all of our commercial launch vehicles, including the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV or Atlas V), our next generation launch vehicle program in which we have made significant investments over the past few years. The Atlas V is available for both commercial and government use. This program has required investment of funds for research and development, start-up and other nonrecurring costs, and launch facilities. Some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the U.S. Government. Commercial orders to-date for the Atlas V launch vehicle have been lower than originally expected and at lower prices. However, we have received a total of 18 EELV launch assignments from the U.S. Government (including those described in the following paragraph), 3 of which are under contract. We had our third Atlas V launch in 2003. In July 2003, the U.S. Air Force announced that our competitor in the EELV competition had violated the Procurement Integrity Act. As a result of that determination, the Air Force reassigned 7 launch vehicles from the initial competition (referred to as “Buy 1”) to us and removed our exclusion from west coast launches. At the same time, the Air Force assigned us 3 new west coast launches. To prepare for providing the west coast launches, we are upgrading west coast launch facilities, which will require further investment in the EELV program. However, we expect to recover that investment through pricing of the west coast launches. The 7 reassigned launches are expected to occur over the 2005 through 2009 time period. Contractual terms and conditions related to the west coast launches have not yet been finalized with the Air Force. Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International, Inc. (LKEI), a joint venture we have with two Russian government-owned space firms, has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets from a launch site in Kazakhstan. Commercial Atlas and Proton launch services are marketed around the world through International Launch Services (ILS), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and LKEI. We consolidate the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on controlling financial interest. We received 7 new awards for launches on Proton vehicles in 2003. Contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer prior to launch. At the end of 2003, $250 million of advances received from customers for Proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability on our balance sheet in the caption “Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred.” A sizeable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for Proton launch services are sent to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev), the manufacturer of the launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in Russia. If a contracted launch service is not provided, a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer. In addition, we have sent advances to Khrunichev for 46 launches we purchased which have not yet been assigned to customers. The advances sent to Khrunichev are included on our balance sheet in inventories. Advances for launches not under contract are subject to an agreement entered into in 2002 which provides for reduced future launch payments from us to Khrunichev, contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a minimum number of actual launches each year. As a result of this agreement, as well as our assessment in 2002 of the likelihood of customer terminations for convenience for launches under contract, we reduced the carrying value of our advances to Khrunichev and recognized a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $173 million. The charge reduced 2002 net earnings by $112 million ($0.25 per diluted share). At year-end 2003, payments to Khrunichev included in inventories, net of the amount of the reserve recorded in 2002, totaled $327 million. Our ability to realize the remaining amounts may be affected by Khrunichev’s ability to provide the launch services and the political environment in Russia. Through the end of 2003, launch services through LKEI and ILS have been provided according to contract terms. The Corporation has entered into an agreement with RD AMROSS, a joint venture of the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation and the Russian firm NPO Energomash, for the purchase, subject to certain conditions, of RD-180 booster engines for use in the Corporation’s Atlas launch vehicles. Terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to RD AMROSS upon the achievement of certain milestones in the manufacturing process. Payments of $57 million made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the Corporation’s inventories at December 31, 2003. As discussed above, the commercial satellite market has continued to experience pricing pressures due to excess capacity and lower demand. Satellite demand also has been impacted by the business difficulties encountered by some companies in the commercial satellite services industry which have resulted in reduced access to capital and a reduction in the total market size in the near term. However, in the past year, we received 5 new commercial satellite orders, generally for replacement satellites versus capacity expansion. We expect to continue to control costs in our commercial satellite manufacturing business while keeping our focus on providing a reliable product. We also received new orders for government satellites in 2003 related to classified activities. Other Business Considerations As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The Government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under Government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 47 Changes in government procurement policies and practices over the past several years, such as increases in the progress payment rate and the use of performance-based payments, have had a positive effect on our financial position and cash flows. But we are still exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties and obsolescence, and having to depend on Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. In addition to our defense businesses, we also provide products and services to most civil government customers, as well as to commercial customers. We provide products and services to government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Postal Service, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration. Although our lines of business in civil government and commercial markets are not dependent on defense budgets, they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, as well as other risks unique to their particular marketplaces. Although indemnification by the U.S. Government may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed for homeland security purposes. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We do plan to seek limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the “SAFETY Act” provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In the event we were to provide homeland security-related products and services to a customer without such qualification, we would not be afforded the benefit of the SAFETY Act’s cap on tort liability or U.S. Government indemnification. Other risks unique to the civil government and commercial markets may include development of competing products, technological feasibility and product obsolescence. We provide products and services to NASA, including the Space Shuttle program, mainly through our Space Systems and Information & Technology Services business segments. Work for NASA accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales in 2003. We also have a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. We worked with NASA and others in the independent investigation of the tragic accident in February 2003 involving the Space Shuttle Columbia. The investigation is now completed. We do not expect that the effects of this accident will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We expect to compete for NASA programs related to the new Space Exploration Initiative announced by the President, which includes development of human-rated space launch and transportation systems over the next 15 years, replacing the current space shuttle architecture. We have entered into various joint venture, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business, including commercial space. Some of these business arrangements include foreign partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic 48 conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition A large part of our business is derived from long-term contracts for development, production and service activities which we account for consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) audit and accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government Contractors,” the AICPA’s Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,” and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract. Generally, we record long-term fixed-price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenue. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program, Atlas and Proton launch vehicle programs and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term fixed-price contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, revenues are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure percentage of completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F/A-22 Raptor program and the AEGIS Weapons System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low level of initial production units in their initial phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method after considering, among other factors, production stabilization. We record sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts as we incur the costs. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter system development and demonstration (SDD) program and the THAAD missile defense program. The majority of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). 49 As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements in accounting for long-term contracts. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Incentives and award fees related to performance on contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Award fees are estimated based on actual and anticipated awards. The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government, and therefore not necessarily on market-based factors. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, public relations, and stock-based compensation programs are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under agreements reached with the U.S. Government. Products and services provided under long-term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business, and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel assess the status 50 of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with income or expense for qualified defined benefit plans (pension plans) because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (FAS 87). Those rules require that the amounts we record, including the income or expense for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the following fiscal year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and, in the case of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, past investment experience, judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. An example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in 2003. As required by FAS 87, we reassessed the discount rate assumption at the end of 2003. Based on our review of interest rates at the end of the year, we lowered our discount rate assumption to 6.25% at year-end 2003, versus 6.75% used for 2002 and 7.25% used for 2001. This change, together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years, resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for 2004 will approximately double as compared to $484 million of expense recorded in 2003. Also, at the end of 2002, we recorded a noncash after-tax adjustment of $1.5 billion in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for most of our pension plans. The adjustment did not impact earnings, but reduced our stockholders’ equity. This adjustment is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and is determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for each plan to the fair value of that plan’s assets. The amount by which the ABO exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan, must be recorded as a minimum pension liability, with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset, if appropriate, and a reduction to stockholders’ equity, consistent with FAS 87. In 2003, we reduced the 51 adjustment recorded in stockholders’ equity in 2002 by about $300 million, mainly due to favorable asset returns for the year. Again, this minimum pension liability adjustment did not impact 2003 earnings. The amount of the minimum pension liability is computed at each year-end and could potentially continue to reduce the amount recorded in 2002 in future periods if financial markets improve and interest rates increase, or could potentially increase if financial market performance and interest rates decline. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) is a major factor in determining our funding requirements and governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore are recognized in our net sales. The total funding requirement for our pension plans under CAS in 2003 was $184 million. For 2004, we expect our funding requirements under CAS to increase. Also in 2004, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code rules. Any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and therefore will be recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods. In December 2003, we made a discretionary prepayment of $450 million to the pension trust, the majority of which will reduce our cash funding requirements for 2004. There is currently proposed legislation that would change the measurement of the liabilities that are included in the funding calculations for 2004. Our funding projections assume that this proposed legislation will be passed and become effective for 2004. We would expect our projected funding requirements for 2004 to increase if the proposed legislation does not become law. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Since the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. See the discussion of “Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net” under “Discussion of Business Segments.” The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law by the President in December 2003. Historically, Medicare has not provided prescription drug benefits. Under the new law, Medicare will provide a prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. The Act also provides for a federal subsidy to eligible sponsors of retiree health care benefits. At this point, there is a lack of clarity regarding how some of the key provisions of the Act will be applied and administered, and how it will impact the prescription drug benefits that we provide our retirees. In addition, specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is still pending and that guidance, when issued, could require a change to previously reported information. In recognition of these uncertainties, the Financial Accounting Standards Board decided to allow companies to defer recognition of the impact of the new law on the benefit obligations they provide their retirees, which we have elected to do. Accordingly, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for our retiree health care benefits, as well as the net periodic postretirement benefit cost, included in our financial statements and the accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act. It is expected that 52 any such change would result in some reduction to the APBO and the net periodic postretirement benefits cost. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental clean-up issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the Environmental Protection Agency or by a state agency. We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to, along with other factors, difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, and agreements between PRPs to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental clean-up activities usually cover several years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean-up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise, we project costs over a reasonable time frame not to exceed 20 years. Given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean-up and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, however, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental 53 expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the end of 2003 and 2002, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was approximately $425 million and $445 million, respectively. About two-thirds of the liability recorded at the end of 2003 related to sites in Redlands, Burbank and Glendale, California, and in Great Neck, New York, mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The remainder of the liability related to other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) for which the financial exposure can be estimated. We have recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for U.S. Government businesses. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales. Any recoveries we receive would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government sales and cost of sales. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities In November 2003, we completed transactions resulting in our acquisition of the majority of the federal government information technology (IT) business of Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (ACS), and ACS’ concurrent acquisition of our commercial IT business. The total purchase price related to our acquisition of ACS’ federal government IT business, including transaction-related costs, was approximately $585 million. As part of our accounting for the acquisition of the federal IT business, we recorded intangible assets totaling about $112 million related to contracts acquired and a covenant not to compete which will be amortized over 5 to 7 year periods, and goodwill of about $460 million. This acquisition expands our capabilities in business process outsourcing and managed services, thereby enhancing our ability to support civil and defense government agencies. The divestiture of our commercial IT business to ACS resulted in a cash payment to us from ACS of approximately $110 million and a gain, net of state income taxes, of $15 million. The gain increased net earnings by approximately $8 million ($0.02 per diluted share). The operations of the business acquired are included in the Information & Technology Services (I&TS) business segment. The majority of the operations divested had been included in the I&TS segment, with the remainder from the Information Systems & Solutions business segment. In September 2003, we announced that Lockheed Martin and The Titan Corporation had entered into a merger agreement for Lockheed Martin to acquire Titan. The announced value of the transaction, including the assumption of Titan’s long-term debt, is approximately $2.4 billion before accumulated tax benefits. Under the merger agreement, stockholders of Titan may elect to receive $22 per share in cash, an equivalent amount of Lockheed Martin common stock based on an exchange rate or a combination of cash and stock, subject to the allocation procedures set forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that 50% of Titan’s outstanding common stock must be exchanged for Lockheed Martin common stock, and 50% of the Titan common stock must be exchanged for cash. The exchange rate will be determined by dividing $22 by the average trading price of Lockheed Martin common stock over a 10 day trading period, subject to upper and lower limits, or “collars,” of $58 and $46 per share. Under certain circumstances, the exchange rate for the stock portion of the merger consideration will be fixed based on the upper collar of $58 per share or the lower collar of $46 per share. Upon consummation of the merger, we would expect to issue between 16 and 22 million shares of our common stock, depending on the exchange rate. We plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction principally using existing cash and short-term investment holdings. 54 On February 13, 2004, Lockheed Martin and Titan announced that representatives of both companies had initiated meetings with the Department of Justice and the SEC to advise of an internal review relating to certain agreements between Titan and international consultants and related payments in foreign countries. The SEC informed Lockheed Martin and Titan that it has commenced an investigation into whether payments by Titan were made in violation of applicable law. Lockheed Martin is independently reviewing Titan’s payments to international consultants to assess whether all conditions to the closing of the proposed merger will be satisfied. Lockheed Martin has requested that Titan afford it access to all relevant information related to its relationships with international consultants so that the review may be completed in advance of the Titan stockholders’ meeting. Titan is cooperating with this request, as well as conducting its own review. During the course of our review, we learned of allegations that improper payments were made, or items of value were provided, by consultants for Titan or its subsidiaries directly or indirectly to foreign officials. The alleged payments and provision of items of value, if true, raise questions concerning whether there has been a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We also are reviewing with Titan whether payments made by Titan to consultants were accurately reflected on Titan’s books and records. Our review is ongoing. Together with Titan, we disclosed the allegations to the SEC and the Department of Justice. During that meeting, Lockheed Martin and Titan were informed that the Department of Justice has initiated a criminal inquiry into this matter. Closing of the Titan transaction is subject to approval of Titan’s stockholders, the absence of any material adverse change in Titan and other conditions set forth in the merger agreement. Either Lockheed Martin or Titan may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by March 31, 2004, provided that the party seeking to terminate the agreement is not then in material breach of its obligations under the merger agreement in a manner that has contributed to the failure to consummate the merger. The full text of the merger agreement is publicly available as an attachment to the proxy statement/prospectus mailed to Titan stockholders and as an exhibit to Lockheed Martin’s 2003 Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we plan to continue to explore the sale of various non-core businesses, passive equity investments and surplus real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such holdings or real estate, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses, if any, would be recorded when they are probable and estimable. We also continue to review our businesses on an ongoing basis to identify ways to improve organizational effectiveness and performance, and to focus on our core business strategy. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Continuing Operations The following discussion of net sales and operating results will provide an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our “Consolidated Statement of Operations.” The “Discussion of Business Segments” which follows, will review the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated results for 2003, 2002 and 2001. For 2003, net sales were $31.8 billion, a 20% increase over 2002 sales. Sales for 2002 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 11% compared to 2001. Sales increased in all segments as compared to the prior year for the second straight year. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 78% of our sales for 2003, compared to 80% in 2002 and 78% in 2001. 55 For 2003, 2002 and 2001 the items in the table below, among other things, were included in “Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net” (see the related “Discussion of Business Segments” below). (In millions, except per share data) Operating (Loss) Profit Net (Loss) Earnings (Loss) Earnings perDiluted Share Year ended December 31, 2003 Loss on early retirement of debt $ (146 ) $ (96 ) $ (0.21 ) Charge related to exit from the commercial mail sorting business (41 ) (27 ) (0.06 ) Gain on partial reversal of Space Imaging guarantee 19 13 0.03 Gain on sale of the commercial IT business 15 8 0.02 $ (153 ) $ (102 ) $ (0.22 ) Year ended December 31, 2002 Write-down of telecommunications investments $ (776 ) $ (504 ) $ (1.12 ) Charge related to a Russian launch services provider (173 ) (112 ) (0.25 ) Write-down of investment in Space Imaging and charge related to recording of guarantee (163 ) (106 ) (0.23 ) Benefit from R&D tax credit settlement — 90 0.20 $ (1,112 ) $ (632 ) $ (1.40 ) Year ended December 31, 2001 Write-off of investment in Astrolink and related costs $ (387 ) $ (267 ) $ (0.62 ) Write-down of investment in Loral Space (361 ) (235 ) (0.54 ) Other charges related to global telecommunications (176 ) (117 ) (0.27 ) Impairment charge related to Americom Asia-Pacific (100 ) (65 ) (0.15 ) Loss on early repayment of debt (55 ) (36 ) (0.08 ) Gain on sale of surplus real estate 111 72 0.17 Other activities, net (5 ) (3 ) (0.01 ) $ (973 ) $ (651 ) $ (1.50 ) Our operating profit for 2003 was $2.0 billion, an increase of 74% compared to 2002. Our operating profit for 2002 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 39% compared to 2001. The results for 2001 included amortization expense of $274 million for goodwill and certain other intangibles that was not included in 2002 or 2003 due to the adoption of FAS 142. See Note 1 to the financial statements for information regarding our adoption of FAS 142. Interest expense for 2003 was $487 million, $94 million lower than the amount for 2002. This was primarily the result of reductions in our debt portfolio and the favorable impact of having issued $1.0 billion of convertible notes in August 2003 to replace higher cost debt. Interest expense for 2002 was $581 million, $119 million lower than in 2001 mainly due to reductions in our debt portfolio and the benefit from interest rate swap agreements. 56 Our effective tax rates were 31.3% for 2003, 7.7% for 2002 and 67.7% for 2001. The tax rate for 2002 was reduced by a $90 million tax benefit related to a research and development tax credit settlement, and the rate for 2001 was increased by non-deductible goodwill that was being amortized for financial reporting purposes. The effective tax rates for all periods were reduced by tax benefits related to export sales, changes to prior year liabilities arising from tax refund initiatives and adjustments to true-up actual tax return liabilities. The 2002 tax rate was also reduced by a favorable IRS audit settlement. Congress is considering new tax legislation that would repeal the extraterritorial income exclusion relating to export sales and enact new rules providing for a tax reduction on profits from the sale of products manufactured in the United States. If such legislation were passed, we do not expect that it would adversely impact the Corporation’s effective tax rate. In the event that this or other tax legislation is enacted, its impact on our deferred tax balances and effective tax rate will be recognized as of the date the new tax rules are enacted. For 2003, we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.1 billion ($2.34 per diluted share) compared to $533 million ($1.18 per diluted share) for 2002. In 2001, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $43 million ($0.10 per diluted share). Discontinued Operations During 2003, the activities of the remaining telecommunications service business held for sale were immaterial and had no impact on earnings. We reported total losses from discontinued operations of $33 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in 2002 and $1.1 billion ($2.52 per diluted share) in 2001. Operating losses of the businesses included in discontinued operations totaled $33 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in 2002 and $62 million ($0.14 per diluted share) in 2001. Discontinued operations for 2002 included losses incurred for wind-down activities related to the global telecommunications services businesses, offset by the reversal of a reserve associated with the sale of Lockheed Martin IMS Corporation (IMS). When recording the sale of IMS in 2001, we established transaction-related reserves to address various indemnity provisions in the sale agreement. The risks associated with certain of these indemnity provisions were resolved and $39 million, net of taxes, was recognized through discontinued operations in 2002. Included in the 2001 loss from discontinued operations was an after-tax charge of $1.3 billion ($3.09 per diluted share) related to our decision to exit the global telecommunications services business. The 2001 results also included an after-tax gain of $309 million ($0.71 per diluted share) from the sale of IMS. Net Earnings (Loss) We reported net earnings of $1.1 billion, or $2.34 per diluted share, in 2003, compared to net earnings of $500 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in 2002 and a net loss of $1 billion ($2.42 per diluted share) in 2001. 57 Discussion of Business Segments As described more fully in Note 16 to the financial statements, we announced the formation of Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), a new business segment, in 2003. With the formation of IS&S, the former Systems Integration business segment is now named Electronic Systems. Also in 2003, we changed the name of our Technology Services business segment to Information & Technology Services (I&TS) to better reflect the scope of its activities. We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, IS&S, and I&TS. The following segment information has been reclassified from amounts previously reported to reflect the current business segments. Net sales have increased in each of our business segments over the last 3 years. Our demonstrated performance and broad portfolio of capabilities have contributed to this growth. In the Aeronautics business segment, sales have increased as we ramped up activities on the F-35 program, delivered more F-16 aircraft and entered low-rate production on the F/A-22 program. During 2003, we increased deliveries of F-16’s to 62 aircraft, from the 21 aircraft delivered in 2002, reflecting the backlog associated with several of our international F-16 customers. We anticipate the F-16 deliveries to be in the range of 70 – 75 aircraft over the next 2 years. The C-130J program was awarded a multi-year award for 60 aircraft during 2003. This award solidifies our production planning and long-term supplier pricing as we complete the initial 119 aircraft program and produce aircraft under the new award. We expect the program will return to profitability in 2004. The Electronic Systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services. Many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. We expect this mix of contract types to continue in the short term, and it may affect the year-to-year comparisons of segment margins and the operating results of the lines of business within Electronic Systems. The Space Systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions, primarily to our U.S. Government customers. Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile System activities, primarily for our U.S. Government customers, are expected to experience steady growth as we work on our existing backlog and any new awards that we may receive. However, the commercial satellite and launch vehicle industries continue to be very competitive. We did receive new orders for both commercial satellites and launch vehicles in 2003; however, the majority of those orders relate to replacement satellites versus an expansion of telecommunications capacity. The Satellites line of business received 5 new commercial satellite orders during 2003. The Launch Services line of business received 11 new awards for launch missions, including 7 Proton, 1 Atlas V and 3 EELV missions. To date, the segment has received 18 EELV mission assignments from the U.S. Government, including the 3 under contract. The activities in the Titan program will continue, though at a lower level than prior years, as we work to complete the remaining 3 missions. The IS&S and the I&TS business segments have strengthened their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense, intelligence and other government customers. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology services to government agencies. 58 In the following tables of financial data, the total of the operating results of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. With respect to the caption “Operating profit,” the reconciling item “Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see discussion below), earnings and losses from equity investments (mainly telecommunications), interest income, costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with FAS 87, and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with U.S. Government CAS, which are reflected in the business segment results. CAS is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements, and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in segment net sales. The results of operations of the segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. 59 (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales Aeronautics $ 10,202 $ 6,471 $ 5,355 Electronic Systems 8,991 8,685 8,079 Space Systems 6,021 5,287 4,801 Integrated Systems & Solutions 3,420 3,015 2,970 Information & Technology Services 3,174 3,104 2,763 Total business segments 31,808 26,562 23,968 Other 16 16 22 $ 31,824 $ 26,578 $ 23,990 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 690 $ 448 $ 329 Electronic Systems 858 875 816 Space Systems 403 279 225 Integrated Systems & Solutions 291 241 225 Information & Technology Services 226 177 114 Total business segments 2,468 2,020 1,709 Unallocated Corporate (expense), net (449 ) (862 ) (602 ) Impact of FAS 142 adoption — — (274 ) $ 2,019 $ 1,158 $ 833 The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was $76.9 billion at December 31, 2003. This amount included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer - Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery / indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts. Funded backlog was $39.1 billion at December 31, 2003. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments. The following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 16 to the financial statements. 60 Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 10,202 $ 6,471 $ 5,355 Operating profit 690 448 329 Backlog at year-end 37,580 35,477 36,149 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 58% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to growth in the Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility lines of business. Approximately half the growth in Combat Aircraft was due to higher volume on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program with a majority of the remaining growth attributable to F-16 programs as a result of increased deliveries. In 2003, 62 F-16’s were delivered, 41 more than in 2002. Increased C-130J deliveries contributed $470 million to the year-over-year growth in sales. There were 15 C-130J deliveries in 2003 compared to 8 deliveries in 2002. Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 21% in 2002 compared to 2001 due to growth in the Combat Aircraft line of business. Approximately 60% of the growth was due to higher volume on the F-35 program with the majority of the remaining increase attributable to the F/A-22 program. Sales in Air Mobility declined $180 million year-over-year, as 7 fewer C-130J deliveries more than offset sales growth in other Air Mobility programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 54% in 2003 compared to the 2002 periods. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the volume increases in Combat Aircraft and performance on other programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 36% in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase primarily resulted from the higher volume in Combat Aircraft. Operating profit for 2002 was negatively affected by $30 million in charges recorded for performance issues on an aircraft modification contract and a change in estimate adjustment related to cost growth on F/A-22 activities. In all periods, the C-130J deliveries do not impact operating profit due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program. Backlog increased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily as a result of booking the C-130J U.S. Government multi-year and international F-16 contracts. 61 Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 8,991 $ 8,685 $ 8,079 Operating profit 858 875 816 Backlog at year-end 17,339 16,034 15,333 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 4% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Sales increases in Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) and Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) more than offset a decline at Platform, Training & Transportation Systems (PT&TS). Increased volume in air defense and tactical missile programs accounted for the majority of M&FC’s $250 million sales growth over 2002. In MS2, the $155 million increase in sales was primarily due to higher volume on radar and surface systems programs. The PT&TS decline of $100 million was the result of lower volume on transportation and security system activities. The majority of this decline is attributable to the 2002 rapid deployment of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) programs. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 8% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Sales increased as a result of higher volume in all three of the segment’s lines of business. Increased sales at M&FC of $285 million were mainly due to higher volumes in air defense and on certain tactical missile programs. PT&TS’ sales increased by $175 million mainly as a result of volume on transportation and security system activities (primarily the TSA programs), which offset declines on platform integration programs. MS2 sales increased by $145 million primarily due to higher volumes on surface systems and radar systems programs. Operating profit for the segment decreased by 2% in 2003 compared to 2002. PT&TS’ operating profit declined by $40 million due to a mix of program maturity and initial development activities on platform integration programs, as well as the impact of the decline in volume in transportation and security system activities. These decreases more than offset a $25 million increase in operating profit primarily attributable to higher volume on air defense programs at M&FC. Operating profit for the segment increased by 7% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by higher volumes at M&FC and PT&TS as noted above in the discussion of sales. The increase in backlog during 2003 over 2002 resulted from increased orders on development programs which more than offset declines in orders on mature production programs. 62 Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 6,021 $ 5,287 $ 4,801 Operating profit 403 279 225 Backlog at year-end 12,813 10,701 10,797 Net sales for Space Systems increased by 14% in 2003 compared to 2002. Sales increased by $570 million in Satellites and $140 million in Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) compared to 2002. The growth in Satellites is due to higher volume on government satellite programs. The growth in S&DMS is attributable to increases in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense activities. In Launch Services, increased Titan activities offset lower sales resulting from a decline in Proton deliveries (2 in 2003 and 4 in 2002). There were 5 Atlas launches in both 2003 and 2002. Net sales for Space Systems increased by 10% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in Satellites of $520 million, due to government satellite activities. This growth was partially offset by sales declines in both S&DMS and Launch Services. Operating profit for the segment increased 44% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Satellites’ operating profit increased by $70 million over the 2002 period mainly due to improved performance on commercial satellite activities and volume increases on government satellite programs, including the impact of a $30 million charge recorded in 2003 related to a handling incident on a NASA satellite program. In Launch Services, operating profit increased by $35 million. The increase was primarily due to improved performance and risk retirement activities on the maturing Titan program, which were partially offset by the impact of a decline in Proton launches in 2003. S&DMS’ operating profit increased by $20 million due to the impact of the volume increases discussed above. Operating profit for the segment increased 24% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Satellites’ operating profit increased $150 million due to reduced commercial satellite losses and the impact of volume increases in government satellite programs when compared to 2001. The commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved (including the benefit of closing out certain manufacturing contracts) and satellite deliveries increased. Also, in the first quarter of 2001, a $40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts. The Satellites increase was partially offset by an $85 million decline in profitability in Launch Services. Reduced volume on government launch vehicle programs, primarily driven by a decrease in Titan activities, accounted for almost all of the decrease in year-over-year operating profit. In 2002, operating profit on Atlas and Proton launch vehicles declined $10 million when compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $55 million on the 3 additional launches in 2002, additional charges of $60 million (net of a favorable contract adjustment of $20 million) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs. The 2001 results included charges for market and pricing pressures, which reduced that year’s operating profit by $145 million. 63 The increase in backlog during 2003 as compared to 2002 was mainly due to an increase in orders for launch services, commercial satellites, and missile defense and classified activities. Integrated Systems & Solutions Integrated Systems & Solutions’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 3,420 $ 3,015 $ 2,970 Operating profit 291 241 225 Backlog at year-end 4,350 3,556 3,874 Net sales for IS&S increased by 13% in 2003 as compared to 2002 and by 2% for 2002 over 2001. For both comparative periods, the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 21% in 2003 as compared to 2002 and by 7% for 2002 over 2001. The increases in operating profit for both comparative periods were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above. Information & Technology Services Information & Technology Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 3,174 $ 3,104 $ 2,763 Operating profit 226 177 114 Backlog at year-end 4,817 4,617 5,116 Net sales for I&TS increased by 2% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The sales increase for the year was mainly the result of volume increases of $110 million in Information Technology, which more than offset lower sales volume totaling $40 million on Defense Services and NASA programs. Information Technology’s results included the net impact of our purchase of the ACS federal government IT business and the concurrent sale of our commercial IT business in November 2003. Net sales for I&TS increased by 12% in 2002 compared to 2001. For the year, the increase in sales was primarily attributable to growth of $240 million in Information Technology, due to increased volume on existing programs and the acquisition of OAO Corporation in December 2001, and $160 million in Defense Services. This growth was partially offset by a decline in sales related to volume on NASA programs. 64 Operating profit for the segment increased by 28% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The operating profit increase was mainly due to the higher volume in Information Technology and improved performance across all lines of business. Operating profit for the segment increased by 55% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase is mainly due to higher volumes and improved performance (primarily on commercial programs) in Information Technology. These increases were partially offset by a combined decrease in operating profit of $30 million on NASA and Defense Services programs. Backlog increased mainly due to the fourth quarter 2003 ACS acquisition and as a result of a higher volume of Information Technology orders. The I&TS segment has a business unit that provides services to the government of Argentina. At December 31, 2003, we had net investments in and advances totaling about $20 million. While we expect that these amounts will be recoverable, there is always the potential that further devaluation of the Argentine peso, deterioration in the Argentine economy or other factors could adversely affect our ability to recover those amounts. Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net The following table shows the components of Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net. For a discussion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and other types of items included in Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net, see Note 16 to the financial statements. For information about items not considered in segment operating performance, see the table under the previous discussion of continuing operations. (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (300 ) $ 243 $ 360 Items not considered in segment operating performance (153 ) (1,112 ) (973 ) Other, net 4 7 11 $ (449 ) $ (862 ) $ (602 ) The difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS and pension expense or income determined in accordance with FAS 87 is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit (FAS/CAS adjustment). The CAS funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments’ cost of goods sold. A majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing, and is consequently included in the segments’ sales. 65 The change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2003 was mainly due to the Corporation reporting FAS pension expense versus FAS pension income in 2002. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS (expense) income, and the resulting FAS/CAS adjustment: (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 FAS 87 (expense) income $ (484 ) $ 156 $ 354 Less: CAS expense and funding (184 ) (87 ) (6 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – (expense) income $ (300 ) $ 243 $ 360 Liquidity and Cash Flows Our management has set forth strategic cash deployment objectives to help ensure that we keep a focus toward growing our core business and increasing shareholder value, and that we are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to do so when they arise. Those objectives include internal investment in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), share repurchases, increases in dividends, debt reduction and management, and acquisitions of businesses that will complement our core operations. The following discussion highlights our cash deployment activities over the past three years as well as our future plans. Operating Activities Our operating cash flow continues to be the primary source of funds for financing our activities. Cash from operations amounted to $1.8 billion in 2003, $2.3 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion in 2001. Our earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, were the driving force behind these cash flows. Our working capital has remained relatively stable the last 2 years, even though our sales have increased by 20 percent in 2003 and 11 percent in 2002 when compared to the prior year. We attribute this to our continued discipline in managing our cash conversion cycle, including the negotiation of performance-based progress payment or advance payment terms in our contracts, inventory management, and billing and collection activities. Cash from operations is net of internal investments we have made in our business relative to independent research and development and bid and proposal activities aggregating $903 million in 2003, $830 million in 2002 and $679 million in 2001. In December 2003, we made a discretionary prepayment of $450 million to our defined benefit pension plan trust that reduced cash from operations, the majority of which will reduce our cash funding requirements for 2004. Our 2002 cash from operations included $117 million from the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim, while in 2001 we paid $655 million of income taxes related to divested businesses. We expect cash from operations to continue to be strong over the next 2 years. 66 Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $687 million in 2003, $662 million in 2002 and $619 million in 2001. We expect our capital expenditures to increase over the next 2 years consistent with the expected growth in our business. Acquisitions and divestitures – In addition to our internal investment in capital expenditures and independent research and development activities, we also selectively identify businesses for potential acquisition. During 2003, we paid approximately $645 million for two businesses that will strengthen our capabilities in providing IT services to defense, intelligence and other government customers. Relative to our pending acquisition of Titan, we plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction principally using existing cash and short-term investment holdings. During the past 3 years, we have divested non-core businesses, primarily those serving commercial markets. We received cash of approximately $110 million in 2003 from the sale of our commercial IT business, $134 million in 2002 from the sale of certain discontinued telecommunications businesses and $825 million in 2001 from the sale of IMS. In December 2003, Inmarsat Ventures, Ltd., a venture in which we held a 14% interest, was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction. In exchange for our interest, we received cash of $114 million and a 14% ownership interest in the new Inmarsat holding company, Inmarsat Holdings, Ltd., valued at $96 million. We recorded a deferred gain of $42 million from the transaction, which we would expect to recognize at such time as we sell all or a portion of our interest in the new company. Financing Activities Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long-term debt. In 2003, we issued $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior debentures that bear interest at three-month LIBOR less 25 basis points, reset quarterly (the interest rate on this debt at December 31, 2003 was 0.93%). We used the proceeds from that issuance, along with cash provided by operations, to repay $2.2 billion of debt in advance of its maturity and retire other high cost debt. We used $175 million of cash for debt issuance and repayment costs to complete those transactions. Interest rates on the debt we retired early ranged from 7.25% to 8.375%. We also used $110 million in 2002 and $2.6 billion in 2001, to repay our long-term debt. The result has been a decrease in our total debt balance from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2000 to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2003, and a decrease in interest paid from $707 million in 2001 to $519 million in 2003. We expect interest payments to decline further in 2004 when the full impact of the debt repayment and refinancing activities in 2003 will be reflected in our operating results. Scheduled debt maturities are $136 million in 2004 and $15 million in 2005. We currently do not expect any material early repayments of long-term debt over the next 2 years. Share repurchases and dividends – We also used cash to opportunistically repurchase 10.7 million of our common shares for $482 million in 2003 and 1.0 million of our common shares for $50 million in 2002. These transactions were pursuant to our share repurchase program initiated in 2002. In February 2004, an additional 20 million shares were authorized for repurchase under the program. As a result of the increase, a total of 31.3 million shares may be repurchased in the future under the program. Shareholders were paid dividends of $261 million in 2003, $199 million in 2002 and $192 million in 2001. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2003 and $0.22 per share for the last quarter of 2003. Quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share were paid during 2002 and 2001. We are currently expecting to deploy a majority of the cash we generate from operations over the next 2 years (after capital expenditures) to repurchase shares and pay dividends. 67 Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2003, our total long-term debt amounted to $6.2 billion. Our long-term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures. The newly issued $1.0 billion of convertible debentures discussed in more detail below has a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. The balance of our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates. Through our repayment activities, our long-term debt balance has declined from a balance of $9.9 billion at December 31, 2000. During the last 3 years, we improved our debt-to-total capital ratio from 58% at December 31, 2000 to 48% at December 31, 2003. Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $6.8 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of about $900 million from December 31, 2002. Net earnings, stock plan activities and a reduction of our minimum pension liability, more than offset our payment of dividends and share repurchase activities. The $1.0 billion in floating rate convertible debentures we issued in 2003 are due in 2033. They bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR less 25 basis points, reset quarterly. Accordingly, to the extent three-month LIBOR increases or decreases by 1%, our interest expense would increase or decrease by $10 million on a pretax basis. Interest on the debentures is payable quarterly through August 15, 2008, after which the interest will accrue as part of the value of the debenture and will be payable, along with the principal amount, at maturity. The debentures are convertible by their holders into our common stock in certain limited circumstances as outlined in the indenture agreement. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. We have the right to redeem any or all of the debentures at any time after August 15, 2008. In 2003, we repaid a total of $2.2 billion of long-term debt, including scheduled and early debt repayments, and the repayment of $130 million related to our guarantee of Space Imaging, LLC’s borrowings under its credit facility. We repaid several issuances of our long-term debt early through the completion of tender offers, redemption of certain callable debt securities and open market purchases of other outstanding debt issuances. Through these activities, we repaid debt totaling $1.4 billion with interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 8.375% and maturities ranging from 2006 to 2026. In connection with the early repayments, we recorded losses in 2003, net of state income tax benefits, totaling $146 million. The losses reduced net earnings by $96 million ($0.21 per diluted share). At the end of 2003, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility under which no borrowings were outstanding. This credit facility will expire in November 2006. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate (as defined). Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 68 2003. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. At December 31, 2003, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle other long-term liabilities. Payments due under these long-term obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1–3 years 4–5 years After 5years Long-term debt and capital lease obligations $ 6,208 $ 136 $ 253 $ 725 $ 5,094 Operating lease commitments 1,135 254 349 219 313 Purchase obligations 1,660 827 553 207 73 Other long-term liabilities 1,051 120 202 145 584 Total contractual cash obligations $ 10,054 $ 1,337 $ 1,357 $ 1,296 $ 6,064 Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Purchase obligations include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to sub-contractors, outsourcing arrangements, and non-cancelable commitments for property, plant and equipment. Generally, amounts for purchase obligations in the preceding table exclude contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. These commitments are excluded because the U.S. Government would be required to pay us for any costs we incur if they terminate our contracts with them “for convenience” pursuant to the FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from a U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated 69 the contract for convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform sub-contract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. If so, amounts related to purchase obligations entered into in support of those contracts were excluded from the preceding table. To the extent contracts with customers do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers, related purchase obligation amounts are included in the table. Amounts related to “Other long-term liabilities” in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2003. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans and environmental liabilities. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a PRP under an agreement entered into in 2000. We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts to provide products and services to customers. At December 31, 2003, we had contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and other arrangements, as follows: Commitment Expiration per Period (In millions) TotalCommit-ment Less than1 year 1–3 years 4–5 years After 5years Surety bonds (a) $ 253 $ 61 $ 68 $ 124 $ — Standby letters of credit (a) 261 180 57 13 11 Guarantees 4 3 1 — — Total commitments $ 518 $ 244 $ 126 $ 137 $ 11 (a) Approximately $43 million of surety bonds in the “less than 1 year” period, and approximately $117 million and $15 million of standby letters of credit in the “less than 1 year” and “1–3 year” periods, respectively, are expected to automatically renew for additional 1-2 year periods until completion of the contractual obligation. We have issued standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $3.9 billion related to advances received from customers and/or to secure our performance under long-term contracts. Amounts included in the table above totaling $514 million are those amounts over and above advances received from customers which are recorded in the balance sheet as either offsets against inventories or in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. Of the $3.4 billion recorded in the balance sheet, approximately $2 billion relates to a standby letter of credit to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. This letter of credit is available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance. Similar to the letter of credit for the F-16 contract, letters of credit and surety bonds for other contracts are available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance. 70 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources, are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs, projected over the next 3 years. Consistent with our desire to generate cash to reduce debt and invest in our core businesses, we expect that, depending on prevailing financial, market and economic conditions, we will continue to explore the sale of non-core businesses, passive equity investments and surplus real estate. Equity Investments In 2002, we recorded impairment charges, net of state income tax benefits, totaling $776 million related to our investments in Intelsat, Ltd. (Intelsat), Inmarsat and New Skies Satellites, N.V. (New Skies). The charges reduced net earnings by $504 million ($1.12 per diluted share). The charges were recorded primarily due to unfavorable trends in the satellite services and telecommunications industries that were not expected to be resolved in the near term. Intelsat, Inmarsat and New Skies are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC decisions and policies have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on these companies. The Open-Market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act (the ORBIT Act), passed by Congress in 2000, established deadlines for Intelsat and Inmarsat to complete initial public offerings. Based on congressional and regulatory extensions received to date, and unless otherwise extended by Congress, each is required to complete their initial public offerings by June 30, 2004. Their ability to do so may be impacted by changes in trends and market conditions in the telecommunications industry, as well as in the capital markets. If those deadlines are not met or extended by further amendments to the legislation, the FCC may limit access by U.S. users to the satellite capacity of the privatized entities for some services. If this were to occur, the value of our investments could be adversely affected. In December 2003, Inmarsat was acquired in a leveraged buyout transaction and, in doing so, believes it has complied with the ORBIT Act requirements. There is no assurance that the FCC will accept Inmarsat’s position that it has satisfied the ORBIT Act requirement by completing a leveraged buyout transaction. In January 2004, Intelsat announced its intention to conduct an initial public offering of its shares in an amount up to $500 million, and expects the offering to occur on or before June 30, 2004. In December 2002, we recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $163 million related to our investment in Space Imaging, LLC and our guarantee of up to $150 million of Space Imaging’s borrowings under a credit facility that matured on March 30, 2003. At December 31, 2002, we increased current maturities of long-term debt by $150 million representing our estimated obligation under the guarantee. On March 31, 2003, we paid $130 million to acquire Space Imaging’s outstanding borrowings under Space Imaging’s credit facility, and the guarantee was eliminated. We therefore reversed, net of state income taxes, approximately $19 million of the charge recorded in December 2002, representing the unutilized portion of the credit facility covered by our guarantee. This gain increased 2003 net earnings by $13 million ($0.03 per diluted share). In 2001, we recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $361 million related to the impairment of our investment in Loral Space & Communications Ltd. (see Note 8 to the financial statements). The charge reduced net earnings by $235 million ($0.54 per diluted 71 share). In July 2003, Loral Space and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In the third quarter of 2003, we sold our ownership interest in Loral Space. The sale did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are an unsecured creditor of Loral Space in the bankruptcy proceeding. Loral Space has made a claim that they are entitled to a refund of payments made to us under various terminated launch service contracts. We believe that the claim is without merit and that we are entitled to retain the amounts under the terms of the contracts. We do not expect these events to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. In 2001, we recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $367 million related to impairment in the value of our investment in Astrolink International LLC. We also recorded charges of approximately $20 million, net of state income tax benefits, in cost of sales for certain other costs related to Astrolink. On a combined basis, these charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by approximately $267 million ($0.62 per diluted share). In January 2003, we entered into an agreement with Astrolink’s other members to restructure Astrolink. As part of the transaction, Liberty Satellite & Technology, a subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation, had an option to acquire Astrolink’s assets and pursue a business plan to build a one- or two-satellite system. On October 24, 2003, Liberty Satellite & Technology notified us that they would not exercise the option to acquire Astrolink’s assets and build the satellite system. As a result, as part of the restructuring agreement, Astrolink’s procurement contracts were terminated, and we acquired the remaining ownership interests in Astrolink. The restructuring also entailed the settlement of existing claims related to termination of Astrolink’s procurement contracts with its members, certain of their affiliates and other vendors. Under these settlements, we retained our work in process. Completion of the restructuring did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In 2001 we recorded charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $232 million related to commitments to and impairment in the values of investments in satellite joint ventures, primarily Asia Cellular Satellite System and Americom Asia-Pacific, LLC. The charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by $153 million ($0.35 per diluted share). Realization and valuation of our investments in equity securities may be affected by an investee’s ability to obtain adequate funding, including through public and private sales of its debt and equity securities, and execute its business plans, as well as by general market conditions, industry considerations specific to the investee’s business, and/or other factors. The inability of an investee to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our earnings in the periods affected by those events. 72 Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2001, we announced that we would exit our global telecommunications services business and recorded related charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $1.4 billion. The charges reduced net earnings by about $1.3 billion ($3.09 per diluted share). The charges related to global telecommunications services businesses held for sale and exit costs for the elimination of the administrative function supporting the global telecommunications businesses and investments. Amounts recorded included about $1.2 billion related to impairment of goodwill, with the remainder related to impairment of some of the long-lived assets employed by foreign businesses held for sale and costs associated with elimination of administrative functions. We completed sales of all of the businesses classified as held for sale in 2002 with the exception of Lockheed Martin Intersputnik (LMI). Those transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We reached an agreement to sell LMI in the third quarter of 2002; however, in April 2003, the agreement was terminated. We are continuing to treat LMI as a discontinued operation, as we are still holding and actively marketing the business for sale, and there are interested potential buyers. The operating results of LMI had no impact on the statement of earnings in 2003, and its assets and liabilities, which represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets and liabilities at the end of 2003, were included in our balance sheet in other current assets and other current liabilities. We do not expect that the operating results of LMI (until such time as we sell the business), or its ultimate sale, will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We completed the sale of IMS, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for $825 million in cash in August 2001. This transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $476 million and increased net earnings by $309 million ($0.71 per diluted share). The results of IMS’ operations, as well as the gain on the sale, were classified as discontinued operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include short-term investments and long-term debt. Our long-term debt obligations, other than the $1.0 billion in convertible debentures issued in 2003, are generally not callable until maturity. We sometimes use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. At year-end 2003, we had agreements in place to swap fixed interest rates on approximately $70 million of our long-term debt for variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges of the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2003, the fair values of interest rate swap agreements outstanding were not material. The amounts of gains and losses from changes in the fair values of the swap agreements were entirely offset by those from changes in the fair value of the associated debt obligations. Changes in swap rates would affect the market value of the agreements, but those changes in value would be offset by changes in the value of the underlying debt obligations. 73 We use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of the cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions, and related gains and losses on the contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized currently. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended, were not material. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage those entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2003, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on the evaluation, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Annual Report includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, notes to those financial statements and a five-year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our company and focus your review by directing you to some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year. Lockheed Martin’s Business Lockheed Martin Corporation principally researches, designs, develops, manufactures, integrates, operates and sustains advanced technology systems, products and services. We mainly serve customers in domestic and international defense, civil markets, and homeland security, and about 80% of our sales over the past three years have been to agencies of the U.S. Government. Our main areas of focus are in the defense, space, intelligence/homeland security, and government information technology markets. Our commercial activities represent about 4% of our sales in 2004 and primarily relate to launch services and satellites. We operate in five principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). As a lead systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems, including integrated net-centric solutions, to missiles, aircraft, spacecraft and launch services. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 28 through 50) – provides management’s view about industry trends, risks and uncertainties relating to Lockheed Martin, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations, including discussions about the key performance drivers of each of our business segments, our financial position and cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events or transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 51 through 53) – include the following: • A report from our management, indicating our responsibility for financial reporting and the financial statements, and for a system of internal control over financial reporting and our assessment of its effectiveness; • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which includes their opinions on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, which includes their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. The report includes their opinion on our financial statements being in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Financial statements (pages 54 through 57) – include our consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the last three years, and our balance sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Notes to the financial statements (pages 58 through 84) – provide insight into and are an integral part of our financial statements. There are explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain of the captions on the financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 28 Highlights The financial section of our Annual Report describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of the consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Page 34 Post-retirement benefit plans Page 35 and page 71 Environmental matters Page 36, page 59 and page 77 Discussion of business segments Page 40 and page 77 Liquidity and cash flows Page 45 and page 56 Capital structure and resources Page 47, page 55 and page 57 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 48 and page 75 Stock-based compensation Page 50, page 60 and page 69 29 Industry Considerations Defense Business Considerations The markets for defense and related advanced technology systems for 2005 and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism, through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war. The realities of the war on terrorism have focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and better communication and interplay between law enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military services. At the same time, our nation’s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more capabilities-based structure, which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility, stronger space capabilities, enhanced missile defense and improved information systems capabilities and security. We anticipate that the next Congressionally mandated Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) undertaken by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) will reinforce and advance efforts at the DoD to refocus activities toward joint operations, net-centric command and control, and integrated capabilities for the armed forces. To address this customer priority, we formed the Integrated Systems & Solutions business segment and established the Center for Innovation to help us better focus our integrated solutions capabilities across the Corporation and enhance our ability to serve as a lead partner with the DoD. The President’s budget for fiscal year 2006 and beyond represents an agenda for a second term in office, and presents a framework to reduce the federal budget deficit while aggressively prosecuting the global war on terrorism. The rate of growth for budget increases at the DoD is reduced, while spending across non-defense federal agencies is projected to decline through 2011. These changes in the White House budget plan reflect a commitment to cut the federal budget deficit in half by 2009, and sentiment expressed by the Federal Reserve that sustained federal deficits could hamper economic growth. The Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) submitted with the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2006 projects a strong commitment to research and development of transformational capabilities across the military services, while reducing quantities of near-term systems compared to previous projections. As has been widely reported, the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2006 includes $419.3 billion for overall defense spending and proposes reductions in funding for a number of existing defense programs, including out-year reductions to the F/A-22 and C-130J programs and termination in 2006 of the Joint Common Missile and other programs in which Lockheed Martin participates. We are actively participating in and monitoring discussions regarding these proposals, but are unable to predict the extent to which these proposals ultimately will be approved as part of the 2006 or subsequent budgets approved by Congress or what the ultimate impact on Lockheed Martin would be. Many key decisions on future program quantities and force structure will be reached through the QDR and the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions to be undertaken in 2005. Budget pressures within DoD also may create additional opportunities for business process management and outsourcing of service functions by the military services, expanding the scope of private sector contracting opportunities at the DoD. In September 2004, Congress passed an initial $25 billion supplemental appropriation to defray costs for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom during the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. The Administration has requested an additional $80 billion to meet these costs through the remainder of 2005. These supplemental appropriations enabled the DoD to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs, versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. Congress will likely act on this further 2005 supplemental request by April 2005. While there is no assurance that additional supplemental appropriations will be approved by Congress, we do not anticipate that sustained operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will materially impact the procurement and research and development budget levels projected in the near term. Our broad mix of programs and capabilities gives us the ability to support the needs of the various agencies of the U.S. Government that require our solutions. Our major programs and capabilities include: missile defense; space intelligence; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); air mobility aircraft; and air-power projection/precision-strike capability. In terms of size and long-term potential impact, two of our more significant programs are the F/A-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force recently completed the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for the F/A-22 air dominance, attack and multi-mission combat aircraft. The determination that the Raptor is operationally suitable will permit the DoD to complete the upcoming Defense Acquisition Board review which, if successful, will authorize additional production of the F/A-22. We are also represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the AEGIS Weapon System program, Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle program. In the areas of space intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, and the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H), and in classified 30 programs and battle management command and control capabilities. In airlift, we have the C-130J program and are under contract to upgrade the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. Many of these programs are large and require funding over several budget cycles. As discussed earlier, there are risks associated with these and other large, highly visible programs subject to appropriation by Congress that, because of their size, could be expected to become potential targets for reduction or extension of funding to pay for other programs. The 2005 QDR will assess current and future capabilities required by the DoD, and may result in program and force structure changes to be reflected in future defense budget requests. We continue to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and E-Government solutions for our customers, including the U.S. Social Security Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the DoD. We provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance and enterprise solutions. Consistent with the President’s agenda, the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public/private competitions, such as the recent selection of Lockheed Martin to operate the Federal Aviation Administration’s Automated Flight Services Station Network. In addition, recent trends have indicated an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. In addition, the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports and waterways security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, information systems security and other technical systems solutions. During the 1990s, companies in our industry reacted to shrinking defense budgets for procurement and research and development by combining to maintain critical mass. More recently, we have sought to expand into adjacent product lines such as with the Littoral Combat Ship program and the recently awarded Marine One U.S. Presidential Helicopter contract. In addition, we have focused our efforts on select core acquisitions, cost savings and improving efficiency, as well as generating cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation. Through these activities, we have been able to pass along savings to our customers, mainly the DoD. Non-U.S. defense budgets have generally been flat or declining over the past decade. As a result, consolidation has also been occurring in the European aerospace industry, resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors. 31 Space Business The commercial launch vehicle marketplace remains very competitive due mainly to lower-than-expected demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. The reduction in demand has resulted in pricing pressures in both the launch vehicle and satellite markets. We received new orders for both commercial satellites and launch vehicles in both 2003 and 2004. The above factors have impacted orders for our commercial launch vehicles, including the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV or Atlas V), our next generation launch vehicle program in which we have made significant investments over the past few years. The Atlas V is available for both commercial and U.S. Government use. This program has required investment of funds for research and development, start-up and other nonrecurring costs, and launch facilities. Some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the U.S. Government. Commercial orders to-date for the Atlas V launch vehicle have been lower than originally expected and at lower prices. However, we have received a total of 19 launch assignments from the U.S. Government (including those described in the following paragraph), six of which are under contract and in backlog. The U.S. Government has been awarding missions incrementally as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy for future national missions. We had six Atlas launches in 2004, including our fourth Atlas V commercial launch. As of year-end 2004, the Atlas family of launch vehicles had a record of 74 consecutive successful launches. In July 2003, the U.S. Air Force announced that our competitor in the EELV competition had violated the Procurement Integrity Act. As a result of that determination, the Air Force reassigned seven launch vehicles from the initial competition (referred to as “Buy I”) to us and removed our exclusion from West Coast launches. At the same time, the Air Force assigned us three new West Coast launches. To prepare for these, we are upgrading West Coast launch facilities, which requires further investment in the EELV program (see Note 5 to the financial statements). The investment will be recovered through pricing of the West Coast launches. The seven reassigned launches are expected to occur over the 2006 through 2009 time period. It is currently anticipated that the West Coast launch facilities will be operational during 2005. The U.S. Government wants to maintain assured access to space to the maximum extent possible and has recognized the need to fund additional EELV infrastructure costs created by the weaker-than-originally-anticipated commercial market for launch services. The assured access monies approved in the 2005 defense budget will cover a portion of these costs. There is no assurance that the assured access funding provided for in the President’s fiscal year 2006 budget request will be approved by Congress. Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International, Inc. (LKEI), a joint venture we have with two Russian government-owned space firms, has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets from a launch site in Kazakhstan. Commercial Atlas and Proton launch services are marketed around the world through International Launch Services (ILS), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and LKEI. We consolidate the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest. We received six new awards for launches on Proton vehicles in 2004. Contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer prior to launch. At the end of 2004, $348 million of advances received from customers for Proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability in our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. A sizeable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for Proton launch services are sent to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev), the manufacturer of the launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in Russia. If a contracted launch service is not provided, a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to our customer. In addition, we have sent advances to Khrunichev for launches we purchased which have not yet been assigned to our customers. The advances sent to Khrunichev are included on our balance sheet in inventories. Advances for launches not under contract are subject to an agreement entered into in 2002 which provides for reduced future launch payments from us to Khrunichev, contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a minimum number of actual launches each year. At year-end 2004, payments to Khrunichev included in inventories totaled $301 million. Our ability to realize the remaining amounts may be affected by Khrunichev’s ability to provide the launch services and the political environment in Russia. Through the end of 2004, launch services through LKEI and ILS have been provided according to contract terms. The Corporation has entered into an agreement with RD AMROSS, a joint venture of the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation and the Russian firm NPO Energomash, for the purchase, subject to certain conditions, of RD-180 booster engines for use in the Corporation’s Atlas launch vehicles. Terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to RD AMROSS upon the achievement of certain milestones in the manufacturing process. Payments of $64 million made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the Corporation’s inventories at December 31, 2004. In prior years, the U.S. Department of State has authorized one year International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) license extensions authorizing Lockheed Martin to have discussions with NPO Energomash on the RD-180 Engine and its use on the Atlas V 32 launch vehicle. In 2004, the U.S. Department of State issued a three year license extension, therefore mitigating the need for the annual license renewal process, and providing for longer term stability for Atlas V sales. In addition, the Proton launch services license also was extended for three years. As discussed above, the commercial satellite market has continued to experience pricing pressures due to excess capacity. However, in the past two years, we have received seven commercial satellite orders and are in active discussions for additional satellite orders. We expect to continue to control costs in our commercial satellite manufacturing business while keeping our focus on providing a reliable product. In addition to commercial activity, we also have received new orders for government satellites in 2004 including the MUOS program and certain classified activities. A significant portion of the work on the MUOS program will be performed in our commercial satellite manufacturing facility. Other Business Considerations As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Changes in government procurement policies and practices over the past several years, such as increases in the progress payment rate and the use of performance-based payments, have had a positive effect on our financial position and cash flows. But we are still exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. We provide products and services to government agencies such as the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and Health and Human Services, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration. Although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets, they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, as well as other risks unique to the particular programs. Although indemnification by the U.S. Government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We do plan to seek, and in certain cases have obtained, limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the “SAFETY Act” provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. During 2004, we received SAFETY Act approvals for two such activities. In the event we were to provide homeland security-related products and services to a customer without such qualification, we would not be afforded the benefit of the SAFETY Act’s cap on tort liability or U.S. Government indemnification. Other risks unique to the civil government markets may include development of competing products, technological feasibility and product obsolescence. We provide products and services to NASA, including the Space Shuttle program, mainly through our Space Systems and Information & Technology Services business segments. We also have a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. We are committed to securing return to flight of the Space Shuttle in 2005. We expect to compete for NASA programs related to the new Space Exploration Vision announced by the President and funded by Congress for fiscal year 2005. We have entered into various joint venture, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business, including commercial space. Some of these business arrangements include foreign partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export 33 privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition A large part of our business is derived from long-term contracts for development, production and service activities which we account for consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) audit and accounting guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the AICPA’s Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract. Generally, we record long-term, fixed-price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program, Atlas and Proton launch vehicle programs, and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F/A-22 Raptor program and the AEGIS Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low level of initial production units in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter system development and demonstration (SDD) program and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements in accounting for long-term contracts. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Incentives and award fees related to performance on contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Award fees are recorded based on actual awards and anticipated performance. The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government, and therefore not necessarily on market-based factors. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under agreements reached with the U.S. Government. 34 Products and services provided under long-term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business. Therefore, the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel separately from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans), and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions. Those rules require that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following fiscal year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and, in the case of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, past investment experience, judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. An example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in 2004. We reassess the discount rate assumption at the end of each year. Based on our review of interest rates at the end of the year, we lowered our discount rate assumption to 5.75% at year-end 2004, compared to 6.25% used at the end of 2003. This change, together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years, resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for 2005 will increase by approximately 25% to 30% as compared to 2004 expense. The change in the discount rate is the main factor causing this result. The decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate increased the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $160 million. This annual review of our pension plan assumptions also affects the pension liability recorded in our balance sheet. At the end of each of the last three years, we recorded a noncash after-tax adjustment in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for most of our pension plans. These adjustments were calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and were determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for each plan to the fair value of that plan’s assets. The amount by which the ABO exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan, must be recorded as a minimum pension liability, with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset, if appropriate, and a reduction to stockholders’ equity. In 2004, the adjustment we recorded reduced stockholders’ equity by about $275 million, mainly due to the change in the discount rate at December 31, 2004. This comes after stockholders’ equity increased by about $300 million from the adjustment made in 2003, mainly due to favorable asset returns for the year. At the end of 2002, the adjustment reduced stockholders’ equity by $1.5 billion. These minimum pension liability adjustments did not impact earnings. The amount of the minimum pension liability is computed at each year-end and could decrease or increase depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are a major factor in determining our funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore are recognized in our net sales. The total funding requirement for pension plans under CAS in 2004 was $289 million. For 2005, we expect our funding requirements under CAS to increase. Also in 2005, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code rules. Any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and therefore are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2004 and 2003, we made discretionary 35 prepayments of $485 million and $450 million, respectively, to the pension trust, which reduced or will reduce our cash funding requirements in the following year. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Since the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. See the discussion of “Net Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income” under “Discussion of Business Segments.” The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law in December 2003. Under the Act, Medicare will provide a prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. Based on current estimates and pending review of the final regulations related to the Act, we calculated a reduction in our retiree healthcare benefit obligation of $295 million at December 31, 2004. The impact on net earnings of the reduction in the net periodic post-retirement benefits cost for 2005, after application of government contracting regulations, is not expected to be material. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental clean-up issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the Environmental Protection Agency or by a state agency. We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to, along with other factors, difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, and agreements between PRPs to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental clean-up activities usually cover several years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean-up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise, we project costs over a reasonable time frame not to exceed 20 years. Given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean-up and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, however, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. 36 At the end of 2004, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was approximately $420 million. About 60% of the liability relates to sites in Redlands, Burbank and Glendale, California, and in Great Neck, New York, mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The remainder of the liability related to other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated. We have recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for U.S. Government businesses. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales. Any recoveries we receive would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government sales and cost of sales. 37 Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. This is accomplished internally, through our independent research and development activities or with acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses that complement our current portfolio and allow expansion into adjacent markets or access to new technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions during the past several years. In February 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The SYTEX Group, Inc. (TSGI) for net consideration of $462 million. TSGI provides information technology solutions and technical support services to the DoD and other federal agencies. The transaction is subject to government approvals, including a review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and satisfaction of other closing conditions. We expect the transaction will close in early 2005. In June 2004, we terminated our September 2003 merger agreement, as amended, with The Titan Corporation, as certain closing conditions were not met on or before June 25, 2004 as required. We may also explore the sale of non-core businesses and surplus real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of net sales and operating results will provide an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” which follows, will describe the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated results for 2004, 2003 and 2002. 38 For 2004, net sales were $35.5 billion, a 12% increase over 2003 sales. Sales for 2003 were $31.8 billion, an increase of 20% compared to 2002. Sales increased in all segments as compared to the prior year for the third straight year. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 80% of our sales for 2004, compared to 78% in 2003 and 80% in 2002. For 2004, 2003 and 2002 the operating (loss) profit items in the table below, in addition to other items, were included in “Net Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income” (see the related “Discussion of Business Segments” below). (In millions, except per share data) Operating (Loss) Profit Net(Loss) Earnings (Loss) Earnings Per Share Year ended December 31, 2004 Charge for Pit 9 litigation $ (180 ) $ (117 ) $ (0.26 ) Charge for early retirement of debt (154 ) (100 ) (0.22 ) Gain on sale of interest in New Skies 91 59 0.13 Gain on sale of COMSAT General business 28 4 0.01 Benefit from closure of an IRS examination — 144 0.32 $ (215 ) $ (10 ) $ (0.02 ) Year ended December 31, 2003 Charge for early retirement of debt $ (146 ) $ (96 ) $ (0.21 ) Charge related to exit from the commercial mail sorting business (41 ) (27 ) (0.06 ) Gain on partial reversal of Space Imaging charge 19 13 0.03 Gain on sale of the commercial IT business 15 8 0.02 $ (153 ) $ (102 ) $ (0.22 ) Year ended December 31, 2002 Write-down of telecommunications investments $ (776 ) $ (504 ) $ (1.12 ) Charge related to a Russian launch services provider (173 ) (112 ) (0.25 ) Write-down of investment in Space Imaging and charge related to recording of guarantee (163 ) (106 ) (0.23 ) Benefit from R&D tax credit settlement — 90 0.20 $ (1,112 ) $ (632 ) $ (1.40 ) Our operating profit for 2004 was $2.1 billion, an increase of 3% compared to 2003. Our operating profit for 2003 was $2.0 billion, an increase of 74% compared to 2002. Interest expense for 2004 was $425 million, $62 million lower than in 2003 mainly due to reductions in our debt portfolio. Interest expense for 2003 was $487 million, $94 million lower than the amount for 2002. This was primarily the result of reductions in our debt portfolio and the favorable impact of having issued $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible notes in August 2003 to replace higher cost fixed rate debt. Our effective tax rates were 23.9% for 2004, 31.3% for 2003 and 7.7% for 2002. A $144 million reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination reduced our 2004 tax rate. A $90 million tax benefit related to settlement of a research and development tax credit claim reduced our tax rate for 2002. Tax benefits related to export sales, tax refund initiatives, and adjustments to true-up actual tax return liabilities reduced our tax rate for each of the three years. Recently enacted tax legislation has repealed the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion relating to export sales. Over a transition period beginning in 2005, the new tax rules phase-out the ETI exclusion benefit and provide for a new tax deduction in computing profits from the sale of products manufactured in the United States. The tax benefit we realize from the new legislation is expected to be substantially equivalent to the benefit we realized under the repealed ETI exclusion. Net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the third straight year. We reported net earnings of $1.3 billion ($2.83 per share) in 2004, compared to net earnings of $1.1 billion ($2.34 per share) in 2003. Net earnings for 2002 were $500 million ($1.11 per share), and reflected losses from discontinued operations of $33 million ($0.07 per share). 39 Discussion of Business Segments We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S) and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). Net sales have increased in each of our business segments over the last three years. Our demonstrated performance and broad portfolio of capabilities have contributed to this growth. In the Aeronautics business segment, sales growth has been driven by Combat Aircraft activities, which made up over 80% of this business segment’s revenue. Sales on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program have increased as we completed the third full year on the SDD contract. During 2004, we initiated a weight reduction effort focusing on the Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft. Approximately 3,000 pounds were removed from the STOVL design and significant weight-savings were applied to the other two variants. The F/A-22 program has contributed to our sales growth as we continue to build aircraft under low-rate initial production contracts. In 2004, 15 F/A-22s, our highest annual total to date on the program, were delivered including the final six Production Lot 1 aircraft and the first nine Production Lot 2 aircraft. Activities on our F-16 programs increased as we delivered 83 aircraft during 2004 as compared to 62 aircraft in 2003. Activity on the C-130J program included delivery of 13 aircraft in 2004, which represented the near completion of the initial 119 aircraft program and delivery of the first two aircraft under the multi-year award for 60 aircraft that was received in 2003. We began to recognize profits on the 13 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2004. The Electronics Systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services. Many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. The mix of contract types varies, and we expect this to continue in the short term; it may affect the year-to-year comparisons of segment margins and the operating results of the lines of businesses within Electronic Systems. The Space Systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions, primarily to our U.S. Government customers. Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile System activities are expected to experience steady growth. The commercial satellite and launch vehicle industries continue to be very competitive, with resulting pricing pressures. The activities in the Titan launch vehicle program will continue, though at a lower level than prior years, as we work to complete the remaining two U.S. Government missions. The IS&S and I&TS business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense, intelligence and other government customers. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies. In the following tables of financial data, the total of the operating results of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. With respect to the caption “Operating profit,” the reconciling item “Net unallocated Corporate expense” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see discussion below), earnings and losses from equity investments, interest income, costs for certain stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with FAS 87, and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with U.S. Government CAS, which are reflected in the business segment results. CAS is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements, and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in segment net sales. The results of operations of the segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. 40 This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales Aeronautics $ 11,781 $ 10,202 $ 6,471 Electronic Systems 9,724 8,991 8,685 Space Systems 6,357 6,021 5,287 Integrated Systems & Solutions 3,850 3,420 3,015 Information & Technology Services 3,801 3,174 3,104 Total business segments 35,513 31,808 26,562 Other 13 16 16 $ 35,526 $ 31,824 $ 26,578 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 899 $ 690 $ 448 Electronic Systems 969 858 875 Space Systems 489 403 279 Integrated Systems & Solutions 334 291 241 Information & Technology Services 285 226 177 Total business segments 2,976 2,468 2,020 Net unallocated Corporate expense (887 ) (449 ) (862 ) $ 2,089 $ 2,019 $ 1,158 Segment Operating Profit (In millions) The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was $74 billion at December 31, 2004. This amount included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer - Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $40.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 15 to the financial statements. 41 Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 11,781 $ 10,202 $ 6,471 Operating profit 899 690 448 Backlog at year-end 30,489 37,580 35,477 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. The majority of the increase in sales, $1.5 billion, was due to higher volume on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-16 and F/A-22 Combat Aircraft programs. In 2004, 83 F-16s were delivered, 21 more than in 2003. The remaining increase in sales was mainly due to higher C-5 activities in Air Mobility. There were 13 C-130J deliveries in 2004 compared to 15 deliveries in 2003. Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 58% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to growth in Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. Approximately half the growth in Combat Aircraft was due to higher volume on the F-35 program with a majority of the remaining growth attributable to F-16 programs as a result of increased deliveries. In 2003, 62 F-16s were delivered, 41 more than in 2002. Increased C-130J deliveries contributed $470 million to the year-over-year growth in sales. There were 15 C-130J deliveries in 2003 compared to eight deliveries in 2002. Operating profit for the segment increased by 30% in 2004 compared to 2003. Combat Aircraft operating profit increased $95 million primarily as a result of higher sales volume on the programs discussed above and improved performance on the F/A-22 program. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to $85 million in operating profit recognized on the C-130Js delivered in 2004. The Corporation began recognizing profits on C-130J deliveries in 2004 upon resolution of certain technical aircraft performance risks, manufacturing performance improvements and the achievement of stable production as a result of securing a multi-year contract in 2003. Operating profit for the segment increased by 54% in 2003 compared to the 2002 periods. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the volume increases in Combat Aircraft and performance on other programs. In 2003 and 2002, the C-130J deliveries did not impact operating profit due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program. Backlog decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily as a result of sales volume on the F-35 and F-16 programs as well as deliveries of C-130J aircraft. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 9,724 $ 8,991 $ 8,685 Operating profit 969 858 875 Backlog at year-end 18,239 17,339 16,034 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 8% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in sales was due to higher volume in Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) and Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). Higher volume on surface systems programs accounted for most of MS2’s sales growth of $450 million. M&FC’s sales increased $265 million, primarily due to higher volume on fire control and tactical missile programs. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 4% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Sales increases in M&FC and MS2 more than offset a decline at Platform, Training & Transportation Systems (PT&TS). Increased volume in air defense and tactical missile programs accounted for the majority of M&FC’s $250 million sales growth over 2002. In MS2, the $155 million increase in sales was primarily due to higher volume on radar and surface systems programs. The PT&TS decline of $100 million was the result of lower volume on transportation and security system activities. The majority of this decline is attributable to the 2002 rapid deployment of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 13% in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating profit increased $145 million due to improved performance on tactical missile and fire control programs at M&FC and on radar programs at MS2. The decrease in operating profit at PT&TS was due to a $25 million loss provision recorded in the third quarter of 2004 on certain international simulation and training contracts. 42 Operating profit for the segment decreased by 2% in 2003 compared to 2002. PT&TS’ operating profit declined by $40 million due to a changing mix of program maturity and initial development activities on platform integration programs, as well as the impact of the decline in volume in transportation and security system activities. These decreases more than offset a $25 million increase in operating profit primarily attributable to higher volume on air defense programs at M&FC. The increase in backlog during 2004 over 2003 resulted from increased orders on development programs. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 6,357 $ 6,021 $ 5,287 Operating profit 489 403 279 Backlog at year-end 16,112 12,813 10,701 Net sales for Space Systems increased by 6% in 2004 compared to 2003, as increases in Satellites of $320 million and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) of $75 million more than offset a decrease in Launch Services. The increase in Satellites was due to increased volume on government satellite programs and one additional commercial satellite delivery in 2004. In S&DMS, the increase was primarily attributable to fleet ballistic missile programs. The lower volume in Launch Services was mainly due to a decline in the Titan launch vehicle program, which more than offset increases in both Atlas launches (six in 2004 compared to five in 2003) and Proton launches (four in 2004 compared to two in 2003). Net sales for Space Systems increased by 14% in 2003 compared to 2002. Sales increased by $570 million in Satellites and $140 million in S&DMS compared to 2002. The growth in Satellites was due to higher volume on government satellite programs. The growth in S&DMS was attributable to increases in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense activities. In Launch Services, increased Titan activities offset lower sales resulting from a decline in Proton deliveries (two in 2003 and four in 2002). There were five Atlas launches in both 2003 and 2002. Operating profit for the segment increased 21% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Launch Services’ operating profit increased $65 million. This increase was primarily due to U.S. Government support of the Atlas program and the benefit resulting from the first quarter termination of a launch vehicle contract by a commercial customer, offset by a decline in activities on the Titan launch vehicle program. Satellites’ operating profit increased $20 million due to commercial satellite deliveries, partially offset by lower profitability on a government satellite program. In 2003, government satellites operating profit reflected a $30 million charge related to a NASA satellite program. Operating profit for the segment increased 44% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Satellites’ operating profit increased by $70 million over the 2002 period mainly due to improved performance on commercial satellite activities and volume increases on government satellite programs, including the impact of a $30 million charge recorded in 2003 related to a NASA satellite program. In Launch Services, operating profit increased by $35 million. The increase was primarily due to improved performance and risk retirement activities on the maturing Titan program, which were partially offset by the impact of a decline in Proton launches in 2003. S&DMS’ operating profit increased by $20 million due to the impact of the volume increases discussed above. The increase in backlog during 2004 as compared to 2003 was mainly due to an increase in orders for government satellites, launch services and missile defense activities. Integrated Systems & Solutions Integrated Systems & Solutions’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 3,850 $ 3,420 $ 3,015 Operating profit 334 291 241 Backlog at year-end 4,586 4,350 3,556 Net sales for IS&S increased by 13% in 2004 as compared to 2003 and by 13% for 2003 over 2002. For both comparative periods, the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 15% in 2004 as compared to 2003 and by 21% for 2003 over 2002. The increases in operating profit for both comparative periods were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above. 43 Information & Technology Services Information & Technology Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 3,801 $ 3,174 $ 3,104 Operating profit 285 226 177 Backlog at year-end 4,560 4,817 4,617 Net sales for I&TS increased by 20% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of $510 million in Information Technology. Information Technology’s sales improved due to organic growth, as well as the net impact of our purchase of Affiliated Computer Services’ federal government IT business and the concurrent sale of our commercial IT business in November 2003. The remaining increase in sales of $120 million was primarily attributable to higher volume in Defense Services, which offset a decline in NASA sales. Net sales for I&TS increased by 2% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The sales increase for the year was mainly the result of volume increases of $110 million in Information Technology, which more than offset lower sales volume totaling $40 million on Defense Services and NASA programs. Information Technology’s results included the net impact of the previously mentioned transactions with Affiliated Computer Services in 2003. Operating profit for the segment increased by 26% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The operating profit increase was mainly due to Information Technology volume and program performance. Operating profit for the segment increased by 28% in 2003 as compared to 2002. The operating profit increase was mainly due to the higher volume in Information Technology and improved performance across all lines of business. The I&TS segment includes a business unit that provides services to the government of Argentina. At December 31, 2004, we had net investments in and advances to this unit totaling about $20 million. While we expect that these amounts will be recovered, there is always the potential that further devaluation of the Argentine peso, deterioration in the Argentine economy or other factors could adversely affect our ability to recover those amounts. 44 Net Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income The following table shows the components of net unallocated Corporate (expense) income. For a discussion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and other types of items included in net unallocated Corporate (expense) income, see Note 15 to the financial statements. For information about items not considered in segment operating performance, see the table under the previous discussion of results of operations. The decrease in “Other, net” was primarily due to lower earnings on our equity investments in 2004. (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (595 ) $ (300 ) $ 243 Items not considered in segment operating performance (215 ) (153 ) (1,112 ) Other, net (77 ) 4 7 $ (887 ) $ (449 ) $ (862 ) The difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS and pension expense determined in accordance with FAS 87 is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit (FAS/CAS pension adjustment). The CAS funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments’ cost of goods sold. A majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing, and is consequently included in the segments’ sales. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS (expense) income, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 FAS 87 (expense) income $ (884 ) $ (484 ) $ 156 Less: CAS expense and funding (289 ) (184 ) (87 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – (expense) income $ (595 ) $ (300 ) $ 243 As disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements, FAS 87 expense increased primarily due to higher recognized net actuarial losses and higher service cost in 2004, and due to a lower expected return on plan assets in addition to these other two factors in 2003. Liquidity and Cash Flows Our management has set forth strategic cash deployment objectives to help ensure that we keep a focus toward growing our core business and increasing shareholder value, and that we are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to do so when they arise. Those objectives include internal investment in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), share repurchases, increases in dividends, debt reductions, and selected acquisitions of businesses consistent with our strategy. The following discussion highlights our cash activities over the past three years as well as our future plans. Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities (In millions) 45 Operating Activities Cash from operations continues to be the primary source of funds for financing our activities. Cash from operations amounted to $2.9 billion in 2004, $1.8 billion in 2003 and $2.3 billion in 2002. Our earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, were the driving force behind these cash flows. Our working capital has continued to be a focus of our cash management processes, particularly with our sales having increased by $11.5 billion over the last three years. We attribute this performance to our continued discipline in managing our cash conversion cycle, including the negotiation of performance-based progress payment or advance payment terms in our contracts, inventory management, and billing and collection activities. We continue to leverage the billing and collection processes of our Shared Services centers, including the emphasis on electronic interfaces with our U. S. Government customers. Cash from operations is net of internal investments we have made in our business relative to independent research and development and bid and proposal activities aggregating $962 million in 2004, $903 million in 2003 and $830 million in 2002. During 2004 and 2003, we made discretionary prepayments of $485 million and $450 million, respectively, to pre-fund our pension plan trusts that reduced cash from operations. Such payments were made to reduce our cash funding requirements in the subsequent year. Our 2002 cash from operations included $117 million from the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim. We expect our cash from operations to continue to be strong over the next two years. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $769 million in 2004, $687 million in 2003 and $662 million in 2002. We expect our capital expenditures to increase over the next two years consistent with the expected growth in our business. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – In addition to our internal investment in capital expenditures and independent research and development activities, we also selectively identify businesses for potential acquisition. During 2004, we paid $91 million for businesses to strengthen our capabilities in providing services to defense and other government customers. During 2003, we paid approximately $645 million for two businesses to strengthen our capabilities in providing IT services to defense, intelligence and other government customers. We also paid $130 million in 2003 related to our guarantee of Space Imaging, LLC’s borrowings under its credit facility. During the past three years, we have divested non-core businesses, primarily those serving commercial markets. We received cash of approximately $90 million in 2004 from the sale of our COMSAT General business, $110 million in 2003 from the sale of our commercial IT business and $134 million in 2002 from the sale of certain discontinued telecommunication businesses. During 2004, New Skies Satellites, N.V. was sold to a private equity firm. Our portion of the proceeds was $148 million, $140 million of which was received in 2004. In December 2003, Inmarsat Ventures, Ltd., a venture in which we held a 14% interest, was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction. In exchange for our interest, we received cash of $114 million and a 14% ownership interest in the new Inmarsat holding company, Inmarsat Group Holdings, Ltd., valued at $96 million. During 2004, Inmarsat Group Holdings refinanced its debt, and we received cash of $50 million, reducing our investment to $46 million while retaining our 14% ownership interest. In January 2005, the sale of Intelsat, Ltd. to a private equity firm was completed for $18.75 per share. We received proceeds of about $750 million for our 25% ownership of Intelsat. Financing Activities Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long-term debt. In 2004, we used $1.1 billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long-term debt. We used $163 million of cash for costs associated with the early retirement of $951 million of debt through our tender offers. In 2003, we issued $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior debentures that bear interest at three-month LIBOR less 25 basis points, reset quarterly. We used the proceeds of that issuance, along with cash from operations, to repay $2.2 billion of debt in advance of its maturity and retire other high cost debt. We used $175 million of cash for debt issuance and repayment costs to complete those transactions. Share repurchases and dividends – We also used cash in each of the last three years for the repurchase of shares of our common stock: $772 million for 14.7 million common shares in 2004, of which $673 million for 12.9 million common shares was settled during the year, $482 million in 2003 for 10.7 million common shares and $50 million in 2002 for 1.0 million common shares. These transactions were pursuant to our share repurchase program initiated in 2002. A total of 16.6 million common shares may be repurchased in the future under the program. 46 The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $405 million in 2004, $261 million in 2003 and $199 million in 2002. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last two years. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2004 and $0.25 per share for the last quarter of 2004. In 2003, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.12 per share during each of the first three quarters of the year and $0.22 for the last quarter of 2003. We plan to continue to deploy a majority of the cash we generate from operations (after capital expenditures) to repurchase shares and pay dividends. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2004, our total long-term debt amounted to $5.1 billion. Our long-term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures. Our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for $1.0 billion of convertible debentures issued in 2003 with a floating interest rate based on LIBOR (discussed in more detail below). Through our repayment activities, our long-term debt has declined from a balance of $9.9 billion at December 31, 2000. We improved our debt-to-total capital ratio from 58% at December 31, 2000 to 42% at December 31, 2004. Debt-To-Total Capital Ratio (In percent) Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $7.0 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of $265 million from December 31, 2003. The increase resulted from net earnings and stock plan activities partially offset by our payment of dividends, an increase in our minimum pension liability and share repurchase activity. Return on invested capital (ROIC) improved by 120 basis points during 2004 to 11.9%. We define ROIC as net income plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt). We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. We use ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also plan to use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes in 2005. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Consolidated Financial Data - Five Year Summary on page 26 for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. In 2004, we repaid a total of $1.1 billion of long-term debt, including scheduled and early debt repayments. Through the completion of tender offers, we repaid debt totaling $951 million: $285 million (73%) of our outstanding 7.70% Notes due June 15, 2008 and $666 million (67%) of our outstanding 8.20% Notes due December 1, 2009. In connection with these early repayments, we recorded charges in 2004, net of state income tax benefits, totaling $154 million. The charges reduced net earnings by $100 million ($0.22 per share). At December 31, 2004, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2009, and a $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2005. There were no borrowings outstanding under either facility at December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a defined bank Base Rate. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2004. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources, are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs, projected over the next three years. 47 Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle other long-term liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these long-term obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less than 1year 1–3 years 3–5 years After 5years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,119 $ 15 $ 269 $ 432 $ 4,403 Operating lease commitments 1,066 251 333 201 281 Purchase obligations 1,541 866 564 111 — Other long-term liabilities 1,183 197 271 128 587 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,909 $ 1,329 $ 1,437 $ 872 $ 5,271 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Purchase obligations include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to sub-contractors, outsourcing arrangements, and non-cancelable commitments for property, plant and equipment. Generally, amounts for purchase obligations in the preceding table exclude contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. These commitments are excluded because the U.S. Government would be required to pay us for any costs we incur if they terminate our contracts with them “for convenience” pursuant to FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform sub-contract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. If so, amounts related to purchase obligations entered into in support of those contracts were excluded from the preceding table. To the extent contracts with customers do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers, related purchase obligation amounts are included in the table. Amounts related to “Other long-term liabilities” in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2004. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans and environmental liabilities. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party under an agreement entered into in 2000. 48 We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, as follows: Commitment Expiration per Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less than 1year 1–3 years 3–5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit (a) $ 2,713 $ 2,385 $ 310 $ 7 $ 11 Surety bonds (a) 328 189 139 — — Guarantees 4 4 — — — Total commitments $ 3,045 $ 2,578 $ 449 $ 7 $ 11 (a) Approximately $2,245 million and $115 million of standby letters of credit in the “less than 1 year” and “1–3 year” periods, respectively, and approximately $64 million of surety bonds in the “less than 1 year” period, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $420 million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded in the balance sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $2 billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. 49 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating rate long-term debt. The estimated fair values of the Corporation’s long-term debt instruments at December 31, 2004, aggregated approximately $6.3 billion, compared with a carrying amount of approximately $5.1 billion. The majority of our long-term debt obligations are not callable until maturity. We sometimes use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates; however, at year-end 2004, we had no such agreements in place. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies, or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time as the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized currently. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended, were not material. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payments, that, upon implementation, will impact our net earnings and earnings per share, and change the classification of certain elements of the statement of cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires stock options and other share-based payments made to employees to be accounted for as compensation expense and recorded at fair value, and to reflect the related tax benefit received upon exercise of the options in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity inflow rather than an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented. Consistent with the provisions of the new standard, we intend to adopt FAS 123(R) in the third quarter of 2005, and to implement it on a prospective basis. Information about the fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model and its pro forma impact on our net earnings and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 can be found in Note 1 to the financial statements, and we expect the impact of implementing the new standard using this model will be a reduction in earnings per share of approximately $0.10 to $0.20 on a full year basis. However, a number of technical implementation issues are yet to be resolved, including the selection and use of an appropriate valuation model, and the ultimate impact of adopting FAS 123(R) is not yet known. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This FSP provides specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy to eligible sponsors of retiree health care benefits provided under this law. Using this guidance, the Corporation calculated a reduction in its accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2004 of $295 million from the effects of the new law and, after application of government contracting regulations, doesn’t anticipate a material impact on net earnings from the reduction in net periodic post-retirement benefits cost in 2005. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost to benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2004. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. 50 During 2004, we devoted significant effort to comply with the rules on internal control over financial reporting issued pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This effort expanded upon our long-standing practice of acknowledging management’s responsibility for the establishment and effective operation of internal control through performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on this work and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, were effective as of December 31, 2004. Management’s report on financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 51. In addition, both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent auditors. Their unqualified report appears on page 52. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Annual Report includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, notes to those financial statements and a five-year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our company and focus your review by directing you to some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year. Lockheed Martin’s Business Lockheed Martin Corporation principally researches, designs, develops, manufactures, integrates, operates and sustains advanced technology systems, products and services. We mainly serve customers in domestic and international defense, civil agencies, and homeland security. Our sales to agencies of the U.S. Government represented 85% of our sales in 2005. Of the remaining 15% of sales, approximately 13% related to sales to international customers, with the remainder attributable to commercial customers. In 2004 and 2003, sales to agencies of the U.S. Government represented 80% and 78% of our total sales, respectively. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence/homeland security, and government information technology. We operate in five principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). As a lead systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems, including integrated net-centric solutions, to missiles, aircraft, spacecraft and launch services. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 42 through 74) – provides management’s view about industry trends, risks and uncertainties relating to Lockheed Martin, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations, including discussions about the key performance drivers of each of our business segments, our financial position and cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events or transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 76 through 79) – include the following: • A report from management, indicating our responsibility for financial reporting, the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting and an assessment of the effectiveness of those controls; 42 Table of Contents • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, including their opinions on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, including their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. Financial statements (pages 80 through 83) – include our consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the last three years, and our balance sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Notes to the financial statements (pages 84 through 123) – provide insight into and are an integral part of our financial statements. The notes contain explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain of the captions on the financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies, and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Highlights The financial section of our Annual Report describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities, and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of the consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Postretirement benefit plans Environmental matters Discussion of business segments Page 49 and page 87 Page 52 and page 106 Page 54, page 86 and page 115 Page 58 and page 116 Liquidity and cash flows Page 66 and page 82 Capital structure and resources Page 68, page 81, page 83 and page 102 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 70 and page 113 Stock-based compensation Page 72, page 89 and page 103 Industry Considerations Department of Defense Business Customer requirements for defense and related advanced technology systems for 2006 and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war. The war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our 43 Table of Contents homeland and better communication and interoperability between law enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military services. At the same time, our nation’s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more joint-capabilities-based structure, which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility, stronger space capabilities, enhanced missile defense and improved information systems capabilities and security. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) recently completed the Congressionally mandated 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The QDR continues and accelerates the DoD’s prior commitment to a transformation of the military to focus more on the needs of its combatant commanders and to develop portfolios of joint capabilities rather than stove-piped programs. This movement towards horizontally-integrated structures is expected to become an organizing principle for the DoD in making investment decisions for future systems. We formed the Integrated Systems & Solutions business segment in 2003 to help us better focus our integrated solutions capabilities across the Corporation and enhance our ability to serve as a lead partner with the DoD. In 2005, we opened our Center for Innovation, a state-of-the-art facility for modeling and simulating our net-centric solutions for our customers. The President’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2007 and beyond presents a framework to reduce the federal budget deficit while prosecuting the global war on terrorism. The DoD budget is growing, but at lower levels than in the past few years, in order to continue the modernization and recapitalization that began earlier this decade. The budget for the Department of Homeland Security is increasing, while spending across other non-defense federal agencies is anticipated to decline through 2011. These changes in the President’s budget plan reflect a commitment to a 50% reduction in the federal budget deficit by 2009, and the sentiment expressed by the Federal Reserve that sustained federal deficits could hamper economic growth. The President’s budget proposal includes $439 billion for the DoD, including $84 billion for procurement of systems and $73 billion for research and development. Transformation of the DoD enterprise and accompanying budget pressures also may create additional opportunities for supply chain logistics, business process management and outsourcing of service functions by the military services, expanding the scope of private sector contracting opportunities at the DoD. The Fiscal Year 2007-2011 Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) projects sustained growth in the DoD’s top line budget, rising from $439 billion in 2007 to $502 billion in 2011. These estimates do not include any allowance to fund ongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism, which are expected to be addressed through annual supplemental appropriations as required. The DoD’s continued emphasis on systems modernization is reflected in the proposed growth in the FYDP for Procurement, which is estimated to increase from $84 billion in 2007 to $118 billion in 2011. Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&E) spending will remain roughly the same during this period, ranging from $73 billion in 2007 to $75 billion in 2009, declining then to $71 billion in 2011. While subject to change in future specific budget submissions and annual appropriation by Congress, these estimates continue the Administration’s long stated intent to modernize the Armed Forces while prosecuting the war on terrorism. The differing trends in Procurement and RDT&E budgets reflect the maturation of programs emerging from RDT&E funding into procurement, such as the F-35 program. 44 Table of Contents In the past two years, Congress provided for supplemental appropriations to defray costs for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Approximately $50 billion has already been provided relative to 2006 and another $70 billion has been requested. These supplemental appropriations have enabled the DoD to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs, versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. While there is no assurance that additional supplemental appropriations will be approved by Congress, we do not believe that sustained operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will materially impact the procurement and research and development budget in the near term. We believe that our broad mix of programs and capabilities positions us favorably to support the future needs of the various agencies of the U.S. Government in defense and information technology. Our major programs and capabilities include: missile defense; space intelligence; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); air mobility aircraft; and air-power projection/precision-strike capability. In terms of size and long-term potential impact, two of our more significant programs are the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force approved the F-22 for full rate production, declared initial operational capability and rated the F-22 “mission capable” based on successful completion of operational testing. The DoD plans to continue production of the F-22 through 2011 to coincide with the anticipated production of the F-35 to avoid a gap in 5TH Generation fighter stealth and advanced avionics capabilities. While the ultimate number of F-35s to be produced will continue to be subject to debate, the QDR and budget indicate support for the program. We are also represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the AEGIS Weapon System program, the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle program. In the areas of space intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, and the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H), and in classified programs and battle management command and control capabilities. In airlift, we have the C-130J program and are under contract to upgrade the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. Many of the aforementioned programs require funding over several budget cycles. There is always an inherent risk that these and other large, highly visible programs which are subject to annual appropriation by Congress could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs. We continually explore opportunities to expand into adjacent product lines utilizing our existing advanced technology products and services, and have been successful in doing so through such programs as the Littoral Combat Ship and Marine One U.S. Presidential Helicopter programs. We also are continuing to pursue opportunities to expand our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers. In addition, we have focused our efforts on select acquisitions, cost savings and improving efficiency. Through these activities, we have been able to pass along savings to our customers, mainly the U.S. Government. 45 Table of Contents Non-Department of Defense Business We provide products and services to a number of government agencies other than the DoD, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Library of Congress. Although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets, they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, as well as other risks unique to the particular programs. For example, although indemnification by the U.S. Government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We do plan to seek, and in certain cases have obtained, limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the “SAFETY Act” provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In the event we were to provide homeland security-related products and services to a customer without such qualification, we would not be afforded the benefit of the SAFETY Act’s cap on tort liability or U.S. Government indemnification. In addition, our information technology products and services related to Homeland Security may raise potential liabilities associated with privacy issues for which neither indemnification nor SAFETY Act coverage is available. Other risks unique to civil government programs may include development of competing products, technological feasibility and product obsolescence. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and E-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the EPA, as well for the DoD. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance and enterprise solutions. Consistent with the President’s agenda, the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public/private competitions. Such a competition led to the selection in 2005 of Lockheed Martin to operate the Federal Aviation Administration’s Automated Flight Services Station Network. In addition, recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. In addition, the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports and waterways security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, information systems security and other global security systems solutions. We provide products and services to NASA, including the Space Shuttle program, mainly through our Space Systems and Information & Technology Services business segments. We also have a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC which provides ground processing and 46 Table of Contents other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. We expect to compete for NASA programs related to the next generation manned space exploration program. Non-U.S. defense budgets have generally been flat or declining over the past decade. As a result, consolidation has been occurring in the European aerospace industry, resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors. Space Business Sales of commercial launch vehicles and satellites continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. The reduction in demand has resulted in pricing pressures for both launch vehicles and satellites. Despite this environment, we did receive new orders for commercial satellites and launch vehicles in both 2004 and 2005. For a discussion of the results of operations of our Space Systems segment, see the “Discussion of Business Segments” section. The above factors have impacted orders for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV or Atlas V), our next generation launch vehicle program in which we have made significant investments over the past few years. The Atlas V is available for both commercial and U.S. Government use. This program has required investment of funds for research and development, start-up and other nonrecurring costs, and launch facilities. Some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the U.S. Government. We have received a total of 19 launch assignments from the U.S. Government, nine of which are under contract and in backlog. The 19 launch assignments include seven that were reassigned in 2003 from the original EELV competition (referred to as “Buy 1”) as a result of our competitor’s violation of the Procurement Integrity Act. Two of the seven launch reassignments were for West Coast launches and, since then, the Air Force has assigned us four additional West Coast launches. To prepare for these, we upgraded our West Coast launch facilities, which required further investment in the EELV program (see Note 5 to the financial statements). We expect to recover the investment through the pricing of the West Coast launches. The U.S. Government has been awarding launch missions incrementally as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy for future national missions. The U.S. Government plans to maintain assured access to space to the maximum extent possible and has recognized the need to fund additional EELV infrastructure costs created by the weaker-than-originally-anticipated commercial demand for launch services. We had three Atlas launches in 2005, including our fifth Atlas V commercial launch. As of year-end 2005, the Atlas family of launch vehicles had a record of 77 consecutive successful launches. Commercial orders and prices for the Atlas V launch vehicle to date have been lower than we originally expected during the development phase of the vehicle. In 2005, we entered into an agreement with Boeing to create a joint venture that would combine the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of our Atlas launch vehicles and Boeing’s Delta launch vehicles. The joint venture, named United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA), is structured as a 50-50 joint venture and would be accounted for as an equity investment. Under the terms of the joint venture, Atlas and Delta expendable launch vehicles would continue to be available as alternatives on 47 Table of Contents individual launch missions. The agreement also stipulates that, upon closing of the transaction, Lockheed Martin and Boeing will dismiss all claims against each other in the pending civil litigation related to a previous competition for launches under the Air Force EELV program (see Note 15 for a discussion of that litigation). The closing of the ULA transaction is subject to conditions to closing, including government and regulatory approvals and agreements in the United States and internationally. On August 9, 2005, the European Commission determined that ULA was compatible with European Union merger control regulation. On October 24, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requested additional information from Lockheed Martin and Boeing related to ULA in response to the pre-merger notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR) submitted by the parties. The FTC’s “second request” extends the period that the FTC is permitted to review the transaction under the HSR Act. We currently plan to close the ULA transaction as soon as practicable following satisfaction of all the closing conditions. We do not expect that its formation will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position for 2006. If the conditions to closing are not satisfied and the ULA transaction is not consummated by March 31, 2006, either Boeing or Lockheed Martin may terminate the joint venture agreement. Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International, Inc. (LKEI), a joint venture we have with two Russian government-owned space firms, has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets from a launch site in Kazakhstan. One of the joint venture partners, Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev), is the manufacturer of the Proton launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in Russia. Commercial Atlas and Proton launch services are marketed around the world through International Launch Services (ILS), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and LKEI. We consolidate the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest. We received four new awards for launches on Proton vehicles in 2005. Contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer prior to launch. At the end of 2005, $315 million of advances received from customers for Proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability in our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. A sizeable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for Proton launch services are sent to Khrunichev. If a contracted launch service is not provided, a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to our customer. At year-end 2005, payments to Khrunichev included in inventories for launches under contract totaled $190 million. Our ability to recover these advances may be affected by Khrunichev’s ability to provide the launch services, as well as economic conditions and the political environment in Russia. Through the end of 2005, launch services through LKEI and ILS have been provided according to contract terms. The Corporation has entered into an agreement with RD AMROSS, a joint venture of the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation and the Russian firm NPO Energomash, for the purchase, subject to certain conditions, of RD-180 booster engines for use in the Corporation’s Atlas launch vehicles. Terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to RD AMROSS upon the achievement of certain milestones in the manufacturing process. Payments of $70 million made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the Corporation’s inventories at December 31, 2005. 48 Table of Contents As discussed above, commercial satellite sales have continued to experience pricing pressures due to excess capacity. However, in the past two years, we have received six commercial satellite orders and are in active discussions for additional satellite orders. In addition to commercial activity, we also received new orders for government satellites in 2004 and 2005, including those under the MUOS program and certain classified activities. Other Business Considerations As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. We have entered into various joint venture, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business. Some of these business arrangements include foreign partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition A large part of our business is derived from long-term contracts for design, development and production activities which we account for consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) audit and accounting guide, Audits of Federal Government 49 Table of Contents Contractors, and the AICPA’s Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. We also enter into contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development or production activities. We account for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract. Accounting for Design, Development and Production Contracts Generally, we record long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program, Atlas and Proton launch vehicle programs, and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price development and production contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F-22 Raptor program and the AEGIS Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low level of initial production units in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter system development and demonstration (SDD) program and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Incentives and award fees related to performance on design, development and production contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not 50 Table of Contents recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Assumptions have to be made regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. Products and services provided under long-term design, development and production contracts make up the majority of our business. Therefore, the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit at completion for all design, development and production contracts was higher or lower by 1%, our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately $190 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period. Accounting for Other Services Contracts Revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design, development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when earned, depending on the contract. This methodology is mainly used by our Information & Technology Services segment. Services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred, except that initial “set-up” costs are capitalized and recognized over the life of the agreement. Operating profit related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date of award. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of 51 Table of Contents costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans), and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. Effective January 1, 2006, new non-union represented employees that we hire are not being covered by defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in defined contribution plans. We currently plan to offer those employees the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but will not subsidize the cost of their participation effective January 1, 2006. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions. Those rules require that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and, in the case of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, past investment experience, judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. An example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in 2005. We reassess our pension plan assumptions each year. Based on our review of 52 Table of Contents interest rates at the end of the year, we lowered our discount rate assumption to 5.625% at December 31, 2005, compared to 5.75% used at the end of 2004. Before the end of 2005, we also performed a study of the rates of increase in future compensation levels. The results of that study indicated that it would be appropriate to reduce that rate from 5.50% to 5.0% at the end of 2005. These changes, together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years, resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for 2006 will decrease by approximately 15% to 20% as compared to 2005 expense. The primary drivers of this projected decrease were the change in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets over the past year, including contributions we made to the pension trust. The decrease of 50 basis points in the compensation rate decreased the estimated 2006 expense by approximately $100 million. In addition, the higher asset base at the beginning of 2006 drove a higher expected return on assets for 2006, which was the main component of the remaining decrease in the expense. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $50 million in the estimated 2006 pension expense, resulting from the 12.5 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption. The annual review of our pension plan assumptions also affects the pension liability recorded in our balance sheet. At the end of each of the last few years, we have recorded noncash after-tax adjustments in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for many of our pension plans. These adjustments were calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and were determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for each plan to the fair value of that plan’s assets. The amount by which the ABO exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan, must be recorded as a minimum pension liability, with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset, if appropriate, and a reduction to stockholders’ equity. In 2005, the minimum pension liability adjustment we recorded reduced stockholders’ equity by $105 million primarily due to minimum pension liabilities associated with nonqualified benefit plans and the changes in assumptions. At the end of 2004, the adjustment reduced stockholders’ equity by $285 million, mainly driven by the change in the discount rate. These adjustments did not impact earnings. The accumulated minimum pension liability balances in stockholders’ equity at the end of 2005 and 2004 were $(1,629) million and $(1,524) million, respectively. The amount of the minimum pension liability is computed at each year-end and could decrease or increase depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore are recognized in our net sales. The total funding requirement for pension plans under CAS in 2005 was $498 million. For 2006, we expect our funding requirements under CAS to increase. Also in 2006, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code rules. Any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2005 and 2004, we made discretionary prepayments of $980 million and $485 million, respectively, to the pension trust. Prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required. Accordingly, although our CAS funding requirements are expected to increase over the $498 million required in 2005, we expect our cash contributions to the pension plans to be $100 million to $110 million, primarily reflecting the additional funding required under Internal Revenue Code rules. 53 Table of Contents The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Since the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. See the discussion of “Net Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income” under “Discussion of Business Segments.” In response to the public’s concern over the adequacy of pension plan funding, Congress has been drafting legislation to address the amount of annual contributions that companies are required to pay into their pension funds. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have passed their own versions of a pension funding bill and those bills are expected to go to conference during the latter part of the first quarter of 2006. It is expected that the conference process will produce compromises and changes in the Senate and House bills, and ultimate passage of a bill is uncertain. This uncertainty makes it difficult to quantify the potential impact to our pension funding. Generally, the Senate and House bills, as drafted, would accelerate the required amount of our annual pension plan contributions, which may have a material impact on our cash flows for a few years beginning in 2007. Absent other changes, the subsequent annual funding requirements would be expected to decline in recognition of the accelerated contributions. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to, along with other factors, difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, cost allowability issues and agreements between PRPs to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise, we project costs over an appropriate time frame not to exceed 20 years. 54 Table of Contents Given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the end of 2005, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was $464 million. About 60% of the liability relates to sites in Redlands, Burbank and Glendale, California, and in Great Neck, New York, mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The remainder of the liability relates to other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated. We have recorded assets totaling $353 million at December 31, 2005 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for U.S. Government businesses. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales. Any recoveries we receive from other PRPs or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government sales and cost of sales. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this not only internally, through our independent research and development activities, but also through acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow expansion into adjacent product lines or access to new technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses during the past several years. Over the last five years, we have completed 10 such acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Conversely, we may also explore the sale of businesses, investments and surplus real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. 55 Table of Contents Acquisitions In 2005, we completed the purchase of The SYTEX Group, Inc. (SYTEX). The total purchase price, including transaction-related costs, was approximately $480 million. Approximately $380 million of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing, with most of the remainder payable in 2006. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Purchase accounting adjustments were recorded by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, and included recording goodwill of $395 million, of which $360 million will be amortized for tax purposes. The acquisition expands the Corporation’s information technology solutions and technical support services businesses with the DoD and other federal agencies. The operations of SYTEX are included in the Information & Technology Services business segment. In 2005, we also completed the acquisitions of STASYS Limited, a U.K.-based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability; INSYS Group Limited, a U.K.-based diversified supplier of military communications systems, weapons systems and advanced analysis services; and Coherent Technologies, Inc., a U.S.-based supplier of high-performance, laser-based remote sensing systems. The aggregate cash purchase price for these three acquisitions was $180 million. Purchase accounting adjustments included recording combined goodwill of $164 million. These acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for 2005. In January 2006, we acquired Aspen Systems Corporation, a U.S.-based company that provides a range of business process and technology solutions primarily to civil agencies of the U.S. Government. This acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Divestitures During 2005 and 2004, we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments, as follows: In January 2005, we completed the sale of our 25% interest in Intelsat, Ltd. to a private equity firm for $18.75 per share, or $752 million in total proceeds. The transaction resulted in the recording of a gain, net of state income taxes, of $47 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $31 million ($0.07 per share). In June 2005, Inmarsat plc (Inmarsat), a company in which we held a 14% interest, completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 150 million of its ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange. The IPO had the effect of diluting our ownership to 8.9% and was the primary driver for our recognition of a $42 million deferred gain that was recorded in 2003 related to this investment. In October 2005, we sold approximately 16 million of our Inmarsat shares for $89 million, further reducing our ownership percentage to 5.3%. These transactions resulted in the recording of gains, net of state income taxes, totaling $126 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $82 million ($0.18 per share). At December 31, 2005, we held 24 million shares of Inmarsat with a total market value of $146 million. In January 2006, we sold an additional 12 million shares of Inmarsat for $75 million. The gain is expected to increase 2006 net earnings by $47 million ($0.11 per share). 56 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our interest in NeuStar, Inc. The transaction resulted in the recording of a gain, net of state income taxes, of $30 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $19 million ($0.04 per share). In November 2004, a private equity firm purchased the outstanding shares of New Skies Satellites, N.V. (New Skies). We sold our shares for $148 million. The transaction resulted in the recording of a gain, net of state income taxes, of $91 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $59 million ($0.13 per share). The carrying value of our investment in New Skies was marked to market through other comprehensive income prior to the sale. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” which follows, describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated sales and operating profit for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our businesses and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business, versus distinguishing between products and services. As mentioned previously, most of our services revenues are generated in our Information & Technology Services segment. For 2005, net sales were $37.2 billion, a 5% increase over 2004 sales. Sales for 2004 were $35.5 billion, an increase of 12% compared to 2003. Sales, as compared to the prior year, increased in all segments except Aeronautics in 2005, where there was a slight decline due to an anticipated reduction in combat aircraft deliveries. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 85% of our sales for 2005, compared to 80% in 2004 and 78% in 2003. Other income and expense, net was $449 million for 2005 compared to $121 million in 2004. This was due to an increase in investment income, gains from the sale of investments (primarily Intelsat and Inmarsat) and charges in 2004 for the early retirement of debt. Other income and expenses, net increased $78 million from 2003 to 2004 due to gains from the sale of the COMSAT General business and the investment in New Skies. 57 Table of Contents Our operating profit for 2005 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 43% compared to 2004. Our operating profit for 2004 was $2.1 billion, an increase of 3% compared to 2003. Interest expense for 2005 was $370 million, $55 million lower than in 2004. Interest expense for 2004 was $425 million, $62 million lower than the amount for 2003. The decrease in interest expense was due to reductions in our debt outstanding. Our effective tax rates were 30.2% for 2005, 23.9% for 2004, and 31.3% for 2003. For each of the three years, our tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate by the tax benefits related to export sales and tax deductible dividends. For 2005, our tax rate was reduced by the new tax deduction for sales of products manufactured in the U.S. For 2004, our tax rate reflected a $144 million reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. Net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the fourth straight year. We reported net earnings of $1.8 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2005, compared to net earnings of $1.3 billion ($2.83 per share) in 2004 and earnings of $1.1 billion ($2.34 per share) in 2003. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). In the Aeronautics business segment, sales have leveled compared to the growth that had been experienced the last few years. This is largely due to lower sales on Combat Aircraft programs driven by declines in F-16 volume, completion of initial ramp-up activities associated with F-35 development and F-22 production, and the completion of the F-22 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program. The number of F-16 deliveries is expected to continue to decline over the next few years; however, with the Greek Government’s contract authorization for 30 aircraft, firm production is currently planned through 2009. During 2005, 23 F-22s were delivered and the program achieved initial operational capability, indicating its readiness for service. The Lot 5 contract for the production of 24 aircraft is expected to continue production of the F-22 into 2008, and we received advanced procurement contracts for production of Lots 6 and 7 associated with long lead activities. The initial F-35 test aircraft is being readied for its first flight and significant progress is being made on the carrier-based and short takeoff variants as well. Activity on the C-130J program included 15 aircraft deliveries in 2005. Through 2005, we have delivered 16 of the 60 aircraft under the multi-year award, and production and delivery of the remaining multi-year aircraft are expected to continue into 2009. The Electronic Systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services. Many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. This business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator, as demonstrated with its role as the prime contractor on the Presidential Helicopter and Littoral Combat Ship programs. The Space Systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions, primarily to our U.S. Government customers. Growth will depend on our government satellite business and our ability to capture market share. The commercial satellite and launch vehicle industries continue 58 Table of Contents to be very competitive, with resulting pricing pressures. During 2005, the final Titan IV was launched and we now plan to continue to provide launch services to our U.S. Government customers with our Atlas V vehicle through the EELV program. The IS&S and I&TS business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense, intelligence and other government customers. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies. In the following table of financial data, total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. The reconciling item “Net unallocated Corporate expense” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see discussion below), earnings and losses from equity investments, interest income, costs for certain stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with FAS 87, and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with U.S. Government CAS, which are reflected in the business segment results. CAS is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements, and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in segment net sales. The results of operations of the segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 11,672 $ 11,785 $ 10,206 Electronic Systems 10,580 9,729 8,996 Space Systems 6,820 6,359 6,024 Integrated Systems & Solutions 4,131 3,851 3,422 Information & Technology Services 4,010 3,802 3,176 $ 37,213 $ 35,526 $ 31,824 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 994 $ 899 $ 690 Electronic Systems 1,113 969 858 Space Systems 609 489 403 Integrated Systems & Solutions 365 334 291 Information & Technology Services 351 285 226 Total business segments 3,432 2,976 2,468 Net unallocated Corporate expense (446 ) (887 ) (449 ) $ 2,986 $ 2,089 $ 2,019 59 Table of Contents The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $75 billion and $74 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This amount included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $35 billion at December 31, 2005. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 16 to the financial statements. Segment Operating Profit (In millions) Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 11,672 $ 11,785 $ 10,206 Operating profit 994 899 690 Backlog at year-end 29,580 30,489 37,580 Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by $113 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was mainly due to anticipated declines in Combat Aircraft, which were partially offset by growth in Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft sales decreased by $480 million for the year primarily due to declines in F-16 volume, which more than offset higher F-35 and F-22 volume. The sales growth in Air Mobility was due to additional C-130J deliveries (15 in 2005 compared to 13 in 2004) and higher volume on other Air Mobility programs. Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. The majority of the increase in sales, $1.5 billion, was due to higher volume on the F-35, F-16 and F-22 Combat Aircraft programs. In 2004, 83 F-16s were delivered, 21 more than in 2003. The remaining 60 Table of Contents increase in sales was mainly due to higher C-5 activities in Air Mobility. There were 13 C-130J deliveries in 2004 compared to 15 deliveries in 2003. Operating profit for the segment increased by 11% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher Air Mobility operating profit that exceeded a decline in Combat Aircraft operating profit. Air Mobility operating profit increased $100 million mainly due to improved performance and increased deliveries on the C-130J program. Combat Aircraft operating profit declined due to decreased F-16 deliveries (69 in 2005 compared to 83 in 2004) and reduced earnings on the F-35 development program, which more than offset increased volume and improved performance on the F-22 program. Operating profit for the segment increased by 30% in 2004 compared to 2003. Combat Aircraft operating profit increased $95 million primarily as a result of higher sales volume on the programs discussed above and improved performance on the F-22 program. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to $85 million in operating profit recognized on the C-130Js delivered in 2004. The Corporation began recognizing profits on C-130J deliveries in 2004 upon resolution of certain technical aircraft performance risks, manufacturing performance improvements and the achievement of stable production as a result of securing a multi-year contract in 2003. Backlog decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of sales volume on the F-35 and F-16 programs as well as deliveries of C-130J aircraft. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 10,580 $ 9,729 $ 8,996 Operating profit 1,113 969 858 Backlog at year-end 19,932 18,239 17,339 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Higher volume in tactical and surface systems programs contributed to increased sales of $495 million at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2). Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS) sales increased $310 million primarily due to platform integration activities. Air defense and fire control programs contributed to increased sales of $40 million at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 8% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in sales was due to higher volume in MS2 and M&FC. Higher volume on surface systems programs accounted for most of MS2’s sales growth of $450 million. M&FC’s sales increased $265 million, primarily due to higher volume on fire control and tactical missile programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 15% in 2005 compared to 2004. Operating profit increased by $80 million at M&FC mainly due to improved performance on fire control and air defense programs. Performance on surface systems programs contributed to an increase 61 Table of Contents in operating profit of $50 million at MS2. PT&TS operating profit increased $10 million primarily due to improved performance on simulation and training programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 13% in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating profit increased $145 million due to improved performance on tactical missile and fire control programs at M&FC and on radar programs at MS2. The decrease in operating profit at PT&TS was due to a $25 million loss provision recorded in the third quarter of 2004 on certain international simulation and training contracts. The increase in backlog during 2005 over 2004 resulted from increased orders on development programs. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 6,820 $ 6,359 $ 6,024 Operating profit 609 489 403 Backlog at year-end 15,925 16,112 12,813 Net sales for Space Systems increased by 7% in 2005 compared to 2004. During the year, sales growth in Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) offset declines in Launch Services. The $410 million increase in Satellites sales was due to higher volume on government satellite programs that more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities. There were no commercial satellite deliveries in 2005, compared to four in 2004. Increased sales of $235 million in S&DMS were attributable to the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. The $180 million decrease in Launch Services’ sales was mainly due to having three Atlas launches in 2005 compared to six in 2004. Net sales for Space Systems increased by 6% in 2004 compared to 2003, as increases in Satellites of $320 million and S&DMS of $75 million more than offset a $55 million decrease in Launch Services. The increase in Satellites was due to increased volume on government satellite programs and one additional commercial satellite delivery in 2004. In S&DMS, the increase was primarily attributable to fleet ballistic missile programs. The lower volume in Launch Services was mainly due to a decline in the Titan launch vehicle program, which more than offset increases in both Atlas launches (six in 2004 compared to five in 2003) and Proton launches (four in 2004 compared to two in 2003). Operating profit for the segment increased 25% in 2005 compared to 2004. Operating profit increased in Launch Services, S&DMS and Satellites. In Launch Services, the $60 million increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to improved performance on the Atlas vehicle program. Satellites’ operating profit increased $35 million due to the higher volume and improved performance on government satellite programs, which more than offset the decreased operating profit due to the decline in commercial satellite deliveries. The $20 million increase in S&DMS was attributable to higher volume on fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. 62 Table of Contents Operating profit for the segment increased 21% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Launch Services’ operating profit increased $65 million. This increase was primarily due to U.S. Government support of the Atlas program and the benefit resulting from the first quarter termination of a launch vehicle contract by a commercial customer, offset by a decline in activities on the Titan launch vehicle program. Satellites’ operating profit increased $20 million due to commercial satellite deliveries, partially offset by lower profitability on a government satellite program. In 2003, government satellites operating profit reflected a $30 million charge related to a NASA satellite program. The decrease in backlog during 2005 as compared to 2004 was mainly due to sales related to government satellite programs. Integrated Systems & Solutions Integrated Systems & Solutions’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 4,131 $ 3,851 $ 3,422 Operating profit 365 334 291 Backlog at year-end 3,974 4,586 4,350 Net sales for IS&S increased by 7% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and by 13% in 2004 as compared to 2003. For both comparative periods, the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 9% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and by 15% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increases in operating profit for both comparative periods were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above. The decrease in backlog during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to the U.S. Army’s termination for convenience of the Aerial Common Sensor contract. Information & Technology Services Information & Technology Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 4,010 $ 3,802 $ 3,176 Operating profit 351 285 226 Backlog at year-end 5,414 4,560 4,817 Net sales for I&TS increased by 5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volumes of $460 million in Information Technology and Defense Services, which more than offset a sales decline of $250 million in NASA programs. 63 Table of Contents Information Technology’s sales increase includes the impact of organic growth and the purchase of SYTEX in March 2005. Net sales for I&TS increased by 20% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of $510 million in Information Technology. Information Technology’s sales improved due to organic growth, as well as the net impact of our purchase of Affiliated Computer Services’ federal government IT business and the concurrent sale of our commercial IT business in November 2003. The remaining increase in sales of $120 million was primarily attributable to higher volume in Defense Services, which offset a decline in NASA sales. Operating profit for the segment increased by 23% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The operating profit increase was mainly due to higher volume and improved performance in Information Technology and Defense Services. Operating profit for the segment increased by 26% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The operating profit increase was mainly due to Information Technology volume and program performance. The increase in backlog was attributable to growth in our Information Technology line of business. Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net The following table shows the components of net unallocated Corporate (expense) income. (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (626 ) $ (595 ) $ (300 ) Items not considered in segment operating performance 173 (215 ) (153 ) Other, net 7 (77 ) 4 $ (446 ) $ (887 ) $ (449 ) The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS and pension expense determined in accordance with FAS 87. That difference is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit. The CAS funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments’ cost of goods sold. A majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing, and is consequently included in the segments’ sales. 64 Table of Contents The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS (expense) income, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 FAS 87 expense $ (1,124 ) $ (884 ) $ (484 ) Less: CAS expense and funding (498 ) (289 ) (184 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – expense $ (626 ) $ (595 ) $ (300 ) As disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements, FAS 87 expense increased primarily due to higher recognized net actuarial losses and higher service cost in 2005, and due to a lower expected return on plan assets in addition to these other two factors in 2004. Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach promulgated by FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. For example, gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by Corporate, as well as other Corporate activities such as charges recorded related to the early repayment of debt, are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following items were included in “Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net” for 2005, 2004 and 2003: (In millions, except per share data) OperatingProfit(Loss) Net Earnings(Loss) Earnings (Loss) Per Share Year ended December 31, 2005 Gains related to Inmarsat transactions $ 126 $ 82 $ 0.18 Gain on sale of interest in Intelsat 47 31 0.07 Gain on sale of interest in NeuStar 30 19 0.04 Impairment charge related to a satellite (30 ) (19 ) (0.04 ) $ 173 $ 113 $ 0.25 Year ended December 31, 2004 Charge for Pit 9 litigation $ (180 ) $ (117 ) $ (0.26 ) Charge for early retirement of debt (154 ) (100 ) (0.22 ) Gain on sale of interest in New Skies 91 59 0.13 Gain on sale of COMSAT General business 28 4 0.01 Benefit from closure of an IRS examination — 144 0.32 $ (215 ) $ (10 ) $ (0.02 ) Year ended December 31, 2003 Charge for early retirement of debt $ (146 ) $ (96 ) $ (0.21 ) Charge related to exit from the commercial mail sorting business (41 ) (27 ) (0.06 ) Gain on partial reversal of Space Imaging charge 19 13 0.03 Gain on sale of the commercial IT business 15 8 0.02 $ (153 ) $ (102 ) $ (0.22 ) 65 Table of Contents The increase in the “Other, net” component of unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net of $84 million from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest income due to a larger invested cash balance and higher interest rates in 2005. The decrease of $81 million from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to lower earnings on our equity investments in 2004. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance our businesses, increase shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), repurchased shares, increased our dividends, opportunistically reduced our debt and made select acquisitions of businesses. The following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities (In millions) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $270 million to $3.2 billion in 2005 as compared to 2004 after having increased by $1.1 billion to $2.9 billion in 2004 as compared to 2003. In 2005, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $559 million as compared to 2004, which more than offset a $386 million reduction in working capital improvements between the years. In 2004, the increase was attributable to an increase in net earnings of $213 million, and also to an increase in working capital improvements of $799 million compared to 2003. The remaining increase in cash between the periods was due to the timing of income tax payments and various other operating activities. The focus on improving our cash management processes continues to contribute to the aggregate reduction in operating working capital accounts (receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred), including an aggregate reduction of $106 million in 2005 as compared to a reduction of $492 million in 2004. Although we will continue to focus on management of operating working capital accounts, we do not expect the rate of improvements we have experienced in prior periods to continue. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $865 million in 2005, $769 million in 2004 and $687 million in 2003. We expect our capital expenditures to increase over the next two years consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements. 66 Table of Contents Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – We have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our financial targets and disciplined growth strategy. We have focused on government information technology providers, systems integrators and complementary technologies. We paid $564 million for four businesses in 2005, $91 million for two businesses in 2004 and $645 million for two businesses in 2003. During 2005, we received proceeds of $935 million from the divestiture of non-core equity investments. The proceeds included $752 million from the sale of our investment in Intelsat, Ltd., $140 million from the sale of Inmarsat shares and the redemption of certain Inmarsat equity-related investments, and $33 million from the sale of our NeuStar investment. During 2004, New Skies Satellites, N.V. was sold to a private equity firm. Our portion of the proceeds was $148 million, $140 million of which was received in 2004. Also during 2004, we received cash from Inmarsat Group Holdings, Ltd. amounting to $50 million which reduced the amount of our investment. In 2003, Inmarsat Ventures, Ltd. was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction. In exchange for our interest, we received cash of $114 million and retained an ownership interest in the new Inmarsat holding company, Inmarsat Group Holdings, Ltd., valued at $96 million. Also in 2003, we paid $130 million related to our guarantee of Space Imaging, LLC’s borrowings under its credit facility. Financing Activities Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long-term debt. In 2005, we used $133 million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long-term debt. In 2004, we used $1.1 billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long-term debt. Of that amount, $951 million related to the early retirement of debt through tender offers for which we incurred $163 million of associated costs. In 2003, we issued $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior debentures that bear interest at three-month LIBOR less 25 basis points, reset quarterly. We used the proceeds of that issuance, along with cash from operations, to repay $2.2 billion of debt in advance of its maturity and retire other high cost debt. We used $175 million of cash for debt issuance and repayment costs to complete those transactions in 2003. Share repurchases and dividends –We also used cash in each of the last three years for common share repurchase activity as follows: $1,222 million for 19.7 million common shares in 2005, of which $1,211 million for 19.5 million of those common shares, as well as $99 million for 1.8 million common shares purchased in 2004, was settled during the year; $772 million for 14.7 million common shares in 2004, of which $673 million for 12.9 million common shares was settled during the year; and $482 million in 2003 for 10.7 million common shares. These purchases were made under a share repurchase program in place for the repurchase of up to 88 million shares of our common stock from time-to-time at management’s discretion, including 45 million shares that were authorized for repurchase under the program in September 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased a total of 46.1 million shares under the program, and there remained approximately 41.9 million shares that may be repurchased in the future. The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $462 million in 2005, $405 million in 2004 and $261 million in 2003. We have increased our quarterly 67 Table of Contents dividend rate in each of the last three years. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2005 and $0.30 per share for the last quarter of 2005. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2004 and $0.25 per share for the last quarter of 2004. In 2003, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.12 per share during each of the first three quarters of the year and $0.22 per share for the last quarter of 2003. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2005 our total long-term debt amounted to $5.0 billion. Our long-term debt is almost entirely in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures. The majority of our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates; however, $1.0 billion of convertible debentures issued in 2003 have a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. In 2005, we repaid $133 million of long-term debt, including scheduled and early debt repayments. Through our repayment activities, our long-term debt balance has declined over the last five years from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2000. We improved our debt-to-total capitalization ratio from 58% at December 31, 2000 to 39% at December 31, 2005. Debt-To-Total Capital Ratio Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of $846 million from December 31, 2004. The increase came from net earnings and stock plan activities partially offset by our share repurchases and payment of dividends. Return on invested capital (ROIC) improved by 370 basis points during 2005 to 14.5%. We define ROIC as net income plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholder’s equity by adding back our minimum pension liability balance. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. We use ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. The adjustment to add back the minimum pension liability is a revision to our calculation in 2005 which we believe more closely links ROIC to management performance. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Note (f) to the Consolidated Financial Data – Five Year Summary on page 41 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. That information reflects the revision to the calculation as discussed in the preceding paragraph for all periods presented. 68 Table of Contents Revised Return On Invested Capital Ratio(1) (1) Calculation was revised in 2005. See Note (f) to the Consolidated Financial Summary – Five Year Summary on page 41 for additional information on the calculation. At December 31, 2005, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which expires in July 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2005. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate (as defined). Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. We cancelled our $500 million 364-day credit facility on June 17, 2005. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs, projected over the next three years. 69 Table of Contents Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle other long-term liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these long-term obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5Years After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,986 $ 202 $ 136 $ 248 $ 4,400 Operating lease obligations 1,157 261 386 262 248 Purchase obligations Operating activities 23,566 11,001 7,880 2,752 1,933 Capital expenditures 462 344 118 — — Other long-term liabilities 1,289 213 256 169 651 Total contractual cash obligations $ 31,460 $ 12,021 $ 8,776 $ 3,431 $ 7,232 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to sub-contractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $22 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. However, the U.S. Government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” pursuant to FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform sub-contract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. In addition, we have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table related to capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at various of our locations, related to customer contracts. 70 Table of Contents Amounts related to “Other long-term liabilities” in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2005. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans and environmental liabilities. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party under an agreement entered into in 2000. We also may enter into industrial participation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. Offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. No such penalties have been incurred during the last five years. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $8.4 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, that extend through 2015. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2005 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, as follows: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than1 Year (a) 1-3 Years(a) 3-5Years After 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 2,630 $ 2,425 $ 171 $ 18 $ 16 Surety bonds 434 79 352 3 — Guarantees 2 1 1 — — Total commitments $ 3,066 $ 2,505 $ 524 $ 21 $ 16 (a) Approximately $2,262 million and $49 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” and “1-3 Year” periods, respectively, and approximately $38 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” period, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $200 million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded in the balance sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs 71 Table of Contents incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $2 billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. At December 31, 2005, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as those arrangements are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating rate long-term debt. If interest rates were to change by plus or minus 1%, interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $10 million related to our floating rate debt. The estimated fair values of the Corporation’s long-term debt instruments at December 31, 2005 aggregated approximately $6.2 billion, compared with a carrying amount of approximately $5.0 billion. The majority of our long-term debt obligations are not callable until maturity. We have used interest rate swaps in the past to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates; however, at year-end 2005, we had no such agreements in place. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies, or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended, were not material. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payments, which will impact our net earnings and earnings per share and change the classification of certain elements of the statement of cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires stock options and other share-based payments made to employees to be accounted for as compensation expense and recorded at fair value, and to reflect the related excess tax benefit received upon exercise of the options, if any, in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity inflow rather than an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented. We currently use the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of our stock options in connection with our disclosure of the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized for such options at the date of grant (see Note 1 to the financial statements). 72 Table of Contents We adopted FAS 123(R), and related SEC rules included in SAB No. 107, on a modified prospective basis effective January 1, 2006. We will continue to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the date of adoption. The Lockheed Martin Amended and Restated 2003 Incentive Performance Award Plan provides for the grant of various types of stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units. The types and mix of stock-based incentive awards are evaluated on an ongoing basis and may vary based on management’s overall strategy regarding compensation, including consideration of the impact of the expensing of stock option awards on our results of operations subsequent to the adoption of FAS 123(R). Based on current analyses and information, we expect that the combination of expensing stock options upon adoption of FAS 123(R) in 2006 and grants of restricted stock units will result in additional expense, net of state income tax benefits, totaling approximately $100 million (or a reduction in net earnings per share of $0.15) on a full year basis. We also adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. FIN 47 clarifies the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and requires that a liability and a corresponding increase in the value of the underlying asset be recorded, and depreciation on the increased asset value be expensed, if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by FIN 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, even though the timing and/or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An example of a condition giving rise to an asset retirement obligation is the presence of embedded asbestos, radiation sources or other regulated materials in buildings or equipment. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. This is primarily due to the fact that the fair values of the majority of our asset retirement obligations could not be reasonably estimated because they had indeterminate settlement dates, since the range of time over which we may settle the obligations is unknown and could not be estimated. Consistent with the provisions of FIN 47, each obligation will be recorded at the time the settlement date is no longer indeterminate and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This FSP provides specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy to eligible sponsors of retiree health care benefits provided under this law. Using this guidance, we estimated a projected reduction in our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 of $295 million from the effects of the new law. This obligation will be recognized over the remaining service lives of the employees eligible for the benefit. In January 2005, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services released regulations governing the application of the law and continued to provide clarifying guidance during 2005. Based on this guidance, the impact of adoption of the FSP was a reduction of the FAS 106 postretirement expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $35 million. The postretirement expense computed under FAS 106 does not include the effects of U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards or income tax benefits. The adoption of the FSP did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. 73 Table of Contents Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2005. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005. During 2005, we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on those activities and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Management’s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 76. In addition, both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 77. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 74 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Annual Report includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, notes to those financial statements and a five-year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our Company and focus your review by directing you to some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year. Our Business We principally research, design, develop, manufacture, integrate, operate and sustain advanced technology systems and products, and provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic and information services. We mainly serve customers in domestic and international defense, civil agencies, and homeland security. Our sales to agencies of the U.S. Government, including those to the Department of Defense (DoD), represented 84% of our sales in 2006. Of the remaining 16% of sales, approximately 13% related to sales to international customers (including foreign military sales funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), with the remainder attributable to commercial and other customers. In 2005 and 2004, sales to agencies of the U.S. Government represented 85% and 80% of our total sales, respectively. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and government information technology. We operate in five principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Information Technology & Global Services (IT&GS), and Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S). The name of our IT&GS segment, formerly known as Information & Technology Services, was changed to better reflect the segment’s capabilities and service offerings following the growth experienced by our information technology and business process services businesses and through recent acquisitions. As a lead systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems, including integrated net-centric solutions, to missiles, aircraft and spacecraft. On February 22, 2007, we announced a realignment of our operations to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase our integration of resources. The realignment includes the combination of our IT&GS and IS&S business segments into a new business segment named Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS). In addition, several smaller components of our businesses were realigned as discussed more fully under the caption “Business Segments” in Item 1. Business. These changes do not affect the historical results, discussion or presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Form 10-K. We will begin to report our financial results consistent with this new structure beginning with the first quarter of 2007. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 32 through 55) – provides our management’s view about industry trends, risks and uncertainties relating to Lockheed Martin, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations, including discussions about the key performance drivers of each of our business segments, our financial position and cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events or transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 56 through 58) – include the following: • A report from management, indicating our responsibility for financial reporting, the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting and an assessment of the effectiveness of those controls; • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which includes their opinions on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP which includes their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. Financial statements (pages 59 through 62) – include our consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the last three years, and our balance sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Notes to the financial statements (pages 63 through 90) – provide insight into and are an integral part of our financial statements. The notes contain explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain of the captions on the 32 Table of Contents financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies, and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Highlights The financial section of our Annual Report describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities, and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Page 37 and page 64 Postretirement benefit plans Page 38 and page 77 Environmental matters Page 40, page 64 and page 83 Discussion of business segments Page 43 and page 85 Liquidity and cash flows Page 49 and page 63 Capital structure and resources Page 50, page 60, page 62 and page 74 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 52 and page 82 Stock-based compensation Page 42, page 66 and page 75 Industry Considerations Department of Defense Business The President’s budget proposal for fiscal years 2008-2012 focuses on achieving a balanced budget while addressing the nation’s most critical needs and prosecuting the global war on terrorism. The Administration’s priorities include a strong national defense, tax relief to support economic growth, enhanced energy security, affordable health care, and further education improvement. Approximately 60% of the budget is devoted to defense and other matters of national security. Customer requirements for defense and related advanced technology systems for 2007 and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war. For fiscal year 2008, the President’s budget includes $481.4 billion for the Department of Defense (the DoD), reflecting the Administration’s commitment to continued modernization of our Armed Forces while prosecuting the war on terrorism. This amount, called the base budget, excludes any funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. These costs, discussed below, are requested as emergency supplemental funding. The fiscal year 2008 DoD base budget is an increase of $45.9 billion, or 10.5% over the fiscal year 2007 base budget. The 2008 DoD base budget includes $101.7 billion for procurement of systems (Procurement) and $75.1 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), known as the investment accounts. The current year’s budget represents a nearly 8% increase in the investment accounts over fiscal year 2007 levels. The Operations and Maintenance accounts, which contain the bulk of funding for training, logistics, services, and other sustainment activities, total approximately $164.7 billion for fiscal year 2008, an increase of $16.1 billion, or nearly 11%, over fiscal year 2007 levels. The balance of the budget, including amounts for military personnel and military construction, is funded at $139.9 billion, compared to the fiscal year 2007 level of $130.5 billion. Over the Fiscal Years 2008-2012 Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), total DoD funding is expected to rise to $538.5 billion in 2012, or 23.7% higher than the fiscal year 2007 budget. Total funding for the DoD over the first four years covered by the fiscal year 2008 FYDP proposal is $2,047 billion, an increase of $100 billion from the corresponding four fiscal years in the fiscal year 2007 plan released one year ago. In addition to the base DoD budget, the 2008 budget proposal includes $285.1 billion in supplemental funding for those activities not funded in the base budget for fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009, bringing the grand total for DoD requested in the President’s February 5, 2007 budget proposal to $766.5 billion. As part of the supplemental amounts, the Administration is again requesting funding to defray costs for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. For fiscal year 2007, the Administration is requesting $93.4 billion for DoD, in addition to the $70 billion already approved by Congress in the fiscal year 2007 DoD Appropriations Act. For fiscal year 2008, the Administration has included a request for $141.7 billion in supplemental, or bridge, funding for anticipated, but not yet fully defined, war-related costs that are 33 Table of Contents expected to be needed early in fiscal year 2008. In addition, the Administration has included an estimate of $50 billion in the fiscal year 2009 DoD budget projection for continuing costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan deployments. Spending for procurement of equipment and systems comprises about 24%, or $72.6 billion, of these requested supplemental funds for fiscal year 2007 and 2008, reflecting the Administration’s broadened definition of emergency funding related to the global war on terrorism. Supplemental funding enables the DoD to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs, versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. While Congress has expressed concern about the size of supplemental budgets, it is unlikely that funding for ongoing operations will be significantly curtailed by Congress and, thus, we do not believe that operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will materially impact the investment accounts in the near term. We believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD. Our strong positions in air-power projection, precision-strike capability, and air mobility aircraft are strongly supported in the 2008 DoD budget request. Two of our more significant programs are the F-22 Raptor air dominance fighter and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The President’s fiscal year 2008 budget request includes $4.6 billion for the F-22 program to continue production of the aircraft under a multiyear contract expected to be entered into this year, and $6.1 billion for the F-35 program, including procurement of 12 aircraft. In addition, funding of $420 million is proposed to support the last year of production under the C-130J multiyear contract, with 29 additional aircraft included in the supplemental funding requests. The Air Force budget also supports our contract to upgrade the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. We are also represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the AEGIS weapon system program, the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) program. In the areas of space intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, and the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H), and in classified programs. We are broadly positioned across the DoD in the area of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), including the Air Operations Center Weapons System Integrator (AOC WSI), the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (WIN-T), the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System (CCIC2S), and the Global Communications Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF). We have expanded into adjacent military product lines utilizing our existing advanced technology products and services. Both the Littoral Combat Ship and the VH-71 U.S. Presidential Helicopter programs are supported in the budget request. We are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the DoD. We are continuing to pursue opportunities to expand our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers and improve supply chain management, and we see opportunities to grow our business in outsourcing of service functions and business process management. Recent acquisitions, such as Savi Technology, Inc., Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE) and Aspen Systems Corporation, support our access to new business within the DoD and other agencies of the U.S. Government. Most of the aforementioned programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles. There is always an inherent risk that these and other DoD programs which are subject to annual appropriation by Congress could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs. Non-Department of Defense Business The war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and the need for better communication and interoperability among law enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies, and our military services. Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Library of Congress. Certain of our acquisition activities, such as the acquisition of PAE in 2006, have also given us access to new customers outside of the DoD, such as the Department of State. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the EPA, as well for the DoD. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle 34 Table of Contents software support, information assurance and enterprise solutions. The expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public/private competitions, enabling the selection in 2005 of Lockheed Martin to operate the Federal Aviation Administration’s Automated Flight Services Station Network. In addition, recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. In addition, the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security and other global security systems solutions. Although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets, they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, particularly the requirement for approval in annual appropriations acts. Other risks are unique to particular programs. For example, although indemnification by the U.S. Government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes. In addition, there are some instances where the U.S. Government could provide indemnification under applicable law, but elects not to do so. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We generally seek, and in certain cases have obtained, limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the SAFETY Act or choose not to do so, we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable. Space Business We provide products and services to NASA, mainly through our Space Systems and IT&GS business segments. In 2006, Space Systems was selected by NASA to design and build the agency’s next-generation human space flight crew transportation system known as Orion, with an initial contract value of approximately $4.0 billion. Orion is a key element of NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration, and is planned to succeed the Space Shuttle in transporting a new generation of human explorers to and from space. In the fiscal year 2008 NASA budget proposal, Orion is supported at a level of $950.8 million. We also have a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. As with the DoD and other government funded programs, our government space programs require annual funding, subject to specific Congressional approval in annual appropriations acts. We continued to receive new orders from the U.S. military in 2006 for satellites to support missile defense, battlefield communications and other defense initiatives. The environment for our commercial satellites business continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. We are managing our commercial satellite business with an expectation of receiving fewer orders due to market constraints. For a discussion of the results of operations of our Space Systems segment, see the “Discussion of Business Segments” section. In December 2006, we completed the formation of United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA), a joint venture with The Boeing Company (Boeing), which combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of our Atlas launch vehicles and Boeing’s Delta launch vehicles. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Atlas and Delta expendable launch vehicles will continue to be available as alternatives on individual launch missions. The joint venture is a limited liability company in which we and Boeing each own 50%. We contributed the assets of our Atlas launch vehicle business to ULA and ULA assumed the liabilities of that business, in exchange for our 50% ownership interest. We are accounting for our investment in ULA under the equity method of accounting. The formation of ULA did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for 2006. In October 2006, we sold our ownership interests in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and ILS International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS). LKEI is a joint venture we had with Russian government-owned space firms which has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets. One of the joint venture partners, Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev), is the manufacturer 35 Table of Contents of the Proton launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services. ILS was a joint venture between LKEI and us to market Atlas and Proton launch vehicles and services. In periods prior to the sale of these interests, we consolidated the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest. Contracts for Proton launch services usually required substantial advances from the customer prior to launch which were included as a liability on our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. At December 31, 2005, those advances totaled $315 million. A sizeable percentage of the advances we received from customers for Proton launch services were sent to Khrunichev and included on our balance sheet in inventories for launches under contract. At December 31, 2005, those payments to Khrunichev totaled $190 million. If a contracted launch service was not provided, the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer by LKEI. In the event LKEI did not refund the advance, we would have been responsible for making the payment to certain customers. Under the sale agreement, we will continue to be responsible to refund advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not refund the advance. Due to this continuing involvement with those customers of ILS, many of the risks related to this business have not been transferred and we did not recognize this transaction as a divestiture for financial reporting purposes. We deferred recognition of a net gain of approximately $60 million that otherwise would have been recognized on the sale of our interests in LKEI and ILS, and have continued to include the related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. Our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon Khrunichev providing the contracted launch services and, in the event the launch services are not provided, ILS’s ability to refund the advance. Through December 31, 2006, all Proton launch services through LKEI were provided according to contract terms. Other Business Considerations As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. We have entered into various joint venture, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business. Some of these business arrangements include foreign partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition Approximately 85% of our sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development and production activities, with the remainder attributable to contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development or production activities. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract. 36 Table of Contents Accounting for Design, Development and Production Contracts Generally, we record long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price development and production contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F-22 Raptor program and the AEGIS Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low level of initial production units in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Incentives and award fees related to performance on design, development and production contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), and the availability and timing of funding from our customer. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. Products and services provided under long-term design, development and production contracts represent approximately 85% of our sales for 2006. Therefore, the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design, development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point, our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately $215 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period. 37 Table of Contents Accounting for Other Services Contracts Revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design, development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred, depending on the contract. This methodology is mainly used by our Information Technology & Global Services segment. Services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred, except that initial “set-up” costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement. Operating profit related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date of award. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans), and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. Non-union represented employees hired after January 1, 2006 do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a new defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. Those employees have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions and FAS 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). FAS 158 was adopted as of December 31, 2006. FAS 87 requires that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and, in the case of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, past investment experience, judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. An example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in 2006. The discount rate assumption is based on available yields on high-quality fixed income investments. After reviewing yields on high-quality 38 Table of Contents long-term bonds at the end of 2006, and how those yields might apply to our projected pension cash flows, we increased our discount rate assumption to 5.875% at December 31, 2006, compared to 5.625% used at the end of 2005. This change, together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years, resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for 2007 will decrease by approximately 25% as compared to 2006 expense. At the end of 2006, prior to our adoption of FAS 158, we recorded a noncash after-tax adjustment in stockholders’ equity to reflect a minimum pension liability for many of our pension plans. We calculated the minimum pension liability on a plan-by-plan basis by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for each plan to the fair value of that plan’s assets. We recorded the amount by which the ABO exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan, as a minimum pension liability, with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset, if appropriate, and a reduction to stockholders’ equity. In 2006, the minimum pension liability decreased from the balance recorded at December 31, 2005, primarily due to a higher than expected return on benefit plan assets in 2006 and the increase in the discount rate assumption, and therefore we recorded a noncash after-tax adjustment that increased stockholders’ equity by $1,186 million. FAS 158 required us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of the plan. Upon its adoption, we recognized assets for all of our overfunded plans and liabilities for our underfunded plans on our balance sheet at December 31, 2006; recognized an adjustment to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, for previously unrecognized net actuarial losses and prior service cost or credits; and eliminated the minimum pension liability balance and intangible assets related to our plans that had been recorded prior to its adoption. The previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs were netted against the plans’ funded status on our balance sheet in prior periods in accordance with FAS 87. At year-end, the noncash after-tax adjustment we recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the adoption of FAS 158 reduced stockholders’ equity by $3,069 million. The net impact of the minimum liability recognized under FAS 87 and the adjustments recorded under FAS 158 was to reduce our stockholders’ equity by $1,883 million. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore are recognized in our net sales. The total funding requirement for pension plans under CAS in 2006 was $663 million. This is also the CAS expense we recorded for the year and included in our segment results of operations. That amount was funded through discretionary prepayments we made to the plans in 2005. For 2007, we expect our funding requirements and expense under CAS to decrease. Also in 2007, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules. Any additional amounts computed under the IRC rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we made discretionary prepayments of $594 million, $980 million and $485 million, respectively, to the pension trust. Prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the CAS and IRC rules and, as a result, we expect to have no required cash contributions to the pension plans in 2007. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Since the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. See the discussion of “Net Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income” under “Discussion of Business Segments.” In August 2006, the President signed into law new legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public’s concern over the adequacy of such funding. The new law has the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the Internal Revenue Code that most companies will be required to pay, effective in 2008. The legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large U.S. defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding. The legislation also requires the CAS Board to modify its pension accounting rules by 2010 to better align the recovery of pension contributions on U.S. Government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements. The new funding requirements for large U.S. defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of 2011 or the year in which the changes to the CAS rules are effective. 39 Table of Contents Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, cost allowability issues, agreements between PRPs to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below and other factors. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise, we project costs over an appropriate time frame not to exceed 20 years. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the end of 2006, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was $475 million. About 63% of the liability relates to sites in Redlands, Burbank and Glendale, California, and in Great Neck, New York, mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The remainder of the liability relates to other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated. We have recorded assets totaling $386 million at December 31, 2006 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for U.S. Government businesses. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales. Any recoveries we receive from other PRPs or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government sales and cost of sales. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this not only internally, through our independent research and development activities, but also through acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions of 40 Table of Contents businesses during the past several years. Over the last five years, we have paid $2.5 billion to complete 15 such acquisitions. Conversely, we may also explore the sale of businesses, investments and surplus real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. Acquisitions In 2006 and 2005, we completed acquisitions of the following businesses. There were no significant acquisition activities in 2004. Year ended December 31, 2006 – • Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc., a provider of services to support military readiness, peacekeeping missions, nation-building activities, and disaster relief services (included in our IT&GS segment); • Savi Technology, Inc., a developer of active radio frequency identification solutions (included in our IS&S segment); • Aspen Systems Corporation, an information management company that delivers a range of business process and technology solutions (included in our IT&GS segment); • ISX Corporation, a provider of military decision systems and other information technology solutions (included in our Electronic Systems segment); and • HMT Vehicles, a military vehicle design company (included in our Electronic Systems segment). Year ended December 31, 2005 – • The SYTEX Group, Inc., a provider of information technology solutions and technical support services (included in our IT&GS segment); • STASYS Limited, a U.K.-based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability (included in our IS&S segment); • INSYS Group Limited, a U.K.-based diversified supplier of military communications systems, weapons systems and advanced analysis services (included in our Electronic Systems segment); and • Coherent Technologies, Inc., a supplier of high-performance, laser-based remote sensing systems (included in the Space Systems segment). The aggregate cash paid for the 2006 acquisitions, as well as for amounts paid in 2006 related to acquisitions completed in 2005, was $1.1 billion. Additional payments totaling approximately $106 million are required to be made over the next three years related to these acquisitions, with approximately one-half of that amount payable over the next 12 months. The aggregate cash paid for the 2005 acquisitions, as well as for amounts paid in 2005 related to acquisitions completed in prior periods, was $564 million. We accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting, and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Divestitures During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and surplus real estate, as follows: In 2006, we sold the following: • Our ownership interests in LKEI and ILS, as discussed in “Space Business” under “Industry Considerations.” The gain on the sale was deferred pending the provision of launch services for certain customers; • 21 million shares of Inmarsat plc, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $127 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $83 million ($0.19 per share); • The assets of Space Imaging, LLC, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $23 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $15 million ($0.03 per share); and • Certain surplus land in California and Florida, which resulted in an aggregate gain, net of state income taxes, of $51 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $33 million ($0.08 per share). In 2005, we sold the following: • Our interest in NeuStar, Inc., which resulted a gain, net of state income taxes, of $30 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $19 million ($0.04 per share); 41 Table of Contents • 16 million of our Inmarsat plc shares for $89 million. In addition, primarily as a result of a successful initial public offering by Inmarsat, we recognized a gain of $42 million which had previously been deferred. Together, these transactions resulted in gains, net of state income taxes, totaling $126 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $82 million ($0.18 per share); and • Our 25% interest in Intelsat, Ltd., which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $47 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $31 million ($0.07 per share). In 2004, we sold our shares of New Skies Satellites, N.V. (New Skies) which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $91 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $59 million ($0.13 per share). Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded net sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” which follows, describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated sales and operating profit for 2006, 2005 and 2004. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business, and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services. As mentioned previously, most of our services revenues are generated in our Information Technology & Global Services segment. For 2006, net sales were $39.6 billion, a 6% increase over 2005 sales. Sales for 2005 were $37.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to 2004. Sales, as compared to the prior years, increased in all segments except for anticipated reductions at Aeronautics in both 2006 and 2005. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 84% of our sales for 2006, compared to 85% in 2005 and 80% in 2004. Other income and expense, net was $519 million for 2006 compared to $449 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and amounts invested, and gains from the sale of land. Other income and expense, net increased $328 million from 2004 to 2005 due to an increase in investment income, gains from the sale of investments (primarily Intelsat and Inmarsat) and charges in 2004 for the early retirement of debt. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payments, and related rules, on a modified prospective basis (see Note 11). Under this method, we recognize compensation cost related to the estimated fair value of nonvested stock options and restricted stock granted in 2006 and prior years. Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation cost for stock options using the intrinsic value method, but disclosed the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based upon the fair value-based method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock totaling $111 million which is included in the statement of earnings in cost of sales. The net impact to earnings was $70 million ($0.16 per share). Compensation cost related to restricted stock in prior periods was not material. As of December 31, 2006, we had $118 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. 42 Table of Contents State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact on our operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes) of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this Form 10-K is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our operating profit for 2006 was $4.0 billion, an increase of 32% compared to 2005. Our operating profit for 2005 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 43% compared to 2004. Interest expense for 2006 was $361 million, $9 million lower than 2005. Interest expense for 2005 was $370 million, $55 million lower than in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in both years was primarily due to reductions in our debt outstanding. Our effective tax rates were 29.6% for 2006, 30.2% for 2005, and 23.9% for 2004. The effective rates for 2006 and 2005 were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to tax benefits related to extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI) and the tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan. In addition, the rate for 2006 included a tax benefit related to claims we filed with the Internal Revenue Service for additional ETI tax benefits for sales in previous years. This benefit decreased income tax expense by $62 million ($0.14 per share), and reduced our effective tax rate for 2006 by 1.7%. For 2004, our tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate by the tax benefits related to ETI and tax deductible dividends. In addition, the 2004 rate reflected a $144 million ($0.32 per share) reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination, which reduced our effective rate by 8.6%. Net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the fifth consecutive year. We reported net earnings of $2.5 billion ($5.80 per share) in 2006, compared to net earnings of $1.8 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2005 and net earnings of $1.3 billion ($2.83 per share) in 2004. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Information Technology & Global Services (IT&GS) and Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S). Our Aeronautics business segment designs, develops and produces advanced military aircraft, air vehicles and related technologies, primarily for U.S. and allied country military services. Combat aircraft programs include the F-35, F-22 and F-16 aircraft. The F-35 Lightning II is currently in the System Development and Demonstration phase. The successful first flight of the Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL)-variant aircraft took place in 2006. We have been producing the F-22 Raptor since 1997, and delivered 27 to the U.S. Air Force in 2006. We also received a contract for Production Lot 6 (24 aircraft) and advanced procurement funding for Production Lots 7, 8 and 9. A total of 67 F-16 Fighting Falcons were delivered in 2006. Sales at Aeronautics are expected to decline slightly in 2007, with a more substantial decline expected in 2008 primarily due to a projected reduction in F-16 revenue. In the area of Air Mobility, we produce the C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. We delivered 12 aircraft in 2006 to the U.S. military. A total of 186 have been ordered, with 147 of those delivered through 2006. In addition to aircraft production, the segment provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification and services for its aircraft. The Electronic Systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services. Many of their activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. This business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator, as demonstrated with its role as the prime contractor on the Littoral Combat Ship program, which launched its first ship in 2006, and the Presidential Helicopter program. The Space Systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions, primarily to our U.S. Government customers. Growth will depend on our government satellite and missile defense businesses, as well as activities associated with the NASA Orion program. With the formation of ULA and the sale of our interests in LKEI and ILS, growth in the segment will be less dependent on launch vehicles. Launch services to our U.S. Government customers are expected to be provided by ULA. The IT&GS and IS&S business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense, intelligence and other government customers, including expanding those capabilities through our acquisition activities over the past two years. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies. 43 Table of Contents In the following table of financial data, total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. The reconciling item “Net unallocated Corporate expense” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see the discussion of “Postretirement Benefit Plans” under “Critical Accounting Policies”), earnings and losses from equity investments, interest income, costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 11,401 $ 11,672 $ 11,785 Electronic Systems 11,304 10,580 9,729 Space Systems 7,923 6,820 6,359 Information Technology & Global Services 4,605 4,010 3,802 Integrated Systems & Solutions 4,387 4,131 3,851 $ 39,620 $ 37,213 $ 35,526 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,170 $ 994 $ 899 Electronic Systems 1,297 1,113 969 Space Systems 746 609 489 Information Technology & Global Services 430 351 285 Integrated Systems & Solutions 405 365 334 Total business segments 4,048 3,432 2,976 Net unallocated Corporate expense (95 ) (446 ) (887 ) $ 3,953 $ 2,986 $ 2,089 The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $76 billion and $75 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This amount included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $41 billion at December 31, 2006. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 15 to the financial statements. Segment Operating Profit (In millions) 44 Table of Contents Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 11,401 $ 11,672 $ 11,785 Operating profit 1,170 994 899 Backlog at year-end 25,464 29,580 30,489 Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 2% in 2006 compared to 2005. The anticipated decline in net sales was due to a decline in Air Mobility sales that was partially offset by an increase in Combat Aircraft sales. Air Mobility sales declined by $524 million primarily due to C-130J deliveries (12 in 2006 compared to 15 in 2005) and lower volume on the C-5 program. Combat Aircraft sales increased by $279 million mainly due to higher F-35 and F-22 volume, partially offset by reduced volume on F-16 programs. Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 1% in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was mainly due to anticipated declines in Combat Aircraft, which were partially offset by growth in Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft sales decreased by $480 million for the year primarily due to declines in F-16 volume, which more than offset higher F-35 and F-22 volume. The sales growth in Air Mobility was due to additional C-130J deliveries (15 in 2005 compared to 13 in 2004) and higher volume on other Air Mobility programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 18% in 2006 compared to 2005. Combat Aircraft operating profit increased by $111 million, mainly due to higher volume on the F-35 and F-22 programs, and improved performance on F-16 programs. The improvement for the year was also attributable in part to the fact that in 2005, operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the F-35 program. Air Mobility operating profit increased $73 million, mainly due to improved performance on C-130J sustainment activities in 2006. Operating profit for the segment increased by 11% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher Air Mobility operating profit that exceeded a decline in Combat Aircraft operating profit. Air Mobility operating profit increased $100 million mainly due to improved performance and increased deliveries on the C-130J program. Combat Aircraft operating profit declined due to decreased F-16 deliveries (69 in 2005 compared to 83 in 2004) and reduced earnings on the F-35 development program, which more than offset increased volume and improved performance on the F-22 program. Backlog decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily as a result of sales volume on the F-35 program. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 11,304 $ 10,580 $ 9,729 Operating profit 1,297 1,113 969 Backlog at year-end 20,994 19,932 18,239 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 7% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Higher volume in platform integration activities led to increased sales of $344 million at Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS). Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) sales increased $267 million primarily due to surface systems activities. Air defense programs contributed to increased sales of $118 million at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). Net sales for Electronic Systems increased 9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Higher volume in tactical and surface systems programs contributed to increased sales of $495 million at MS2. PT&TS sales increased $310 million primarily due to platform integration activities. Air defense and fire control programs contributed to increased sales of $40 million at M&FC. Operating profit for the segment increased by 17% in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit increased by $75 million at MS2 mainly due to higher volume on surface systems and undersea programs. Higher volume on air defense programs contributed to a $56 million increase in operating profit at M&FC. PT&TS operating profit increased $54 million mainly due to improved performance on distribution technology activities. 45 Table of Contents Operating profit for the segment increased by 15% in 2005 compared to 2004. Operating profit increased by $80 million at M&FC mainly due to improved performance on fire control and air defense programs. Performance on surface systems programs contributed to an increase in operating profit of $50 million at MS2. PT&TS operating profit increased $10 million primarily due to improved performance on simulation and training programs. The increase in backlog during 2006 over 2005 resulted primarily from increased orders on certain platform integration programs in PT&TS. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 7,923 $ 6,820 $ 6,359 Operating profit 746 609 489 Backlog at year-end 18,768 15,925 16,112 Net Sales for Space Systems increased by 16% in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, sales growth in Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) offset declines in Space Transportation. The $1.1 billion growth in Satellites sales was mainly due to higher volume on both government and commercial satellite programs. There were five commercial satellite deliveries in 2006 compared to no deliveries in 2005. Higher volume in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs accounted for the $114 million sales increase at S&DMS. In Space Transportation, sales declined $102 million primarily due to lower volume in government space transportation activities on the Titan and External Tank programs. Increased sales on the Atlas Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Launch Capabilities (ELC) contract partially offset the lower government space transportation sales. Net sales for Space Systems increased by 7% in 2005 compared to 2004. During the year, sales growth in Satellites and S&DMS offset declines in Space Transportation. The $410 million increase in Satellites sales was due to higher volume on government satellite programs that more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities. There were no commercial satellite deliveries in 2005, compared to four in 2004. Increased sales of $235 million in S&DMS were attributable to the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. The $180 million decrease in Space Transportation’s sales was mainly due to having three Atlas launches in 2005 compared to six in 2004. Operating profit for the segment increased 22% in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit increased in Satellites, Space Transportation and S&DMS. The $72 million growth in Satellites operating profit was primarily driven by the volume and performance on government satellite programs and commercial satellite deliveries. In Space Transportation, the $39 million growth in operating profit was attributable to improved performance on the Atlas program resulting from risk reduction activities, including the first quarter definitization of the ELC contract. In S&DMS, the $26 million increase in operating profit was due to higher volume and improved performance on both the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. Operating profit for the segment increased 25% in 2005 compared to 2004. Operating profit increased in Space Transportation, S&DMS and Satellites. In Space Transportation, the $60 million increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to improved performance on the Atlas vehicle program. Satellites’ operating profit increased $35 million due to the higher volume and improved performance on government satellite programs, which more than offset the decreased operating profit due to the decline in commercial satellite deliveries. The $20 million increase in S&DMS was attributable to higher volume on fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. In December 2006, we completed a transaction with Boeing to form ULA, a joint venture which combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of our Atlas launch vehicles and Boeing’s Delta launch vehicles (see related discussion on our “Space Business” under “Industry Considerations”). We are accounting for our investment in ULA under the equity method of accounting. As a result, our share of the net earnings or losses of ULA are included in other income and expenses, and we will no longer recognize sales related to launch vehicle services provided to the U.S. Government. In 2006, we recorded sales to the U.S. Government for Atlas launch services totaling approximately $600 million. We have retained the right to market commercial Atlas launch services. We contributed assets to ULA, and ULA assumed liabilities related to our Atlas business in exchange for our 50% ownership interest. The net book value of the assets contributed and liabilities assumed was approximately $200 million at 46 Table of Contents December 1, 2006, the date of closing. We accounted for the transfer at net book value, with no gain or loss recognized. If our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets exceeds the book value of our investment, we would recognize the difference ratably over the next 10 years in other income and expenses. We currently anticipate that our 50% ownership share of ULA’s net assets will exceed the book value of our investment in ULA, but that amount remains subject to adjustment based on the final working capital and value of other assets which we and Boeing contributed to ULA. In addition, under our agreement with Boeing, we could be required to make an additional cash contribution to ULA based on changes in the working capital of the business and other assets contributed. Any additional capital contribution would have the effect of increasing our investment and decreasing the difference between our investment and our share of ULA’s net assets. This would decrease the amount that we would amortize and recognize in other income and expenses in the future. We currently estimate that the amount by which our share of ULA’s net assets will exceed our investment will be between $200 million and $300 million. Both we and Boeing also have agreed to provide approximately $225 million in additional funding to ULA. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided $3 million of additional funding to ULA (see Note 14). The formation of ULA did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for 2006. We sold our ownership interests in LKEI and ILS in October 2006 (see related discussion on our “Space Business” under “Industry Considerations”). LKEI is a joint venture we had with Russian government-owned space firms which has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets. In periods prior to the sale of these interests, we consolidated the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest. In 2006, we recorded sales related to Proton launch services totaling approximately $110 million. The increase in backlog during 2006 as compared to 2005 was mainly due to order volume related to the Orion program and government satellite programs, partially offset by a $2.6 billion decrease in backlog resulting from the formation of ULA and the sale of our interests in LKEI and ILS. Information Technology & Global Services Information Technology & Global Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 4,605 $ 4,010 $ 3,802 Operating profit 430 351 285 Backlog at year-end 5,680 5,414 4,560 Net sales for IT&GS increased by 15% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of $642 million in Information Technology and Defense Services. The sales increases include the impact of organic growth as well as the purchase of Pacific Architects and Engineers in September 2006. Net sales for IT&GS increased by 5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volumes of $460 million in Information Technology and Defense Services, which more than offset a sales decline of $250 million in NASA programs. Information Technology’s sales increase includes the impact of organic growth and the purchase of SYTEX in March 2005. Operating profit for the segment increased by 23% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and in 2005 as compared to 2004. The operating profit increase in both years was mainly due to higher volume and improved performance in Information Technology and Defense Services. The IT&GS backlog for 2006 compared to 2005 remained relatively unchanged. Integrated Systems & Solutions Integrated Systems & Solutions’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 4,387 $ 4,131 $ 3,851 Operating profit 405 365 334 Backlog at year-end 4,999 3,974 4,586 47 Table of Contents Net sales for IS&S increased by 6% in 2006 as compared to 2005 and by 7% in 2005 as compared to 2004. For both comparative periods, the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 11% in 2006 as compared to 2005 and by 9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increases in operating profit for both comparative periods were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above. The increase in backlog during 2006 compared to 2005 was due to order volume in intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net The following table shows the components of net unallocated Corporate (expense) income. (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (275 ) $ (626 ) $ (595 ) Items not considered in segment operating performance 214 173 (215 ) Stock compensation expense (111 ) — — Other, net 77 7 (77 ) $ (95 ) $ (446 ) $ (887 ) The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS and pension expense determined in accordance with FAS 87. That difference is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit. The CAS funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments’ cost of goods sold. A majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing, and is consequently included in the segments’ sales. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS expense, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 FAS 87 expense $ (938 ) $ (1,124 ) $ (884 ) Less: CAS expense and funding (663 ) (498 ) (289 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – expense $ (275 ) $ (626 ) $ (595 ) FAS 87 expense decreased in 2006 primarily due to the change in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets in 2006, including contributions we made to the pension trust. Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach promulgated by FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. For example, gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by Corporate, as well as other Corporate activities such as charges recorded related to the early repayment of debt, are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following items were included in “Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net” for 2006, 2005 and 2004: (In millions, except per share data) Operating Profit (Loss) Net Earnings(Loss) Earnings (Loss) Per Share Year ended December 31, 2006 Gain on sale of interest in Inmarsat $ 127 $ 83 $ 0.19 Gains on sale of surplus land 51 33 0.08 Earnings from expiration of AES transaction indemnification 29 19 0.04 Gain on sale of Space Imaging’s assets 23 15 0.03 Debt exchange expenses (16 ) (11 ) (0.03 ) Benefit from claims for ETI tax benefits — 62 0.14 $ 214 $ 201 $ 0.45 48 Table of Contents (In millions, except per share data) Operating Profit (Loss) Net Earnings(Loss) Earnings (Loss) Per Share Year ended December 31, 2005 Gains related to Inmarsat transactions $ 126 $ 82 $ 0.18 Gain on sale of interest in Intelsat 47 31 0.07 Gain on sale of interest in NeuStar 30 19 0.04 Impairment charge related to a satellite (30 ) (19 ) (0.04 ) $ 173 $ 113 $ 0.25 Year ended December 31, 2004 Charge for Pit 9 litigation $ (180 ) $ (117 ) $ (0.26 ) Charge for early retirement of debt (154 ) (100 ) (0.22 ) Gain on sale of interest in New Skies 91 59 0.13 Gain on sale of COMSAT General business 28 4 0.01 Benefit from closure of an IRS examination — 144 0.32 $ (215 ) $ (10 ) $ (0.02 ) We adopted FAS 123(R) Share-Based Payments on January 1, 2006 and recognized stock compensation expense of $111 million ($70 million after-tax or $0.16 per share) for year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the “Other, net” component of unallocated Corporate (expense) income net of $70 million from 2005 to 2006 and $84 million from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest income from higher interest rates and amounts invested. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), made selective acquisitions of businesses, repurchased shares, increased our dividends and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt. The following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $589 million to $3.8 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005 after having increased by $270 million to $3.2 billion in 2005 as compared to 2004. In 2006, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $704 million, and also to an increase in working capital improvements of $150 million compared to 2005. The remaining change in cash between the periods was due to income tax payments, postretirement benefit plan contributions, and the timing of various other operating activities. In 2005, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $559 million as compared to 2004, which more than offset a $386 million reduction in working capital improvements between the years. The remaining increase in cash between those periods was due to income tax payments and the timing of various other operating activities. The focus on improving our cash management processes continues to contribute to the aggregate reduction in operating working capital accounts (receivables, 49 Table of Contents inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred), including an aggregate reduction of $256 million in 2006 as compared to a reduction of $106 million in 2005. Although we will continue to focus on management of operating working capital accounts, we do not expect the rate of improvements we have experienced in prior periods to continue. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $893 million in 2006, $865 million in 2005 and $769 million in 2004. We expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed 2006 expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – We have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our financial targets, help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth. We paid $1,122 million, including amounts related to acquisitions completed in prior years, for the acquisition of new businesses in 2006, compared with $564 million in 2005 and $91 million in 2004. During 2006, we received proceeds of $132 million from the sale of our remaining shares in Inmarsat, $24 million from the sale of assets of Space Imaging, LLC, and $24 million from the sale of Lockheed Martin Intersputnik. During 2005, we received proceeds of $935 million from the divestiture of non-core equity investments. The proceeds included $752 million from the sale of our investment in Intelsat, Ltd., $140 million from the sale of Inmarsat shares and the redemption of certain Inmarsat equity-related investments, and $33 million from the sale of our NeuStar investment. During 2004, we received $140 million from the sale our investment in New Skies Satellites, N.V. and $50 million related to the reduction of our investment in Inmarsat Group Holdings, Ltd. Financing Activities Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to refinance and reduce our long-term debt. During 2006, we paid $353 million to complete an exchange of debt and $210 million related to scheduled debt repayments. In 2005, we used $133 million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long-term debt. In 2004, we used $1.1 billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long-term debt. Of that amount, $951 million related to the early retirement of debt through tender offers for which we incurred $163 million of associated costs. Share repurchases and dividends –We also used cash in each of the last three years for common share repurchase activity as follows: $2,104 million for 27.6 million common shares in 2006, all of which were settled during the year along with $11 million for 0.2 million shares purchased in 2005; $1,222 million for 19.7 million common shares in 2005, of which $1,211 million for 19.5 million of those common shares, as well as $99 million for 1.8 million common shares purchased in 2004, was settled during the year; and $772 million for 14.7 million common shares in 2004, of which $673 million for 12.9 million common shares was settled during the year. Our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 108 million shares of our common stock from time-to-time at management’s discretion, including 20 million of additional shares our Board authorized for repurchase in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased a total of 73.7 million shares under the program, and there remained approximately 34.3 million shares that may be repurchased in the future. The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $538 million in 2006, $462 million in 2005 and $405 million in 2004. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2006 and $0.35 per share for the last quarter of 2006; $0.25 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2005 and $0.30 per share for the last quarter of 2005; and $0.22 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2004 and $0.25 per share for the last quarter of 2004. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2006, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.9 billion and short-term investments of $381 million. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $4.4 billion. Our long-term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures. We have $1.0 billion of convertible debentures that have a floating interest rate based on LIBOR; however, at December 31, 2006, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the debentures for a fixed interest rate. With this swap agreement, our entire long-term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates. 50 Table of Contents In August 2006, we issued $1.1 billion of new 6.15% Notes due 2036 (the New Notes). The New Notes were issued in exchange for a portion of certain then outstanding debt securities (the Old Notes), and cash consideration of $343 million. Holders also received a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest on the Old Notes. We accounted for the transaction as an exchange of debt under EITF 96-19, Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments. The cash consideration of $343 million is being amortized over the life of the New Notes as a discount, using the effective interest method, and recorded in interest expense. The New Notes are included on our balance sheet under the caption long-term debt, net and are presented net of the unamortized discount. The expenses associated with the exchange, net of state income tax benefits, totaled $16 million and reduced net earnings by $11 million ($0.03 per share). Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $6.9 billion at December 31, 2006, a decrease of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of FAS 158, which required recognition of a $3.1 billion adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the net unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs, as well as the elimination of the previously recorded minimum pension liability and intangible asset, to record the unfunded status of our postretirement benefit plans. That adjustment was partially offset by a $1.2 billion minimum liability adjustment recorded prior to the adoption of FAS 158, resulting in a net decrease of $1.9 billion. See the discussion of “Postretirement Benefit Plans” under “Critical Accounting Policies” and disclosure in Note 12 for additional information. Net earnings and stock plan activities more than offset the reduction in stockholders’ equity as a result of our share repurchases and the payment of dividends. Through our debt repayment activities, our long-term debt balance has declined $3.1 billion over the last five years from $7.5 billion at December 31, 2001. Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 39% at December 31, 2006, unchanged from 39% at December 31, 2005. Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio Return on invested capital (ROIC) improved by 470 basis points during 2006 to 19.2%. We define ROIC as net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholder’s equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans, including those for minimum pension liabilities and, for 2006, the adoption of FAS 158. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. We use ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Consolidated Financial Data – Five Year Summary on page 30 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. 51 Table of Contents Return On Invested Capital Ratio At December 31, 2006, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which expires in July 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2006. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate (as defined). Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs, projected over the next three years. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle other long-term liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these long-term obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt(a) $ 4,784 $ 34 $ 347 $ 2 $ 4,401 Other long-term liabilities 1,651 276 388 194 793 Operating lease obligations 1,145 288 465 271 121 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 22,771 12,996 7,520 1,561 694 Capital expenditures 302 264 38 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 30,653 $ 13,858 $ 8,758 $ 2,028 $ 6,009 (a) The total amount of long-term debt excludes unamortized discounts of $345 million (see Note 7). 52 Table of Contents Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Amounts related to other long-term liabilities in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2006. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to sub-contractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $22 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. However, the U.S. Government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” pursuant to FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for their convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform sub-contract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at various of our locations, related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial participation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. Offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. No such penalties have been incurred during the last five years. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $8.2 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, that extend through 2016. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2006 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. With respect to the formation of ULA, both we and Boeing have committed to provide up to $25 million each as additional capital contributions and $200 million each in other financial support to ULA, as required. The non-capital funding will be made in the form of a revolving credit agreement between us and ULA or guarantees of ULA financing with third parties, in either case, to the extent necessary for ULA to meet its working capital needs. We have agreed to provide this support for at least five years, and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand. To satisfy our non-capital financial support commitment, we and Boeing put into place at closing a revolving credit agreement with ULA. At December 31, 2006, we had made $3 million in payments under our capital contribution commitment, and no amounts had been drawn on the revolving credit agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified ULA related to certain financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations and that it will not be necessary to fulfill the guarantees contemplated under the cross-indemnities. We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our 53 Table of Contents contracts. In some cases, we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, as follows: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than 1Year (a) 1-3 Years (a) 3-5Years After 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 2,571 $ 2,421 $ 95 $ 49 $ 6 Surety bonds 502 204 298 — — Guarantees 21 — 21 — — Total commitments $ 3,094 $ 2,625 $ 414 $ 49 $ 6 (a) Approximately $2,260 million and $18 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” and “1-3 Year” periods, respectively, and approximately $44 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” period, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $180 million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $2.0 billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in LKEI and ILS (see related discussion on our “Space Business” under “Industry Considerations”), we will continue to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not refund the advance. We expect to recognize the $60 million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires, which we generally believe will be in 2008 based on the expected Proton launch schedule, which is subject to change. Our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon Khrunichev providing the contracted launch services or, in the event the launch services are not provided, ILS’s ability to refund the advance. The amount we could be required to pay is expected to increase over time due to the payment of additional advances by the customers to ILS related to the specific launches we have guaranteed, and will be reduced by the occurrence of those launches. At December 31, 2006, the total amount that could be payable under the guarantees, approximating the total contract value of the guaranteed launches, was $344 million. That amount may be partially mitigated by approximately $70 million of cash we retained that, absent any requirements to make payments under the guarantees, will be paid to the buyer over time as the launches occur. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2006 included current and noncurrent assets relating to LKEI and ILS totaling $265 million, and current and noncurrent liabilities totaling $335 million, both of which will be reduced as the launch services are provided. The assets relate primarily to advances we have made to Khrunichev for future launches, and the liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches. Any potential earnings impact resulting from our inability to realize the assets we have recorded related to LKEI and ILS would be partially mitigated by our not recognizing the deferred gain on the transaction. Through December 31, 2006, Proton launch services provided through ILS were provided according to contract terms. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2006, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our $1.0 billion of convertible debentures based on LIBOR for a fixed interest rate through August 15, 2008. With this swap agreement, our long-term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates. We have designated the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted LIBOR-based variable interest payments. Based on our evaluation at the inception of the hedging agreement and in subsequent periods, we expect the hedging relationship to be highly effective in achieving the offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged variable interest payments, resulting in a fixed net interest expense reported on the statement of earnings. We determined that the hedging relationship remained effective at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was not material. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in 54 Table of Contents cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies, or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended, were not material. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which is effective January 1, 2007. The purpose of FIN 48 is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation, which is required to be reported separately as a noncash adjustment to the opening balance of our retained earnings in 2007, is currently not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2006. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006. During 2006, we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on those activities and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Management’s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 56. In addition, both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 57. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Form 10-K includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and a five year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our Company and alert you as to some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year. Our Business We principally research, design, develop, manufacture, integrate, operate and sustain advanced technology systems and products, and provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic and information services. We mainly serve customers in domestic and international defense, civil agencies, and homeland security. Our sales to agencies of the U.S. Government, including those to the Department of Defense (DoD), represented 84% of our sales in 2007. Of the remaining 16% of sales, approximately 13% related to sales to international customers (including foreign military sales funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), with the remainder attributable to commercial and other customers. In 2006 and 2005, sales to agencies of the U.S. Government represented 84% and 85% of our total sales. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and government information technology. In February 2007, we announced a realignment of our operations to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase our integration of resources. The realignment included the combination of our former Information Technology & Global Services (IT&GS) and Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S) business segments into a new business segment named Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS), along with certain other changes. All business segment disclosures and amounts in this Form 10-K have been reclassified to reflect the realignment. We now operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS and Space Systems. As a lead systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems, including integrated net-centric solutions, to missiles, aircraft and spacecraft. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 32 through 58) – provides our management’s view about industry trends, risks and uncertainties relating to Lockheed Martin, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations, including discussions about the key performance drivers of each of our business segments, our financial position and cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events or transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 59 through 61) – include the following: • A report from management, indicating our responsibility for financial reporting, the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting and an assessment of the effectiveness of those controls; • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which includes their opinion on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP which includes their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. Financial statements (pages 62 through 65) – include our consolidated Statements of Earnings, Cash Flows and Stockholders’ Equity for each of the last three years, and our Balance Sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Notes to the financial statements (pages 66 through 95) – provide insight into and are an integral part of our financial statements. The notes contain explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain of the captions on the financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies, and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 32 Table of Contents Highlights The financial section of our Form 10-K describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities, and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Page 37 and page 67 Postretirement benefit plans Page 38 and page 83 Environmental matters Page 39, page 67 and page 89 Goodwill Page 40 and page 67 Stock-based compensation Page 41, page 69 and page 80 Discussion of business segments Page 44 and page 90 Liquidity and cash flows Page 51 and page 64 Capital structure and resources Page 52, page 63, page 65 and page 79 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 54 and page 87 Income taxes Page 69 and page 77 Industry Considerations U.S. Government – Department of Defense Business The President’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2009 focuses on ensuring America’s economic prosperity and keeping our country safe. The Administration’s priorities include balancing the budget by 2012, combating terrorism and protecting the homeland, promoting economic growth, and controlling non-security and entitlement spending. Over half of the discretionary spending in the budget proposal is allocated to defense and other security needs to be addressed by the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and State – all key customers of ours. For fiscal year 2009, the President’s budget proposes $515.4 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD), reflecting the Administration’s commitment to continued modernization of our Armed Forces and sustainment of current capabilities. This amount, called the base budget, excludes any funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan or the global war on terrorism. These costs, discussed below, are requested as emergency supplemental funding. The fiscal year 2009 DoD base budget is an increase of $35.9 billion, or 7.5%, over the fiscal year 2008 base budget as enacted into law at the end of 2007. The 2009 DoD base budget includes $104.2 billion for procurement of systems and equipment (Procurement) and $79.6 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), collectively termed the investment accounts. The proposed investment budget of $183.8 billion represents a nearly 5% increase in the investment accounts over fiscal year 2008 enacted levels and represents a record-high level of funding for these accounts. The Operations and Maintenance accounts, which contain the bulk of funding for training, logistics, services, and other sustainment activities, total approximately $179.8 billion for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $15.6 billion, or nearly 10%, over fiscal year 2008 enacted levels. The balance of the budget, $151.8 billion, includes amounts for military pay and benefits, construction, and other activities. Over the fiscal years 2009-2013, total DoD funding is expected to rise to $549.0 billion in 2013, or 14.4% higher than the fiscal year 2008 budget. Total proposed funding for the DoD over this five-year period is nearly $2.7 trillion, reflecting both the significant increase in the same five-year period in the budget proposal submitted in February of 2007, as well as a small additional increase in this year’s plan. In addition to the base DoD budget, the Administration is again requesting funding to defray costs for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The fiscal year 2009 budget proposal includes $70.0 billion in supplemental funding for the ongoing war on terrorism, which is $20 billion higher than anticipated in last year’s budget proposal. This amount reflects only costs anticipated to be incurred in the first several months of fiscal year 2009 to ensure continuity of funding during the transition to the next Administration, which will begin in January of 2009, and the budget proposal assumes the next Administration will determine what additional amounts may be required for these activities. The 33 Table of Contents budget proposal also assumes Congress will approve the full $183.8 billion in supplemental funding requested for fiscal year 2008, of which only $86.8 billion had been approved at the time of the budget submission. Total funding requested for the fiscal year 2009 base and supplemental budgets is $585.4 billion. Details of the supplemental funding request have not yet been released. Supplemental funding enables the DoD to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs, versus using funds available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. While Congress has expressed concern about the size of supplemental budgets, funding for ongoing operations has not been significantly curtailed by Congress. We expect that Congress will approve the remaining fiscal year 2008 supplemental funding in a timely fashion, and, thus, we do not believe that the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will materially impact the investment accounts in the near term. We believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD. Our key aircraft programs are strongly supported in the fiscal year 2009 DoD budget request. The request includes $4.0 billion for 20 F-22 Raptor air dominance fighter aircraft produced under a multiyear contract entered into in 2007, and $6.7 billion for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program. Funding of $933 million is proposed for procurement of 8 C-130J aircraft, as well as advance procurement for 16 additional C-130Js. The budget also includes $798.2 million to continue upgrades of the C-5 strategic airlift aircraft. The fiscal year 2009 budget request includes $10.5 billion, an increase of $600 million over fiscal year 2008, for missile defense capabilities. We are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the AEGIS weapon system program, the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) program. In the areas of space-based intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H) and classified programs. Space-based systems are robustly funded in the fiscal year 2009 request at $10.7 billion. The fiscal year 2009 budget proposes $16.4 billion for an array of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs. We are well-positioned in these capabilities, including the Air Operations Center Weapons System Integrator, the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical, the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System, and the Global Communications Support System – Air Force. We will continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and EQ-36, to our warfighters. We are bringing our systems integration expertise as well as our existing advanced technology products and services into adjacent military product lines, such as the Littoral Combat Ship and the VH-71 U.S. Presidential Helicopter programs, both of which are supported in the fiscal year 2009 budget request. We are well-positioned to expand in these adjacent markets, as well as in unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. We are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the DoD. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers and improving global supply chain management, and we see opportunities to grow our business in providing global services and business process management across the DoD enterprise. Most of the aforementioned programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles. There is always an inherent risk that these and other DoD programs could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs, either in the Administration’s budget reviews or in the Congressional process of annual appropriations. U.S. Government – Non-Department of Defense Business The war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and the need for better communication and interoperability among law enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies, and our military services. Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, Transportation and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Library of Congress. 34 Table of Contents The Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2009 seeks to limit overall growth in the civil agency budgets to one percent per year or less. Despite this limitation on total non-defense discretionary spending in the President’s proposal, our key programs are well supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business. The fiscal year 2009 budget submission for NASA is $17.6 billion, $500 million higher than the fiscal year 2008 level, and our key programs are well supported in the request. The next-generation human space flight crew transportation system, known as the Crew Expeditionary Vehicle (CEV) or Orion, is a key element of NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration and will succeed the Space Shuttle in transporting a new generation of human explorers to and from space. Orion is supported at a level of $1.1 billion in the budget proposal for NASA. Though we have continued to receive new orders from the U.S. military in 2007 for satellites to support missile defense, battlefield communications and other defense initiatives, the environment for our commercial satellites business continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry. We are managing our commercial satellite business with an expectation of receiving fewer orders due to market constraints. The Department of Homeland Security fiscal year 2009 budget request of $37.6 billion is an increase of 7.7% over fiscal year 2008 enacted level. Within the budget, the Coast Guard Deepwater system is funded at $990.4 million. Despite overall decreases in the total budgets for the Departments of Transportation and Justice, the Transportation Workers Identity Card (TWIC) program, the Federal Aviation Administration’s Automated Flight Services Station Network, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Sentinel program are well supported in their respective agency budgets. Other key programs are well supported in the civil agency budgets. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the EPA, as well for the DoD. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance and enterprise solutions. The expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public/private competitions. In addition, recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. In addition, the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. In addition, we may see an increase in demand from the Department of State and the United Nations for mission services, global security and stability operations, and facility services. Similar to the risks inherent in our defense business, funding for our civil agency business is contingent on approval in annual appropriations acts for each of the agencies with which we have business. Major programs may be funded over several annual government budget cycles, with the risk of future reductions or elimination in the Administration’s budget review or in the annual Congressional appropriations process. In the civil government business, some risks are unique to particular programs. For example, although indemnification by the U.S. Government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes. In addition, there are some instances where the U.S. Government could provide indemnification under applicable law, but elects not to do so. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We generally seek, and in certain cases have obtained, limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. SAFETY Act qualification is less useful in mitigating potential liability for international applications of our homeland security products and services. Where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the SAFETY Act or choose not to do so, we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable or when emergency conditions relative to national security make qualification impracticable. 35 Table of Contents Other Business Considerations We have continued the expansion of our business with foreign governments primarily through Aeronautics, Electronic Systems and with IS&GS’ acquisition of PAE in 2006. Our international sales are comprised of “foreign military sales” through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing and production of the F-35 Lightning II. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 24 countries, with 52 follow-on buys from 14 customers. The C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft is currently in service in four foreign countries, and is expanding its international footprint with recent orders from Canada and Norway. With regard to the AEGIS weapon system, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers (e.g., Japan, Korea and Spain). Electronic Systems also produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany and the Netherlands. The acquisition of PAE has increased our presence in certain less developed countries by providing base camp construction, logistics, democratization and management services, among others, generally through our contracts with such customers as the United Nations and the U.S. Department of State. As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we do not believe that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In years in which an appropriations bill has not been signed into law before September 30 (the end of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year), Congress typically passes a continuing resolution that authorizes U.S. Government agencies to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our revenue and profit during the period. We are exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers, and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. We have entered into various joint ventures, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business, since their activities are closely aligned with our operations. For example, we have a 50% equity interest in United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA), which provides the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches on Atlas and Delta launch vehicles, and a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC (USA) which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. Certain of our business arrangements include international partners. The conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In August 2006, the President signed into law legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public’s concern over the adequacy of such funding. The law has the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the Internal Revenue Code that most companies will be required to pay, effective in 2008. The legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large U.S. defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding. The legislation also requires the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board to modify its 36 Table of Contents pension accounting rules by 2010 to better align the recovery of pension contributions on U.S. Government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements. The new funding requirements for large U.S. defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of 2011 or the year in which the changes to the CAS rules are effective. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition Approximately 84% of our sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development and production activities, with the remainder attributable to contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development or production activities. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract. Accounting for Design, Development and Production Contracts Generally, we record long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F-22 Raptor program and the AEGIS Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low rate of initial production units in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method as new contracts for different phases of a program are received after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales and an estimated profit. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Incentives and award fees related to performance on design, development and production contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. 37 Table of Contents Products and services provided under long-term design, development and production contracts represent approximately 84% of our sales for 2007. Therefore, the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design, development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point, our Net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately $225 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Accounting for Services Contracts Revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design, development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred, depending on the contract. This methodology is mainly used by our IS&GS segment. Services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred, except that initial “set-up” costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement. Earnings related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date of award. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans), and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. Non-union represented employees hired after January 1, 2006 do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation. We account for our pension plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) and FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions. FAS 158, which we adopted as of December 31, 2006, required us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans, with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in Stockholders’ equity. Prior to the end of 2006, 38 Table of Contents unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs were netted against the plans’ funded status on our Balance Sheet in accordance with FAS 87. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of the plan. FAS 87 requires that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels, with the more subjective of these being the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and, in the case of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, past investment experience, judgments about future market trends, changes in interest rates and equity market performance. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the PBO at the end of the year as well as the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. These items include quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. At the close of 2007, the annualized Merrill Lynch index for long-term AA corporate bonds (15+ years) was 6.37%. We also calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected pension-related cash flows. Our pension-related cash flows are put into actuarial models that included data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. The available universe of bonds are adjusted to reflect call provisions, outstanding issue amount, and bonds that are considered “outliers.” As of December 31, 2007, the actuarial models calculated rates ranging from 6.35% to 6.57%. The data we collect provides important inputs into our determination of an appropriate discount rate. After reviewing all of the above data, we determined that the most appropriate discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations as of December 31, 2007 would be 6.375%, compared to 5.875% used at the end of 2006. The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 6.375% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2007, with all other assumptions held constant, would decrease or increase the amount of the projected benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2007 by approximately $900 million, resulting in an after-tax increase or decrease in Stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $580 million. If the 5.875% discount rate at December 31, 2006 that was used to compute 2007 pension expense had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense recorded would have been lower or higher by approximately $90 million. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximated by the assumption; therefore, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances should be reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. We record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Note 1 to the financial statements). Judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed, complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies, cost allowability issues, agreements among PRPs to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below and other factors. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal 39 Table of Contents agreements exist, but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We record a liability for the amount within the range which we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or, in cases where no amount within the range is better than another, we record an amount at the low end of the range. We review the estimates periodically and make adjustments to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards). If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our Net sales and Cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the end of 2007, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $572 million. About 40% of the liability relates to former operating sites in Redlands and Burbank, California, mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The remainder of the liability relates to other properties (including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years) for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated. We have recorded assets totaling $480 million at December 31, 2007 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through Cost of sales. Any recoveries we receive from other PRPs or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future U.S. Government Net sales and Cost of sales. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review Goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of Goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which we generally define as the business segment level or one level below the business segment. Our annual testing date is October 1. Performing the Goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment, including estimation of future cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, general market conditions and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate Goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including Goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of Goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. 40 Table of Contents Our Goodwill at December 31, 2007 amounted to $9.4 billion. We completed our assessment of Goodwill as of October 1, 2007 and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our Goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a Goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, a 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at October 1, 2007 would not have resulted in a Goodwill impairment charge. Stock-Based Compensation We account for our stock-based compensation under the provisions of FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payments. We recognize compensation cost related to all share-based payments, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options. Compensation cost for RSUs is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award. We estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our stock options do not include market or performance conditions. We generally recognize the compensation cost for RSUs and stock options ratably over a three-year vesting period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining certain inputs to the model, including a volatility factor for our stock, an expected life of the option and a risk-free interest rate. We estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our daily stock price over the past five years, which is commensurate with the expected life of the options. We base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option, historical trends in employee exercise activity and post-vesting employment termination trends. We analyzed the option exercise patterns of our employees and determined there are no significant differences between employee groups. We base the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We also are required to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant which we base on historical experience. If any of our estimates or assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from the amount recorded in 2007. Compensation cost recognized in 2007 totaled $149 million. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this not only internally, through our independent research and development activities, but also through acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses during the past several years. Over the last five years, we have paid $2.6 billion to complete 18 such acquisitions. Conversely, we may also explore the divestiture of businesses, investments and real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such assets, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are completed and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. Acquisitions We used approximately $160 million in 2007 for acquisition activities including the acquisition of, among others, Management Systems Designers Inc. (MSD), a provider of information technology (IT) and scientific solutions supporting government life science, national security, and other civil agency missions. The amount also includes certain payments related to acquisitions completed in prior years. The acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2007. In 2006 and 2005, we completed acquisitions of the following businesses: Year ended December 31, 2006 – • Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc., a provider of services to support military readiness, peacekeeping missions, nation-building activities, and disaster relief services (included in our IS&GS segment); • Savi Technology, Inc., a developer of active radio frequency identification solutions (included in our IS&GS segment); • Aspen Systems Corporation, an information management company that delivers a range of business process and technology solutions (included in our IS&GS segment); • ISX Corporation, a provider of military decision systems and other information technology solutions (included in our Electronic Systems segment); and • HMT Vehicles, a military vehicle design company (included in our Electronic Systems segment). Year ended December 31, 2005 – • The SYTEX Group, Inc., a provider of information technology solutions and technical support services (included in our IS&GS segment); 41 Table of Contents • STASYS Limited, a U.K.-based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability (included in our IS&GS segment); • INSYS Group Limited, a U.K.-based diversified supplier of military communications systems, weapons systems and advanced analysis services (included in our Electronic Systems segment); and • Coherent Technologies, Inc., a supplier of high-performance, laser-based remote sensing systems (included in the Space Systems segment). The aggregate cash paid for the 2006 acquisitions, as well as for amounts paid in 2006 related to acquisitions completed in 2005, was $1.1 billion. The aggregate cash paid for the 2005 acquisitions, as well as for amounts paid in 2005 related to acquisitions completed in prior periods, was $564 million. We accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting, and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2006 or 2005. Divestitures During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and real estate by divesting of the following: Year ended December 31, 2007 • Our remaining 20% interest in Comsat International, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share); and • Certain land in California, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share). Year ended December 31, 2006 • Our ownership interests in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS). The gain on the sale was deferred pending the disposition of guarantees associated with providing launch services for certain customers (see Note 2); • 21 million shares of Inmarsat plc, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $127 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $83 million ($0.19 per share); • The assets of Space Imaging, LLC, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $23 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $15 million ($0.03 per share); and • Certain land in California and Florida, which resulted in an aggregate gain, net of state income taxes, of $51 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $33 million ($0.08 per share). Year ended December 31, 2005 • Our interest in NeuStar, Inc., which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $30 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $19 million ($0.04 per share); • 16 million of our Inmarsat plc shares for $89 million. In addition, primarily as a result of a successful initial public offering by Inmarsat, we recognized a gain of $42 million which had previously been deferred. Together, these transactions resulted in gains, net of state income taxes, totaling $126 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $82 million ($0.18 per share); and • Our 25% interest in Intelsat, Ltd., which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $47 million in Other income (expense), net, and increased Net earnings by $31 million ($0.07 per share). United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the formation of ULA (see Note 2) with The Boeing Company (Boeing). The net book value of the assets we contributed and the liabilities that ULA assumed from us was initially determined to be $190 million as of the date of closing. We accounted for the transfer at net book value, with no gain or loss recognized. In July 2007, we reached agreement with Boeing with respect to resolution of the final working capital and the value of the launch vehicle support contracts that we each contributed to form ULA, as contemplated by the original agreements. In connection with the resolution agreements, we made additional contributions to ULA in respect of the working capital adjustment totaling $177 million which resulted in an increase in our investment in ULA. ULA also conformed the accounting policies of the contributed businesses. The adoption of conformed accounting policies affected the book value of the assets and liabilities that each of us contributed and resulted in adjustments to ULA’s balance sheet as of December 1, 2006. After the agreement was implemented and the adjustments were recorded, our 50% ownership share of ULA’s net assets exceeded the book value of our investment by approximately $395 million, which we are recognizing ratably over 10 years 42 Table of Contents as Equity in net earnings (losses) of equity investees in Other income (expense), net. Our investment in ULA totaled $402 million and $197 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. ULA did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows in 2007. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded net sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our Statement of Earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” which follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated Net sales and Operating profit for 2007, 2006 and 2005. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business, and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems and Space Systems segments, while most of our services revenues are generated in our IS&GS segment. For 2007, Net sales were $41.9 billion, a 6% increase over 2006 sales. Sales for 2006 were $39.6 billion, a 6% increase over 2005 sales. Sales increased during 2007 in all segments as compared to 2006. Except for anticipated reductions at Aeronautics, sales increased in all segments in 2006 as compared to 2005. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 84% of our sales in 2007, 84% in 2006, and 85% in 2005. Other income (expense), net was $293 million for 2007 compared to $336 million in 2006. This decrease was primarily due to gains recognized in 2006 from the sale of shares of Inmarsat and assets of Space Imaging, offset partially by increased equity earnings in affiliates in 2007. Other income (expense), net increased $20 million from 2005 to 2006 due to higher equity earnings in affiliates and gains from the sale of land in 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payments, and related rules, on a modified prospective basis (see Note 11). Under this method, we recognize compensation cost related to the estimated fair value of nonvested stock options and restricted stock granted in 2006 and prior years. Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation cost for stock options using the intrinsic value method, but disclosed the pro forma effects on Net earnings and Earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based upon the fair value-based method. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recorded compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock totaling $149 million and $111 million which is included in the Statement of Earnings in Cost of sales. The net impact to earnings was $96 million ($0.22 per share) and $70 million ($0.16 per share). Compensation cost related to restricted stock in 2005 was not material. As of December 31, 2007, we had $136 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our Net sales and Cost of sales. As a result, the impact on our Operating profit of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this Form 10-K is disclosed net of state income taxes. 43 Table of Contents Our Operating profit for 2007 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 20% compared to 2006. Our Operating profit for 2006 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 32% compared to 2005. Operating profit increased across all business segments in both comparative periods and was also favorably impacted by lower Unallocated Corporate costs, primarily due to a decline in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment. Interest expense for 2007 was $352 million, $9 million lower than 2006. This decrease was mainly driven by lower interest expense associated with the September 2006 debt exchange. Interest expense for 2006 was $361 million, $9 million lower than in 2005. This decrease in interest expense primarily was due to reductions in our debt outstanding. Other non-operating income (expense), net totaled $193 million in 2007, an increase of 5% from 2006, and was $183 million in 2006, an increase of 38% from 2005. The increase in 2007 was mainly due to the $16 million of debt exchange expenses recorded in 2006, as there were no comparable charges in 2007. The increase in 2006 over 2005 primarily was attributable to higher interest rates and amounts invested. Our effective tax rates were 30.6% for 2007, 29.6% for 2006, and 30.2% for 2005. The effective rates for all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan, and research and development (R&D) tax credits. In addition, the rate for 2007 reflected a reduction in Income tax expense of $59 million related to the completion of an IRS audit in the first quarter. The rate for 2006 reflected a reduction in Income tax expense of $62 million related to a refund claim for additional extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI) benefits in prior years recognized in the third quarter of 2006. The rates in 2006 and 2005 also reflected tax benefits related to ETI. The increase in the 2007 effective tax rate when compared to 2006 is primarily the result of the elimination of the extraterritorial tax benefits in 2007, partially offset by additional tax benefits resulting from a statutory increase in U.S. manufacturing benefits, new legislation that provided enhanced R&D tax credits, and the favorable closure of an IRS audit. The small decrease in the 2006 tax rate when compared to 2005 is primarily the result of higher extraterritorial tax benefits in 2006 resulting from a refund claim for additional prior year benefits. Net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the sixth consecutive year. We reported Net earnings of $3.0 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2007, Net earnings of $2.5 billion ($5.80 per share) in 2006, and Net earnings of $1.8 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2005. Discussion of Business Segments In February 2007, we announced a realignment of our operations to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase our integration of resources. The realignment included the combination of our IT&GS and IS&S business segments into a new business segment named IS&GS, along with certain other changes. We now operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, systems integration, production, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, air vehicles and related technologies, primarily for U.S. and allied country military services. Combat aircraft programs include the F-35, F-22 and F-16 aircraft. The F-35 Lightning II is currently in the System Development and Demonstration phase and has entered low rate production. Aeronautics has been producing F-22 Raptors since 1997, and delivered 24 to the U.S. Air Force in 2007, bringing the total deliveries to 110. We also received a 60 aircraft multi-year contract for Production Lots 7, 8 and 9. A total of 41 F-16 Fighting Falcons were delivered in 2007 worldwide, bringing the total deliveries to 4,389. Sales at Aeronautics are expected to decline in 2008 primarily due to a projected reduction in F-16 activities. In the area of Air Mobility, we produce the C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. We delivered 12 aircraft in 2007. A total of 213 have been ordered and 159 delivered through 2007. In addition to aircraft production, the segment provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification and services for its aircraft. The Electronic Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research, development, integration, production and sustainment of high performance systems and subsystems for undersea, shipboard, land and airborne applications, including tactical missiles, surface ship and submarine combat systems, ground combat vehicle integration and radars, among others. With such a broad portfolio of products and services, many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. This business segment has continued to expand its core competencies 44 Table of Contents as a leading systems integrator. Some of its more significant programs, including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the VH-71 Presidential helicopter, the AEGIS weapon system and the Arrowhead fire control system for the Apache helicopter, demonstrate the diverse products and services Electronic Systems provides. The IS&GS business segment combines a full range of information competencies with a global delivery capability. The segment provides full life cycle support and expertise in the areas of software and systems engineering, including in space, air and ground systems, and provides logistics, mission operations support, peacekeeping and nation-building services for a wide variety of U.S. defense and civil government agencies. Key programs and activities include the Transformational Communications MILSATCOM Mission Operations Segment (TMOS) program, the FAA Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) program and a number of task order vehicles (indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts) in our Information Technology line of business. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies. The Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research, development, engineering and production of satellites for both government and commercial customers, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Through ownership interests in two joint ventures, the segment also includes Space Shuttle processing activities and expendable launch services for the U.S. Government. Government satellite programs include the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS). Strategic and missile defense programs include the Targets and Countermeasures Program and the Fleet Ballistic Missile program. Space transportation includes the NASA Orion program. In the following table of financial data, total Operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. The reconciling item “Unallocated Corporate expense, net” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see the discussion of “Postretirement Benefit Plans” under “Critical Accounting Policies”), costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. Since the activities of the investees in which certain business segments hold equity interests are closely aligned with the operations of those segments, the equity earnings (losses) from those investees are included in the Operating profit of the respective segments. This table shows Net sales and Operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. For all years presented, interest income has been reclassified from segment Operating profit and Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net to Other non-operating income (expense), net to conform to the 2007 consolidated Statement of Earnings presentation (see Note 1). In 2006, we reclassified $199 million, including $182 million from Unallocated Corporate expense, net and $17 million from across the business segments. In 2005, we reclassified $143 million, including $132 million from Unallocated Corporate expense, net and $11 million from across the business segments. The impact on the individual segments’ operating results was not material. In addition, we reclassified $16 million in expenses associated with the debt exchange in 2006 and $10 million related to a charge for the early repayment of debt in 2005, each from Unallocated Corporate expense, net to Other non-operating income (expense), net in the respective years. (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales Aeronautics $ 12,303 $ 12,188 $ 12,349 Electronic Systems 11,143 10,519 9,811 Information Systems & Global Services 10,213 8,990 8,233 Space Systems 8,203 7,923 6,820 Total $ 41,862 $ 39,620 $ 37,213 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,476 $ 1,221 $ 1,018 Electronic Systems 1,410 1,264 1,078 Information Systems & Global Services 949 804 720 Space Systems 856 742 605 Total business segments 4,691 4,031 3,421 Unallocated Corporate expense, net (164 ) (261 ) (568 ) Total $ 4,527 $ 3,770 $ 2,853 45 Table of Contents The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $76.7 billion and $75.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. This amount included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $42.3 billion at December 31, 2007. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Therefore, due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 15 to the financial statements. In our discussions of comparative results, changes in Net sales and Operating profit are generally expressed in terms of volume and/or performance. Volume refers to increases (or decreases) in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in Operating profit based on the estimated profit rate at completion for a particular contract for design, development and production activities. Changes in segment Operating profit are also expressed in terms of performance. Performance generally refers to changes in contract profit rates at completion. These changes on our contracts for products usually relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating or award fee performance on a particular contract. Changes in estimates of Net sales and Operating profit on contracts for products are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Segment Operating Profit (In millions) Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 12,303 $ 12,188 $ 12,349 Operating profit 1,476 1,221 1,018 Backlog at year-end 26,300 26,900 31,100 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 1% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in Net sales was due to growth in Other Aeronautics programs and Combat Aircraft, which were offset partially by declines in Air Mobility. Other Aeronautics programs increased $106 million primarily due to higher volume in sustainment services activities. Combat Aircraft sales increased $43 million mainly due to volume increases on the F-22 program that more than offset declines on F-16 programs. These increases were offset partially by a $34 million decline in Air Mobility sales due to lower volume on C-130 programs. Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 1% in 2006 compared to 2005. The anticipated decline in Net sales was due to a decline in Air Mobility sales that was offset partially by increases in Combat Aircraft and Other Aeronautics programs sales. 46 Table of Contents Air Mobility sales declined by $535 million primarily due to C-130J deliveries (12 in 2006 compared to 15 in 2005) and lower volume on the C-5 program. Combat Aircraft sales increased by $292 million mainly due to higher F-35 and F-22 volume, partially offset by reduced volume on F-16 programs. Other Aeronautics programs sales increased by $83 million primarily due to higher volume in sustainment services activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 21% in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating profit increases in Combat Aircraft more than offset decreases in Other Aeronautics programs and Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft operating profit increased $326 million mainly due to improved performance on F-22 and F-16 programs. Air Mobility and Other Aeronautics programs declined $77 million due to lower operating profit in support and sustainment activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 20% in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit increased in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft increased $114 million, mainly due to higher volume on the F-35 and F-22 programs, and improved performance on F-16 programs. The improvement for the year was also attributable in part to the fact that in 2005, operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the F-35 program. Air Mobility operating profit increased $84 million, mainly due to improved performance on C-130J sustainment activities in 2006. Backlog decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of sales volume on the F-35 program. This decrease was offset partially by increased orders on the F-22 and C-130J programs. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 11,143 $ 10,519 $ 9,811 Operating profit 1,410 1,264 1,078 Backlog at year-end 21,200 19,700 18,600 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 6% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales increased in Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC), Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2), and Platform, Training & Energy (PT&E). M&FC sales increased $258 million mainly due to higher volume in fire control systems and air defense programs, which more than offset declines in tactical missile programs. MS2 sales grew $254 million due to volume increases in undersea and radar systems activities that were offset partially by decreases in surface systems activities. PT&E sales increased $113 million, primarily due to higher volume in platform integration activities, which more than offset declines in distribution technology activities. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 7% in 2006 compared to 2005. Higher volume in platform integration activities led to increased sales of $329 million at PT&E. MS2 sales increased $267 million primarily due to surface systems activities. Air defense programs contributed to increased sales of $118 million at M&FC. Operating profit for the segment increased by 12% in 2007 compared to 2006, representing an increase in all three lines of business during the year. Operating profit increased $70 million at PT&E primarily due to higher volume and improved performance on platform integration activities. MS2 operating profit increased $32 million due to higher volume on undersea and tactical systems activities that more than offset lower volume on surface systems activities. At M&FC, operating profit increased $32 million due to higher volume in fire control systems and improved performance in tactical missile programs, which partially were offset by performance on certain international air defense programs in 2006. Operating profit for the segment increased by 17% in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit increased by $74 million at MS2 mainly due to higher volume on surface systems and undersea programs. PT&E operating profit increased $61 million mainly due to improved performance on distribution technology activities. Higher volume on air defense programs contributed to a $52 million increase in operating profit at M&FC. The increase in backlog during 2007 over 2006 resulted primarily from increased orders for certain tactical missile programs and fire control systems at M&FC and platform integration programs at PT&E. 47 Table of Contents Information Systems & Global Services Information Systems & Global Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 10,213 $ 8,990 $ 8,233 Operating profit 949 804 720 Backlog at year-end 11,800 10,500 9,200 Net sales for IS&GS increased by 14% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, sales increased in Global Services, Information Systems, and Mission Solutions. Global Services sales increased $609 million due to higher volume and growth in mission services activities including the impact of the acquisition of PAE in September 2006. Information Systems sales increased $401 million due to growth in information technology and the acquisition of MSD in February 2007. Higher volume in mission and combat support activities accounted for the majority of the $216 million sales increase at Mission Solutions. Net sales for IS&GS increased by 9% in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, sales increases in Global Services and Mission Solutions more than offset declines in Information Systems. Global Services sales increased $761 million primarily due to higher volume in mission services activities and the acquisition of PAE. Information Systems sales decreased $143 million primarily due to lower volume in information technology activities. At Mission Solutions, sales increased $140 million due to higher volume in global security solutions activities that more than offset declines in mission and combat support solutions. Operating profit for the segment increased by 18% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, operating profit increased in all three lines of business. Mission Solutions operating profit increased $90 million due to higher volume in mission and combat support solutions and aviation solutions activities. Global Services operating profit growth of $35 million was primarily attributable to the acquisition of PAE. Information Systems increased $34 million primarily due to improved performance of information technology activities and the acquisition of MSD. Operating profit for the segment increased by 12% in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, operating profit increased in all three lines of business. Higher volume in global security solutions activities accounted for the majority of the $41 million increase in operating profit at Mission Solutions. Information Systems operating profit increased $34 million mainly due to improved performance in information technology and systems integration activities. Operating profit increased $15 million in Global Services primarily due to the acquisition of PAE. The increase in backlog during 2007 over 2006 was due to increased orders in Mission Support activities and Information Systems programs. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 8,203 $ 7,923 $ 6,820 Operating profit 856 742 605 Backlog at year-end 17,400 18,800 15,900 Net sales for Space Systems increased 4% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, sales increases at Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) more than offset declines at Space Transportation. In Satellites, an increase of $354 million was mainly driven by higher volume in government satellite activities, while commercial satellites sales remained relatively flat. There were four commercial satellite deliveries during 2007 and five in 2006. Higher volume in strategic missile programs accounted for the majority of a $225 million increase in sales at S&DMS. Space Transportation sales declined $290 million. This decline was expected given the divestiture of the International Launch Services business and the formation of the ULA joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Corporation no longer records sales on Atlas launch vehicles and related support to the U.S. Government, as ULA is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This sales decline was offset partially by higher volume on the Orion program. Net sales for Space Systems increased by 16% in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, sales growth in Satellites and S&DMS offset declines in Space Transportation. The $1.1 billion growth in Satellites sales was mainly due to higher volume 48 Table of Contents on both government and commercial satellite programs. There were five commercial satellite deliveries in 2006 compared to no deliveries in 2005. Higher volume in both strategic missile programs accounted for the $114 million sales increase at S&DMS. In Space Transportation, sales declined $102 million primarily due to lower volume in government space transportation activities on the Titan and External Tank programs. Increased sales on the Atlas Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Launch capabilities (ELC) contract partially offset the lower government space transportation sales. Operating profit for the segment increased 15% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, operating profit growth in Satellites and S&DMS more than offset declines at Space Transportation. Satellites’ operating profit increased $90 million due to improved performance in commercial and government satellite activities. Increased operating profit of $33 million at S&DMS was due to higher volume and improved performance on strategic missile programs. In Space Transportation, the decline of $18 million in 2007 operating profit from 2006 was mainly due to a charge recognized by ULA in the third quarter of 2007 for an asset impairment on Delta II medium lift launch vehicles. The decline also reflects benefits recognized in 2006 from risk reduction activities, including the definitization of the ELC contract, and other performance improvements on the Atlas program, with no similar items recognized in the comparable period in 2007. Operating profit for the segment increased 23% in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit increased in Satellites, Space Transportation and S&DMS. The $69 million growth in Satellites operating profit was primarily driven by the volume and performance on government satellite programs and commercial satellite deliveries. In Space Transportation the $44 million growth in operating profit was attributable to improved performance on the Atlas program resulting from risk reduction activities, including the first quarter definitization of the ELC contract. In S&DMS, the $26 million increase was attributable to higher volume on strategic missile programs. Under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in LKEI and ILS in the fourth quarter of 2006, we continued to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not refund the advance. We expect to recognize the $67 million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires, which we generally believe will be in 2008 based on the expected Proton launch schedule, which is subject to change. Our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev) providing the contracted launch services or, in the event the launch services are not provided, ILS’ ability to refund the advance. Our Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007 included current assets relating to LKEI and ILS totaling $132 million and current liabilities totaling $189 million, both of which will be reduced as the launch services are provided. The assets primarily relate to advances we have made to Khrunichev, the manufacturer of the launch vehicles and provider of the launch services, for future launches, and the liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches. Any potential earnings impact resulting from our inability to realize the assets related to LKEI and ILS would be partially mitigated by our not recognizing the $67 million deferred net gain on the transaction. The decrease in backlog during 2007 as compared to 2006 was mainly due to sales volume related to government and commercial satellite programs, which more than offset increased orders on strategic missile programs. Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the components of Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net. (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (58 ) $ (275 ) $ (626 ) Items not considered in segment operating performance 71 230 173 Stock compensation expense (149 ) (111 ) — Other, net (28 ) (105 ) (115 ) $ (164 ) $ (261 ) $ (568 ) The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Because the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s Net sales and Cost of sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is not included in segment operating results and therefore is included in the reconciliation of total segment Operating profit to consolidated Operating profit under GAAP. 49 Table of Contents The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS expense, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 FAS 87 expense $ (687 ) $ (938 ) $ (1,124 ) Less: CAS expense and funding (629 ) (663 ) (498 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – expense $ (58 ) $ (275 ) $ (626 ) The FAS 87 expense decreased in 2007 due to an increase in the discount rate and other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets. FAS 87 expense decreased in 2006 primarily due to the reduction in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets in 2006, including contributions we made to the pension trust. CAS are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. The total funding requirement for pension plans under CAS in 2007 was $629 million, which was recorded in our segment results of operations. That amount was funded through discretionary prepayments we made to the plans in 2006. For 2008, we expect our funding requirements and expense under CAS to decrease. Also in 2008, funding in addition to the amount calculated under CAS will likely be required under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules. Any additional amounts computed under the IRC rules are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules, and are recorded on our Balance Sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we made discretionary prepayments of $335 million, $594 million and $980 million to the pension trust. Prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the CAS and IRC rules and, as a result, we expect to have no required cash contributions to the pension trust in 2008. Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. For example, gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by Corporate, as well as certain other Corporate activities, are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following items were included in Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net for 2007, 2006 and 2005: (In millions, except per share data) OperatingProfit (Loss) Net Earnings(Loss) Earnings (Loss) Per Share Year ended December 31, 2007 Gain on sale of interest in Comsat International $ 25 $ 16 $ 0.04 Gain on sale of land in California 25 16 0.04 Earnings from reversal of legal reserves due to settlement 21 14 0.03 $ 71 $ 46 $ 0.11 Year ended December 31, 2006 Gain on sale of interest in Inmarsat $ 127 $ 83 $ 0.19 Gains on sale of land 51 33 0.08 Earnings from expiration of AES transaction indemnification 29 19 0.04 Gain on sale of Space Imaging’s assets 23 15 0.03 $ 230 $ 150 $ 0.34 Year ended December 31, 2005 Gains related to Inmarsat transactions $ 126 $ 82 $ 0.18 Gain on sale of interest in Intelsat 47 31 0.07 Gain on sale of interest in NeuStar 30 19 0.04 Impairment charge related to a satellite (30 ) (19 ) (0.04 ) $ 173 $ 113 $ 0.25 The change in the “Other, net” component of Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net from 2006 to 2007 and from 2005 to 2006 primarily was due to lower expense associated with a number of corporate activities. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), made selective acquisitions of businesses, repurchased shares, increased our dividends and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt. The following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $458 million to $4.2 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $504 million and lower postretirement benefit plan contributions of $399 million as compared to 2006. This increase was offset partially by a $309 million decrease in cash provided by operating working capital and higher net tax payments of $272 million compared to 2006. Operating working capital accounts consist of Receivables, Inventories, Accounts payable, and Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.8 billion in 2006, an increase of $589 million compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Net earnings of $704 million, and also to an increase in operating working capital improvements of $150 million compared to 2005. The remaining change in cash between the periods was due to income tax payments, postretirement benefit plan contributions, and the timing of various other operating activities. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for Property, plant and equipment amounted to $940 million in 2007, $893 million in 2006 and $865 million in 2005. We expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed 2007 expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – We have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our strategic, operational and financial targets, help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth. As disclosed under the caption “Acquisition and Divestiture Activities,” we paid $337 million, including amounts related to acquisitions completed in prior years, for the acquisition of businesses and joint venture activities in 2007, compared with $1,122 million in 2006 and $564 million in 2005. In 2007, we received proceeds of $26 million from the sale of our remaining interest in Comsat International. During 2006, we received proceeds of $132 million from the sale of our remaining shares in Inmarsat, $24 million from the sale of assets of Space Imaging, LLC, and $24 million from the sale of Lockheed Martin Intersputnik. During 2005, we received proceeds of $935 million from the divestiture of non-core equity investments, including $752 million from the sale of our investment in Intelsat, Ltd., $140 million from the sale of Inmarsat shares and the redemption of certain Inmarsat equity-related investments, and $33 million from the sale of our NeuStar investment. 51 Table of Contents Financing Activities Share issuances, repurchases and dividends – Cash received from the issuance of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $350 million, $627 million and $406 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 7.1 million shares, 13.6 million shares and 9.7 million shares during the respective periods. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we used cash of $2,127 million, $2,115 million and $1,310 million for common share repurchase activity (see Note 10). Our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 128 million shares of our common stock from time-to-time at management’s discretion, including 20 million of additional shares our Board authorized for repurchase in 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we had repurchased a total of 95.3 million shares under the program, and there remained approximately 32.7 million shares that may be repurchased in the future. The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $615 million in 2007, $538 million in 2006 and $462 million in 2005. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years. We declared quarterly dividends: in 2007 of $0.35 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.42 per share for the last quarter; in 2006 of $0.30 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.35 per share for the last quarter; and in 2005 of $0.25 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.30 per share for the last quarter. Issuance and repayment of Long-term debt – Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our Long-term debt. In 2007, we repaid $32 million of Long-term debt based on scheduled maturities. During 2006, we paid $353 million to complete an exchange of debt and $210 million related to scheduled debt repayments. In 2005, we used $145 million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of Long-term debt. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2007, we held Cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.6 billion and Short-term investments of $333 million. Our Long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $4.4 billion. Our Long-term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures. We have $1.0 billion of convertible debentures that have a floating interest rate based on LIBOR; however, at December 31, 2007, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the debentures for a fixed interest rate. With this swap agreement, our entire Long-term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the $73.25 conversion price on our $1.0 billion of convertible debentures for the specified period of time, and therefore holders of the debentures may elect to convert them during the quarter ending March 31, 2008 (see Note 7). The right to convert the debentures based on our stock price is re-evaluated each quarter. We have irrevocably agreed to pay only cash in lieu of common stock for the accreted principal amount of the debentures relative to our conversion obligations, but have retained the right to satisfy the conversion obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash or common stock. The conversion obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount at December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $437 million. If that amount had been settled in shares on that date, we would have been required to issue 4.2 million shares of our common stock. We have the right to redeem any or all of the debentures at any time after August 15, 2008. We also have outstanding $300 million of 40-year debentures issued in 1996 that bear interest of 7.20%, the registered holders of which may elect, between March 1 and April 1, 2008, to have their debentures repaid on May 1, 2008. We have continued to classify these debentures and the $1.0 billion of convertible debentures discussed above as long-term based on our ability and intent to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year. Our ability to do so is demonstrated by our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2012 (see discussion below). There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility on December 31, 2007. In August 2006, we issued $1.1 billion of new 6.15% Notes due 2036 (the New Notes). The New Notes were issued in exchange for certain other of our then outstanding debt securities, and cash consideration of $343 million. Holders also received a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest on the previous notes. The cash consideration of $343 million, which is included in the Statement of Cash Flows in financing activities, is being amortized over the life of the New Notes as a discount using the effective interest method and recorded in interest expense. The New Notes are included on our Balance Sheet net of the unamortized discount under the caption Long-term debt, net. The expenses associated with the exchange, net of state income tax benefits, totaled $16 million and were recorded in Other non-operating income (expense), net. They reduced Net earnings in 2006 by $11 million ($0.03 per share). 52 Table of Contents Our Stockholders’ equity amounted to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $2.9 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to Net earnings of $3.0 billion, the remeasurement and recognition of prior period amounts related to our postretirement benefit plans under FAS 158 (see Note 12), which increased Other comprehensive income by $1.7 billion, and employee stock activity of $889 million. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of 21.6 million common shares for $2.1 billion and payment of $615 million of dividends during the year. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce Common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, Additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $471 million recorded as a reduction of Retained earnings. Through our debt repayment activities, our Long-term debt balance has declined $3.2 billion over the last five years from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2002. Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 31% at December 31, 2007, down from 39% at December 31, 2006. The decrease from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to the increase in Stockholders’ equity discussed above. Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio Return on invested capital (ROIC) improved by 220 basis points during 2007 to 21.4%. We define ROIC as Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (Stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting Stockholders’ equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans, including unrecognized prior service costs, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the adjustment for the adoption of FAS 158 in 2006 and minimum pension liability adjustments recorded in prior years. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to Net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Consolidated Financial Data – Five Year Summary on page 30 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. Return On Invested Capital Ratio At December 31, 2007, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2012. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured 53 Table of Contents and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate (as defined). Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion in debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. Our management continually reviews changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs, projected over the next three years. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2007, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt(a) $ 4,749 $ 104 $ 243 $ 2 $ 4,400 Interest payments(b) 4,945 308 512 492 3,633 Other liabilities 1,694 197 523 202 772 Operating lease obligations 1,104 295 419 268 122 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 26,051 15,309 9,432 1,017 293 Capital expenditures 256 242 11 1 2 Total contractual cash obligations $ 38,799 $ 16,455 $ 11,140 $ 1,982 $ 9,222 (a) The total amount of Long-term debt excludes unamortized discounts of $342 million (see Note 7). (b) Interest payments include amounts for debt outstanding through maturity except for our $1 billion of convertible debentures, for which we have included payments through August 15, 2008. Subsequent to that date, interest is no longer payable to holders, but rather will be included in the accreted principal of the debentures (see Note 7). Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Generally, our Long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Amounts related to Other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2007. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party. The amounts also include liabilities related to tax positions we have taken for which we have recorded liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (see Notes 1 and 8). We estimated the timing of payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities. 54 Table of Contents Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $25 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. However, the U.S. Government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” pursuant to the FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for its convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at several of our locations, related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial participation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. Offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have not been required to pay any such penalties. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $8.9 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, that extend through 2020. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2007 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Boeing each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and $200 million in other financial support to ULA, as required. The non-capital financial support was required to be made in the form of a revolving credit facility between us and ULA or guarantees of ULA financing with third parties, in either case, to the extent necessary for ULA to meet its working capital needs. We agreed to provide this support for at least five years from December 1, 2006, the closing date of the transaction, and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand. To satisfy our non-capital financial support commitment, we and Boeing have put into place a revolving credit agreement with ULA. At December 31, 2007, we had made $3 million in payments under our capital contribution commitment, and no amounts have been drawn on the revolving credit agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other related to certain financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain of its launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2007, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities. 55 Table of Contents We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts. In some cases, we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, as follows: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than1 Year (a) 1-3 Years (a) 3-5Years After 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 2,873 $ 2,651 $ 169 $ 45 $ 8 Surety bonds 423 378 45 — — Guarantees 32 1 30 1 — Total commitments $ 3,328 $ 3,030 $ 244 $ 46 $ 8 (a) Approximately $2,299 million, $36 million and $23 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “1-3 Year,” and “3-5 Year” periods, and approximately $44 million and $3 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” and “1-3 Year” periods, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $375 million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of Inventories, as Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as Other liabilities. Approximately $2.0 billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in LKEI and ILS (see Note 2), we will continue to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not refund the advance. We expect to recognize the $67 million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires, which we currently believe will be in 2008 based on the expected Proton launch schedule, which is subject to change. The amount we could be required to pay is expected to increase over time due to the payment of additional advances by the customers to ILS related to the specific launches we have guaranteed, and will be reduced by the occurrence of those launches. At December 31, 2007, the total amount that could be payable under the guarantees, approximating the total contract value of the guaranteed launches, was $174 million. That amount may be partially mitigated by approximately $57 million of cash we retained that, absent any requirements to make payments under the guarantees, will be paid to the buyer over time as the launches occur. Through December 31, 2007, Proton launch services provided through ILS were provided according to contract terms. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2007, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our $1.0 billion of convertible debentures based on LIBOR for a fixed interest rate through August 15, 2008. With this swap agreement, our Long-term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates. We have designated the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted LIBOR-based variable interest payments. Based on our evaluation at the inception of the hedging agreement and in subsequent periods, we expect the hedging relationship to be highly effective in achieving the offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged variable interest payments, resulting in a fixed net interest expense reported on the Statement of Earnings. We determined that the hedging relationship remained highly effective at December 31, 2007. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each Balance Sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to Other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was not material. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies, or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the 56 Table of Contents contracts are recognized in the current period. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding and the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended were not material. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 141(R), Business Combinations, which will become effective January 1, 2009. The new standard will replace existing guidance and significantly change accounting and reporting relative to business combinations in consolidated financial statements, including requirements to recognize acquisition-related transaction and post acquisition restructuring costs in our results of operations as incurred. FAS 141(R) will be effective for businesses acquired after the effective date. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, which is effective January 1, 2008, with the exception of leases and certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a market-based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The new standard generally is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. We currently do not expect that the adoption of FAS 157 will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which also becomes effective January 1, 2008. Under FAS 159, a company may choose to measure certain financial instruments (e.g., assets and liabilities) and certain other items not currently subject to fair value measurement at fair value. If so elected, any unrealized gains and losses from marking those items to market will be included in earnings in each subsequent reporting period. The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with few exceptions. We do not plan to elect the fair value option. In September 2007, the FASB issued a proposed rule that would change the accounting for our $1 billion of floating rate convertible debentures. The effect of the rule, if enacted as proposed, requires the proceeds from the debt issuance to be bifurcated between a debt and equity component as of the August 2003 issuance date. The equity component reflects the value of the conversion feature. The FASB currently plans to re-deliberate the proposal in the first quarter of 2008 and has not indicated when it may become effective. If approved as currently drafted, we would expect the proposed rule to result in immaterial changes to our previously reported Balance Sheets and Statements of Earnings to reflect the amortization of additional interest expense over the period from August 2003 to August 2008. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited (in some cases, only that of a passive equity holder) than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. 57 Table of Contents We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2007. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007. During 2007, we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on those activities and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. Management’s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 59. In addition, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 60. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk” beginning on page 56, and under the caption “Derivative financial instruments” in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies on page 69 of this Form 10-K. 58 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:31.166653
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Form 10-K includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and a five year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our Company and summarize some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year. Our Business Lockheed Martin is a global security company that principally is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, 84% of our net sales were made to the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor. Our U.S. Government sales were made to both Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD agencies. Of the remaining 16% of net sales, approximately 13% related to sales to foreign government customers (including foreign military sales funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), with the remainder attributable to commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and government information technology. We operate in four principal business segments: Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS), Aeronautics, and Space Systems. As a lead systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems (including integrated net-centric solutions), to missiles, aircraft, and spacecraft. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 33 through 59) – provides our management’s view about industry trends, risks, uncertainties, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations (including discussion of the key performance drivers of each of our business segments), our financial position, cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events, transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 60 through 62) include the following: • A report from management indicating our responsibility for financial reporting, the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting, including an assessment of the effectiveness of those controls; • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which includes their opinion on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP which includes their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. Financial statements (pages 63 through 66) – include our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Cash Flows and Stockholders’ Equity for each of the last three years, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Notes to the financial statements (pages 67 through 96) – provide insight into and are an integral part of our financial statements. The notes contain explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain of the captions on the financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies, and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 33 Table of Contents Highlights The financial section of our Form 10-K describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities, trends and uncertainties in our industry, and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Page 38 and page 68 Postretirement benefit plans Page 39 and page 82 Environmental matters Page 42, page 68 and page 91 Goodwill Page 43 and page 68 Stock-based compensation Page 43, page 70 and page 88 Discussion of business segments Page 45 and page 73 Liquidity and cash flows Page 51 and page 65 Capital structure and resources Page 53, page 64, page 66 and page 87 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 55 and page 90 Income taxes Page 70 and page 78 Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities In these times of unprecedented economic uncertainty and market turmoil, developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the faltering economy is at the forefront of the U.S. Government’s activities. We expect the new Obama Administration’s decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities, and the Congress’ reaction to the Administration’s proposals, to be balanced with the cost and impact of economic stimulus initiatives, particularly in the longer term. Spending priorities for fiscal year 2010 will be announced soon, with submission of a detailed President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2010 and beyond expected by late April or early May of 2009. Although we believe some priorities will change, many of the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most enduring national imperatives and critical mission areas. But the possibility remains that one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the Administration’s assessment of priorities. Department of Defense Business The Department of Defense (DoD) has, for the past eight years, focused on sustainment of current military capabilities and modernization of our Armed Forces to deter and defeat current and future threats. The prior Administration primarily sought to fund the U.S. military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations through supplemental funding requests. This supplemental funding enabled the DoD to proceed with critical recapitalization and modernization programs in the “base” budget, rather than using base budget funds available for those programs to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions and other unforeseen operations. While we expect to see continued support of such initiatives under the new Administration, other national priorities must also be addressed, most notably the current financial crisis. Initiatives to address economic stimulus will compete with other national priorities, such as defense and homeland security. In this period of transition, we expect the new Administration to look broadly across current programs and examine existing resources as part of its assessment of national priorities. Although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain, current indications are that overall defense spending will continue to increase over the next few years, albeit at lower rates of growth. The DoD base budget for fiscal year 2009 provided mid-single-digit growth above prior year levels. Current estimates for the budget for fiscal year 2010 provide for growth of about 2% to 3% over 2009 levels. The Administration’s assessment likely will include focus on the level and composition of supplemental budget requests going forward. Although Congress has continued to express concern about the size of supplemental budget requests, funding for ongoing operations has not been significantly curtailed by Congress to date. We expect to see continuing pressure to reduce supplemental funding requests. 34 Table of Contents We believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD. For example, the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cybersecurity, all appear to be national priorities. To meet these changing dynamics, we have been growing our portfolio of expertise, diversifying our business, and expanding systems integration skills into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, rotary wing aviation and land vehicles. We continue to produce the F-22 Raptor for the U.S. Air Force and will expand production of the C-130J Super Hercules tactical airlifter to meet U.S. Government and other demand. We also are preparing for increased production of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter for the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and international partners. In the areas of space-based intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the Global Positioning Satellite program (GPS III), TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-H), and classified programs. Our products are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air and space-based missile defense, including the Aegis Weapon System program, the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) program, and the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS). We continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and EQ-36 radar systems, to our warfighters. We are bringing our systems integration expertise, as well as our existing advanced technology products and services into adjacent military product lines, such as the Littoral Combat Ship, the VH-71 U.S. Presidential Helicopter, and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle programs. We also have unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. In the area of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs, our capabilities include the Air Operations Center Weapons System Integrator, the Airborne Maritime Fixed Joint Tactical Radio System, the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical, the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System, and the Global Communications Support System – Air Force. We are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the DoD. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost-effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers, and for improving global supply chain management. We also see opportunities to grow our business in providing global services and business process management for DoD needs. Despite the anticipated modest increase in the 2010 defense budget, we believe our revenue growth will exceed expected growth in the DoD budget. We expect strong expansion in our F-35 program as we begin low rate production activities and in sales of information technology solutions. We expect continued growth in our core and adjacent businesses for both domestic and international customers, as we broaden our portfolio and remain committed to excellence in execution. Our revenues have historically not been dependent on supplemental funding requests. Many of our programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles. There is always an inherent risk that these and other DoD programs could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs, either in the new Administration’s budget reviews or in the Congressional process of annual appropriations. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, Transportation and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Archives, and the Library of Congress. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the EPA, as well for the DoD. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance and enterprise solutions. The expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public/private competitions. In addition, recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. 35 Table of Contents Our recent experiences with non-DoD agencies have reinforced our strategy of becoming the world’s premier global security company. We have seen the global security environment becoming much more complex and dynamic. The very definition of security has continued to change. Over and above traditional military preparedness, we have seen and been a part of further expansion into more effective counter-terrorism and intelligence capabilities, international cooperation activities requiring more interoperable systems, and humanitarian, peace-keeping, and operational stabilization initiatives. Consistent with our DoD business, more affordable logistics and sustainment, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cybersecurity, all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. The continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. In addition, we may see an increase in demand from the Department of State and the United Nations for mission services, global security and stability operations, and facility services. We have made disciplined acquisitions and investments to reinforce our presence and skills in the information sciences domain. We believe expanded access to continuous high quality situational awareness will remain essential in assuring clarity and reducing uncertainty in today’s environment. The very need for this increased situational awareness will drive the linkage of increasingly robust communication systems, advanced sensing devices and the computers that control them. This capability will enable the meaningful sharing of information and networks will continue to grow in power and importance to accommodate these new linkages. We also believe the criticality of network security will result in increased demand for cybersecurity, and encryption security solutions. We expect to be well-positioned to meet these growing needs. The prior Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2009 sought to limit overall growth in the civil agency budgets to one percent per year or less. Similar to spending in the area of defense, civil programs will also have to compete with resource requirements for economic stimulus. Though we expect to see relatively small increases in total non-defense discretionary spending in the near term, we believe our key programs will continue to be supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business. Similar to the risks inherent in our defense business, funding for our civil agency business is contingent on approval in annual appropriations for each of the agencies with which we have business. Major programs may be funded over several annual government budget cycles, with the risk of future reductions or elimination in the new Administration’s budget review or in the annual Congressional appropriations process. In the civil government business, some risks are unique to particular programs. For example, although indemnification by the U.S. Government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses, U.S. Government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes. In addition, there are some instances where the U.S. Government could provide indemnification under applicable law, but elects not to do so. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. We generally seek, and in most cases have obtained, limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. SAFETY Act qualification is not available to mitigate potential liability for international applications of our homeland security products and services. Where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the SAFETY Act or choose not to do so, we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable or when emergency conditions relative to national security make qualification impractical. Other Business Considerations We are exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers, and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth and product failures can occur. In years in which an appropriations bill has not been signed into law before September 30 (the end of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year), Congress typically passes a continuing resolution that authorizes U.S. Government agencies to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. 36 Table of Contents During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our revenue and profit during the period. As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts, we believe the probability is remote that any of the claims, audits or investigations pending against us will have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We have entered into various joint ventures, teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business, and their activities are closely aligned with our operations. For example, we have a 50% equity interest in United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA), which provides the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches on Atlas and Delta launch vehicles, and a 50% equity interest in United Space Alliance, LLC (USA), which provides ground processing and other operational services to the Space Shuttle program. In some cases, we form joint ventures with one or more other contractors for the purpose of pursuing a bid for a particular contract and, if successful, the joint venture serves as the prime contractor under that contract. In those instances, the work under contract is performed by subcontractors to the joint venture including, but not limited to, the joint venture investors. We generally limit our exposure under these arrangements to our investment in the venture, which is typically not material, and to the performance of our obligations under the subcontract. In some cases, we guarantee contractual performance by the venture, but are generally cross-indemnified by the other venture participants to the extent of their contractual performance obligations. We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. Those customers, similar to our U.S. Government customers, have been affected by the global economic crisis. We expect their decisions regarding defense and security spending will also compete with their own economic stimulus initiatives. We conduct business with foreign governments primarily through Electronic Systems and Aeronautics. Our international sales are composed of “foreign military sales” through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. With regard to the Aegis Weapon System, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers (e.g., Japan, Spain, Korea, Norway, and Australia). This segment also was awarded two contracts by the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on Halifax class frigates and Iroquois class destroyers. Electronic Systems produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 25 countries, with 52 follow-on buys from 14 customers. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft’s international footprint with customers in nine countries including recent orders from India and Qatar. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for Norway’s P-3 fleet and the recent awards from the U.S. and Canadian Governments to upgrade their P-3 aircraft. IS&GS, through its subsidiary Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), has increased our presence in certain less developed countries by providing base camp construction, logistics, democratization and management services, among others, generally through our contracts with such customers as the United Nations and the U.S. Department of State. In addition, IS&GS was awarded the contract to provide all data processing for the population census in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the 2011 Census, including development of the related system. To the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries, other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control 37 Table of Contents regulations of the U. S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition Approximately 80% of our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development and production activities, which are accounted for under the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position (SOP) No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development or production activities. We account for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract. Accounting for Design, Development and Production Contracts Generally, we record long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price design, development and production contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As examples, we use this methodology for our F-22 Raptor program and the Aegis Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low rate of initial production units in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method as new contracts for different phases of a program are received after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales and an estimated profit. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter development and low-rate initial production contracts, and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under award and incentive fee contracts, is finally determined. Award fees and incentives related to performance on design, development and production contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the 38 Table of Contents work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. Products and services provided under long-term design, development and production contracts represent approximately 80% of our net sales for 2008. Therefore, the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design, development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point, our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately $225 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined. Accounting for Services Contracts Revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design, development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred, depending on the contract. The majority of our services contracts are in our IS&GS segment, including the Automated Flight Service Station contract to provide a network of air traffic facilities and related services, and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers contract to provide information management and technology services. Services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcing-type arrangements. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred, except that initial “set-up” costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement. Earnings related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and certain public relations activities are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 10). Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our postretirement benefit plans. This is 39 Table of Contents particularly true with expense or income for defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. Non-union represented employees hired after January 1, 2006 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan and our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation. We account for our defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), FAS 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, and FAS 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. FAS 158 requires us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or liability on our Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. FAS 87 and FAS 106 require that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make regarding financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The primary year-end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans; the rates of increase in future compensation levels for our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The more subjective of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider past and current market conditions, and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year as well as the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. These items include results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. The available universe of bonds is adjusted to reflect call provisions, outstanding issue amount, and bonds that are considered “outliers” (i.e. bonds with yields too far above or below the mean of the available universe of bonds). As of December 31, 2008, three actuarial models calculated rates of 6.15%, 6.18%, and 6.72% for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We also evaluated the annualized Merrill Lynch index for long-term AA corporate bonds (15+ years), which was 6.03% at the close of 2008. In general, these data points were 15 to 35 basis points lower than at December 31, 2007. The data we collect provides important inputs into our determination of an appropriate discount rate. After reviewing all of the above data, we determined that the most appropriate discount rate for Lockheed Martin as of December 31, 2008 would be between 6.00% and 6.375%. We selected 6.125% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2008, compared to 6.375% used at the end of 2007. The impact of the change in the discount rate, together with other factors such as the approximate (28)% actual return on plan assets resulting from downward market conditions in 2008, was a noncash, after-tax reduction to our stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2008 of approximately $7.25 billion. The negative return on plan assets accounted for over 90% of the decrease in stockholders’ equity. In addition, the negative return on plan assets in 2008 and the change in the discount rate will increase 2009 pension expense to approximately $1.04 billion, as compared to $462 million in 2008, with approximately 85% of the increase being driven by the negative return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 6.125% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2008, with all other assumptions held constant, would decrease or increase the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2008 by approximately $900 million, resulting in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $580 million. If the 6.125% discount rate at December 31, 2008 that was used to compute 2009 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2009 would be lower or higher by approximately $90 40 Table of Contents million. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated to assess other scenarios beyond the 25 basis points, because there is not a direct correlation between a change in the discount rate and the changes in stockholders’ equity and pension expense. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximated by the assumption; therefore, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future. At December 31, 2008, we concluded that 8.50% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2007. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore are recognized in our net sales. The total funding requirement for our qualified defined benefit pension plans under CAS was $590 million in 2008 which was recorded in our segments’ results of operations. For 2009, we expect our funding requirements under CAS to decrease slightly. Additional funding requirements computed under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules, as well as discretionary payments, are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules to the extent the amounts exceed CAS funding requirements. These amounts would be recorded on our Balance Sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we made discretionary prepayments of $109 million, $335 million and $594 million to the Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust) related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the CAS and IRC rules. The prepayments in prior years were used to fund required contributions in 2008. Based on our known requirements as of December 31, 2008, we would not expect to make any further required cash contributions to the Master Trust related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009 due to prepayments made in prior years. Due to other events which may occur in 2009, such as pending negotiations for certain collective bargaining agreements, we may decide to make cash contributions in 2009 of as much as $50 million to $100 million based on the outcome of those events. In addition, we may review options for using available cash for further discretionary contributions. The Master Trust primarily supports our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Valuation of the assets in the Master Trust requires judgment relative to the determination of fair value as of December 31. While many of the asset values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (e.g., stock of actively traded public companies), the trustee for the Master Trust uses various pricing sources to determine fair values for other assets where their value may be based on quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; or amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are based on active markets that can be observed (e.g., fixed income debt securities). For still other investments, values may be amounts derived from valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and which require the development of relevant assumptions (e.g., private equity funds and investments in real estate partnerships). The trustee uses brokers, pricing agents, and other pricing sources to assist in the determination of the value for many of the assets, and works closely with their providers to evaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the pricing data they receive. We review the trustee’s policies and procedures regarding pricing of investments, their selection of pricing sources, and the statements we receive from them, in our evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of the pricing data included in the statements. Given the current financial environment, we also assess the potential for adjustment to the fair value of certain investments where there is a lag in the availability of data to support the investment’s value (e.g., private equity funds and real estate partnerships). In those cases, we may solicit preliminary valuation updates at year-end from the funds and partnerships. We use that information, and corroborating data from public markets, to determine if any adjustments should be recorded in the fair values. At December 31, 2008, private equity funds and real estate partnerships represented approximately 10% of the total fair value of the Master Trust. In August 2006, the President signed into law legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public’s concern over the adequacy of such funding. The law had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the IRC that most companies are required to pay, beginning in 2008. The legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large U.S. defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding. The 41 Table of Contents legislation also requires the CAS Board to modify its pension accounting rules by 2010 to better align the recovery of pension contributions on U.S. Government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements. The new funding requirements for large U.S. defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of 2011 or the year in which the changes to the CAS rules are effective. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. We account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with SOP 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist, but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We record a liability for the amount within the range which we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or, in cases where no amount within the range is better than another, an amount at the low end of the range. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and assets in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements). At the end of 2008, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $809 million. We have recorded assets totaling $683 million at December 31, 2008 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental asset and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding assets would be increased by approximately $85 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities which we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as an asset with the remainder charged to operations. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible 42 Table of Contents parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill In accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which we generally define as the business segment level or one level below the business segment. We consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Our annual testing date is October 1. Performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, general market conditions, and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. Our goodwill at December 31, 2008 amounted to $9.5 billion. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2008 and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, a 25% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at October 1, 2008 would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge. Stock-Based Compensation We account for our stock-based compensation under the provisions of FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment. We recognize compensation cost related to all share-based payments, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options. Compensation cost for RSUs is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award. We estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our stock options do not include market or performance conditions. We generally recognize the compensation cost for RSUs and stock options ratably over a three-year vesting period. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining certain inputs to the model, including a volatility factor for our stock, an expected life of the option and a risk-free interest rate. We estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our daily stock price over the past five years, which is commensurate with the expected life of the options. We base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option, historical trends in employee exercise activity and post-vesting employment termination trends. We analyzed the option exercise patterns of our employees and determined there are no significant differences between employee groups. We base the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We also are required to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant which we base on historical experience. If any of our estimates or assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from the amount recorded in 2008. Compensation cost recognized in 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $155 million, $149 million, and $111 million. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of design, development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our Statement of Earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” section which follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for 2008, 2007 and 2006. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business, and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Electronic Systems, Aeronautics and Space Systems segments, while most of our services revenues are generated in our IS&GS segment. For 2008, net sales were $42.7 billion, a 2% increase over 2007. Net sales for 2007 were $41.9 billion, a 6% increase over 2006. Net sales increased during 2008 in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS segments but declined in Aeronautics primarily due to fewer combat aircraft deliveries and at Space Systems due to both government and commercial satellite activities. Net sales increased during 2007 in all segments as compared to 2006. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 84% of our net sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Other income (expense), net was $482 million for 2008 compared to $293 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings in affiliates, the recognition of the deferred gain from the 2006 sale of our ownership interest in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and earnings associated with reserves related to various land sales that were no longer required. Other income (expense), net was $293 million for 2007 compared to $336 million in 2006. This decrease primarily was due to gains recognized in 2006 from the sale of shares of Inmarsat and assets of Space Imaging, offset partially by increased equity earnings in affiliates in 2007. State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact on our operating profit of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this Form 10-K is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our operating profit for 2008 was $5.1 billion, an increase of 13% compared to 2007. Our operating profit for 2007 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 20% compared to 2006. Except for anticipated reductions at Aeronautics, operating profit increased in all business segments in 2008 as compared to 2007. Operating profit was favorably impacted by lower unallocated Corporate costs and the increase in other income (expense), net as discussed above. In 2007, operating profit increased across all business segments as compared to 2006 and was also favorably impacted by lower unallocated Corporate costs. Unallocated corporate costs in both 2008 and 2007 were favorably impacted by declines in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, primarily due to the decline in FAS 87 expense. Interest expense for 2008 was $341 million, or $11 million lower than 2007. This decrease mainly was driven by the August 2008 redemption of our $1 billion of floating rate convertible debentures, offset by interest expense on the $500 44 Table of Contents million of new debt issued in the first quarter of 2008. Interest expense for 2007 was $352 million, or $9 million lower than 2006. This decrease was mainly driven by lower interest expense associated with the September 2006 debt exchange. Other non-operating income (expense), net was an expense of $88 million in 2008 compared to income of $193 million in 2007 and income of $183 million in 2006. The decrease in 2008 primarily was due to net unrealized losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations and lower interest income on invested cash balances. The increase in 2007 mainly was due to the $16 million of debt exchange expenses recorded in 2006, as there were no comparable charges in 2007. Our effective income tax rates were 31.6% for 2008, 30.6% for 2007, and 29.6% for 2006. The effective rates for all periods were lower than the statutory rate of 35% due to tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, research and development (R&D) tax credits, and dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan. In addition, the rate for 2007 reflected a reduction in income tax expense of $59 million recorded in the first quarter of 2007 arising from the closure of the IRS examination of the 2003 and 2004 tax years. The rate for 2006 reflected a reduction in income tax expense of $62 million related to a refund claim for additional extraterritorial income (ETI) exclusion benefits in prior years recognized in the third quarter of 2006, and current year ETI tax benefits. The increase in the 2008 effective tax rate when compared to 2007 primarily is due to the $59 million benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in the 2007 effective tax rate when compared to 2006 primarily is the result of the elimination of the extraterritorial tax benefits in 2007, partially offset by additional tax benefits in 2007 resulting from a statutory increase in U.S. manufacturing benefits, new legislation that provided enhanced R&D tax credits and the favorable closure of an IRS audit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 signed by the President on October 3, 2008 retroactively extends the R&D tax credit for two years, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009, and increases the alternative simplified R&D credit rate from 12% to 14% for calendar year 2009. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit, which reduced our income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 by $36 million. Net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the sixth consecutive year. We reported net earnings of $3.2 billion ($7.86 per share) in 2008, $3.0 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2007, and $2.5 billion ($5.80 per share) in 2006. Both net earnings and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share has benefitted from the significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. The effect of those repurchases has been partially offset by common stock issued under our stock-based compensation and defined contribution plans. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in four principal business segments: Electronic Systems, IS&GS, Aeronautics and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Our Electronic Systems business segment manages complex programs and designs, develops, and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide. With such a broad portfolio of products and services, many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. This business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator both domestically and internationally. Some of its more significant programs, including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter, the Aegis Weapon System and the Arrowhead fire control system for the Apache helicopter, demonstrate the diverse products and services Electronic Systems provides. Our IS&GS business segment combines a full range of information competencies with a global delivery capability. The segment provides full life-cycle support and expertise in the areas of software and systems engineering, including space, air, and ground systems. It provides logistics, mission operations support, peacekeeping, and nation-building services for a wide variety of U.S. defense and civil government agencies. IS&GS’ key programs and activities include the Transformational Communications MILSATCOM Mission Operations Segment (TMOS) program, the FAA En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) program, the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program, the 2010 Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program, and a number of task order vehicles (indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts) in our Information Technology line of business. We expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies. Aeronautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related 45 Table of Contents technologies. Key Combat Aircraft programs include the F-35 Lightning II, F-22 Raptor, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft. The F-35 has completed the seventh year of development and has entered low rate initial production. Aeronautics has been producing F-22s since 1997, and delivered 23 to the U.S. Air Force in 2008, bringing the total deliveries to 133 through 2008. A total of 28 F-16s were delivered in 2008 worldwide, bringing the total deliveries to 4,417 through 2008. Key Air Mobility programs include the C-130J Super Hercules and the C-5 Super Galaxy. We delivered 12 C-130Js in 2008. A total of 257 C-130Js have been ordered with 171 delivered through 2008. In addition to aircraft production, Aeronautics provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification services for its aircraft. Sales at Aeronautics are expected to grow in 2009 primarily due to the projected increase in F-35 production activities and C-130J deliveries. Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Through ownership interests in two joint ventures, USA and ULA, the segment also includes Space Shuttle processing activities and expendable launch services for the U.S. Government. Government satellite programs include the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS). Strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program. Space transportation includes the NASA Orion program. In the following table of financial data, total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. Because the activities of the investees in which certain business segments hold equity interests are closely aligned with the operations of those segments, the equity earnings (losses) from those investees are included in the operating profit of the respective segments. The reconciling item “Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see the discussion in “Discussion of Business Segments” under “Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net”), costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net Sales Electronic Systems $ 11,620 $ 11,143 $ 10,519 Information Systems & Global Services 11,611 10,213 8,990 Aeronautics 11,473 12,303 12,188 Space Systems 8,027 8,203 7,923 Total $ 42,731 $ 41,862 $ 39,620 Operating Profit Electronic Systems $ 1,508 $ 1,410 $ 1,264 Information Systems & Global Services 1,076 949 804 Aeronautics 1,433 1,476 1,221 Space Systems 953 856 742 Total business segments 4,970 4,691 4,031 Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net 161 (164 ) (261 ) Total $ 5,131 $ 4,527 $ 3,770 The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $80.9 billion, $76.7 billion, and $75.9 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $51.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments generally focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 4 to the 46 Table of Contents financial statements. We have a number of programs that are classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. In our discussion of comparative results, changes in net sales and operating profit are generally expressed in terms of volume and/or performance. Volume refers to increases (or decreases) in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or services levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimated profit rate at completion for a particular contract for design, development and production activities. Performance generally refers to changes in contract profit booking rates. These changes on our contracts for products usually relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contracts that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating or award fee performance on a particular contract. Changes in contract profit booking rates on contracts for products are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Recognition of the inception-to-date adjustment in the current or prior periods may affect the comparison of segment operating results. Segment Operating Profit (In millions) Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 11,620 $ 11,143 $ 10,519 Operating profit 1,508 1,410 1,264 Backlog at year-end 22,500 21,200 19,700 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales increases in Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) and Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) more than offset a decline in Platform, Training & Energy (PT&E). M&FC sales increased $327 million mainly due to higher volume on fire control and tactical missile programs. MS2 sales grew $201 million primarily due to higher volume on surface systems, undersea systems and radar systems activities. The $51 million decline in PT&E mainly was due to lower volume on platform integration activities. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 6% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales increased in M&FC, MS2, and PT&E. M&FC sales increased $258 million mainly due to higher volume in fire control systems and air defense programs, which more than offset declines in tactical missile programs. MS2 sales grew $254 million due to volume increases in undersea and radar systems activities that were offset partially by decreases in surface systems activities. PT&E sales increased $113 million, primarily due to higher volume in platform integration activities, which more than offset declines in distribution technology activities. Operating profit for the segment increased by 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2008, operating profit increases at M&FC and MS2 more than offset a decrease at PT&E. Operating profit increased $82 million at M&FC mainly due to improved performance on air defense programs and higher volume on tactical missile and fire control programs. There was a $80 million increase at MS2, which mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on surface systems, undersea systems, and radar systems programs. PT&E’s operating profit declined $61 million primarily due to performance on platform integration activities. 47 Table of Contents Operating profit for the segment increased by 12% in 2007 compared to 2006, representing an increase in all three lines of business during the year. Operating profit increased $70 million at PT&E primarily due to higher volume and improved performance on platform integration activities. MS2 operating profit increased $32 million due to higher volume on undersea and tactical systems activities that more than offset lower volume on surface systems activities. At M&FC, operating profit increased $32 million due to higher volume in fire control systems and improved performance in tactical missile programs, which partially were offset by performance on certain international air defense programs in 2006. The increase in backlog during 2008 over 2007 resulted primarily from increased orders for platform integration programs at PT&E and for certain tactical missile programs and fire control systems at M&FC. The increase in backlog during 2007 over 2006 resulted primarily from increased orders for certain tactical missile programs and fire control systems at M&FC and platform integration programs at PT&E. Information Systems & Global Services Information Systems & Global Services’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 11,611 $ 10,213 $ 8,990 Operating profit 1,076 949 804 Backlog at year-end 13,300 11,800 10,500 Net sales for IS&GS increased by 14% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales increased in all three lines of business during the year. Global Services’ sales increased $568 million principally due to Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE) programs, mission services and other international activities. Mission Solutions’ sales increased by $444 million primarily due to mission and combat support solutions activities, as well as by transportation and security solutions. There was a $386 million increase in Information Systems, which mainly was due to higher volume on enterprise solutions and services activities. Net sales for IS&GS increased by 14% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, sales increased in Global Services, Information Systems, and Mission Solutions. Global Services sales increased $609 million due to higher volume and growth in mission services activities including the impact of the acquisition of PAE in September 2006. Information Systems sales increased $401 million due to growth in information technology and the acquisition of Management Systems Designers, Inc. (MSD) in February 2007. Higher volume in mission and combat support activities accounted for the majority of the $216 million sales increase at Mission Solutions. Operating profit for the segment increased by 13% in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit increased in all three lines of business during the year. Mission Solutions operating profit increased by $46 million due to higher volume and improved performance on transportation and security solutions programs, as well as mission and combat support solutions activities. Global Services operating profit increased $42 million primarily due to volume and improved performance on mission services programs and other international activities. In Information Systems, operating profit increased by $24 million due to higher volume on information technology programs and a benefit from a contract restructuring during the first quarter of 2008, which more than offset declines in mission services activities. Operating profit for the segment increased by 18% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, operating profit increased in all three lines of business. Mission Solutions operating profit increased $90 million due to higher volume in mission and combat support solutions and aviation solutions activities. Global Services operating profit growth of $35 million was primarily attributable to the acquisition of PAE. Information Systems increased $34 million primarily due to improved performance of information technology activities and the acquisition of MSD. The increase in backlog during 2008 over 2007 was due to increased orders in Mission Solutions activities and Global Services programs. The increase in backlog during 2007 over 2006 was due to increased orders in Mission Support activities and Information Systems programs. Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 11,473 $ 12,303 $ 12,188 Operating profit 1,433 1,476 1,221 Backlog at year-end 27,200 26,300 26,900 48 Table of Contents Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in net sales was due to decreases in Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility, which more than offset increases in Other Aeronautics Programs. Combat Aircraft sales declined $947 million due to lower volume on F-16, F-22 and F-35 programs. The $74 million decrease in Air Mobility primarily was due to lower volume on other air mobility programs. There were 12 C-130J deliveries in both 2008 and 2007. The $191 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was due to higher volume in sustainment services activities. Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 1% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net sales was due to growth in Other Aeronautics Programs and Combat Aircraft, which were offset partially by declines in Air Mobility. Other Aeronautics Programs increased $106 million primarily due to higher volume in sustainment services activities. Combat Aircraft sales increased $43 million mainly due to volume increases on the F-22 program that more than offset declines on F-16 programs. These increases were offset partially by a $34 million decline in Air Mobility sales due to lower volume on C-130 programs. Operating profit for the segment decreased 3% in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit declines in Combat Aircraft partially were offset by increases in Other Aeronautics Programs and Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, operating profit declined $86 million mainly due to lower volume on F-16 programs and lower volume and the decline in 2008 of the amount of favorable inception-to-date performance adjustments on the F-22 program. There was a $34 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs, which mainly was due to higher volume in sustainment services activities that partially was offset by a decrease in operating profit due to performance on a P-3 modification contract. In Air Mobility, operating profit increased $13 million mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on C-130 support activities, which more than offset a decline on C-5 programs. Operating profit for the segment increased 21% in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating profit increases in Combat Aircraft more than offset decreases in Other Aeronautics Programs and Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft operating profit increased $326 million mainly due to improved performance on F-22 and F-16 programs. Air Mobility and Other Aeronautics Programs declined $77 million due to lower operating profit in support and sustainment activities. Backlog increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to increased orders on the C-130J and F-35 programs, which were partially offset by declines resulting from sales volume on the F-22 program. Backlog decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of sales volume on the F-35 program. This decrease was offset partially by increased orders on the F-22 and C-130J programs. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 8,027 $ 8,203 $ 7,923 Operating profit 953 856 742 Backlog at year-end 17,900 17,400 18,800 Net sales for Space Systems decreased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales declines in Satellites partially were offset by growth in Space Transportation. In Satellites, sales declined $579 million due to lower volume in both commercial and government satellite activities. There were two commercial satellite deliveries during 2008, compared to four in 2007. Space Transportation sales increased $427 million primarily due to higher volume on the Orion program. Net sales for Space Systems increased 4% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, sales increases at Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) more than offset declines at Space Transportation. In Satellites, an increase of $354 million was mainly driven by higher volume in government satellite activities, while commercial satellites sales remained relatively flat. There were four commercial satellite deliveries during 2007 and five in 2006. Higher volume in strategic missile programs accounted for the majority of a $225 million increase in sales at S&DMS. Space Transportation sales declined $290 million. This decline was expected given the divestiture of the International Launch Services business and the formation of ULA in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Corporation no longer records sales on Atlas launch vehicles and related support to the U.S. Government, as ULA is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This sales decline was offset partially by higher volume on the Orion program. 49 Table of Contents Operating profit increased by 11% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating profit was due to Space Transportation, which partially was offset by a decline in Satellites. In Space Transportation, the $135 million increase mainly was attributable to higher equity earnings on the ULA joint venture, volume on the Orion program, and the results from successful negotiations of a terminated commercial launch service contract in the first quarter of 2008. The improvement in ULA’s earnings also reflects the absence in 2008 of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2007 for asset impairment on the Delta II medium lift launch vehicles. In Satellites, operating profit declined by $42 million during the year due to lower volume and performance on certain government satellite programs. Operating profit for the segment increased 15% in 2007 compared to 2006. During the year, operating profit growth in Satellites and S&DMS more than offset declines at Space Transportation. Satellites’ operating profit increased $90 million due to improved performance in commercial and government satellite activities. Increased operating profit of $33 million at S&DMS was due to higher volume and improved performance on strategic missile programs. In Space Transportation, the decline of $18 million in 2007 operating profit from 2006 was mainly due to a charge recognized by ULA in the third quarter of 2007 for an asset impairment on Delta II medium lift launch vehicles. The decline also reflects benefits recognized in 2006 from risk reduction activities, including the definitization of the ELC contract, and other performance improvements on the Atlas program, with no similar items recognized in the comparable period in 2007. The increase in backlog during 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased orders on government satellite programs and on the Orion program. The decrease in backlog during 2007 as compared to 2006 was mainly due to sales volume related to government and commercial satellite programs, which more than offset increased orders on strategic missile programs. Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the components of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net. (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ 128 $ (58 ) $ (275 ) Items not considered in segment operating performance 193 71 230 Stock compensation expense (155 ) (149 ) (111 ) Other, net (5 ) (28 ) (105 ) $ 161 $ (164 ) $ (261 ) The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS 87 and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Because the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales and cost of sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is not included in segment operating results and therefore is included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS expense, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 FAS 87 expense $ (462 ) $ (687 ) $ (938 ) Less: CAS expense and funding (590 ) (629 ) (663 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – income (expense) $ 128 $ (58 ) $ (275 ) The FAS 87 expense decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, and in 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in both periods was due to an increase in the discount rate and other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets at the respective plan measurement dates through December 31, 2007 (see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans”). Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. For example, gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by Corporate, as well as certain other Corporate activities, are not considered by management in evaluating the operating 50 Table of Contents performance of business segments. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following items were included in unallocated Corporate income (expense), net for 2008, 2007 and 2006: (In millions, except per share data) OperatingProfit Net Earnings EarningsPer Share Year ended December 31, 2008 Recognition of deferred gain on LKEI and ILS $ 108 $ 70 $ 0.17 Elimination of reserves associated with various land sales 85 56 0.14 $ 193 $ 126 $ 0.31 Year ended December 31, 2007 Gain on sale of interest in Comsat International $ 25 $ 16 $ 0.04 Gain on sale of land in California 25 16 0.04 Earnings from reversal of legal reserves due to settlement 21 14 0.03 $ 71 $ 46 $ 0.11 Year ended December 31, 2006 Gain on sale of interest in Inmarsat $ 127 $ 83 $ 0.19 Gains on sale of land 51 33 0.08 Earnings from expiration of AES transaction indemnification 29 19 0.04 Gain on sale of Space Imaging’s assets 23 15 0.03 $ 230 $ 150 $ 0.34 The change in the “Other, net” component of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net, between the periods primarily was due to lower expense associated with a number of Corporate activities. Liquidity and Cash Flows Current economic and market conditions have placed material constraints on the ability of many companies to access capital in the debt and equity markets. Over the past few years, we have generated strong cash flows, and generally have funded our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, retirement plan funding, and discretionary funding needs from our cash from operations. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed including the issuance of $500 million of debt securities in 2008. We also access the credit markets, as needed, to obtain letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes (e.g., guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts). At this time, our access to liquidity and capital resources generally has not been materially affected by the current credit environment. Our cash from operations continues to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditure needs. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, in the debt markets, the fees we pay under our credit facilities, or the cost or availability of providing letters of credit or other trade instruments to support our operating activities may be materially and adversely affected. We have financing resources available (see discussion under Capital Structure and Resources) to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary. Although credit from financial institutions is constrained, there are attractive interest rates available for credit worthy corporate issuers via the public debt markets. We believe that we have access to the credit markets, if needed for liquidity or general corporate purposes. We have encountered some instances in which financial institutions participating in our standby credit facilities have less credit capacity or are seeking to reduce their credit exposures generally. This may result in the need to identify additional financial institutions to participate in existing credit facilities. In addition, it may be more difficult to structure financing for future long-term project finance and joint venture activities, especially in international markets. Current market conditions raise increased concerns about counterparty risk. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk, as we engage in derivative transactions with financial institutions to hedge foreign currency exposures. In terms of supply chain management, our suppliers and subcontractors also may find it more difficult to access credit to support their operations. To date, we have not been materially adversely affected by counterparty credit defaults or subcontractor and supplier credit support difficulties. 51 Table of Contents In 2008, we repaid $1.1 billion in long-term debt, including the redemption of $1 billion in principal amount of our convertible debentures. Over the past decade, we have reduced our long-term debt by over $7.9 billion, from $11.5 billion at year end 1999 to $3.6 billion at year end 2008. Our currently scheduled debt maturities through 2012 total a relatively modest $245 million. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. For example, contracts may be cost reimbursable, time and materials, or fixed price. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts, which together represent approximately 65% of the revenues we recorded in 2008, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast to cost reimbursable contracts, for fixed price contracts, we generally do not bill until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our contracts may provide for performance-based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work. Fixed price contracts represented approximately 35% of the revenues we recorded in 2008. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2008 and those planned for 2009 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and information technology (IT). Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support low rate production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have several projects underway to modernize certain of our Space Systems facilities that are as much as 50 years old. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), made selective acquisitions of businesses, repurchased shares, increased our dividends, and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt. The following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $183 million to $4.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $184 million, lower postretirement benefit plan contributions of $429 million, and a $100 million dividend received from ULA. This increase was offset partially by a $291 million decrease in cash provided by working capital and higher net tax payments of $103 million compared to 2007. The decline in operating working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories on Combat Aircraft programs at Aeronautics and a decrease in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on various programs in the Missiles & Fire Control line of business at Electronic Systems. Operating working capital accounts consist of receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $458 million to $4.2 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of $504 million and lower postretirement benefit plan contributions of $399 million as compared to 2006. This increase was offset partially by a $309 million decrease in cash provided by operating working capital and higher net tax payments of $272 million compared to 2006. The decline in 52 Table of Contents operating working capital was primarily due to an increase in receivables on various programs in the Maritime Systems & Sensors line of business at Electronic Systems. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $926 million in 2008, $940 million in 2007, and $893 million in 2006. We expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed 2008 expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – We have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our strategic, operational and financial targets, help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth. As disclosed under the caption “Acquisition and Divestiture Activities,” we paid $233 million in 2008 for acquisition activities, including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, compared with $337 million in 2007 and $1,122 million in 2006. In 2007, we received proceeds of $26 million from the sale of our remaining interest in Comsat International. During 2006, we received proceeds of $132 million from the sale of our remaining shares in Inmarsat, $24 million from the sale of assets of Space Imaging, LLC, and $24 million from the sale of Lockheed Martin Intersputnik. Financing Activities Share issuances, repurchases and dividends – Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $250 million, $350 million, and $627 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 4.7 million shares, 7.1 million shares, and 13.6 million shares during the respective periods. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we used cash of $2,931 million, $2,127 million, and $2,115 million for common share repurchase activity (see Note 11). Our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 158 million shares of our common stock from time-to-time at management’s discretion, including 30 million of additional shares our Board authorized for repurchase in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 124.3 million shares under the program, and there remained approximately 33.7 million shares that may be repurchased in the future. The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $737 million in 2008, $615 million in 2007, and $538 million in 2006. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years. We declared quarterly dividends: in 2008 of $0.42 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.57 per share for the last quarter; in 2007 of $0.35 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.42 per share for the last quarter; and in 2006 of $0.30 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.35 per share for the last quarter. Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – In 2008 we issued $500 million of long-term notes due in 2013. The notes have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.12%. Cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long-term debt. In 2008, we paid a total of $1.0 billion representing the principal amount of our floating rate convertible debentures that were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed, and issued 5.0 million shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion obligations of $571 million in excess of the principal amount (see Note 9). We also paid another $103 million during 2008 related to other repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities, compared to $32 million in debt repayments in 2007. During 2006, we paid $353 million to complete an exchange of debt and $210 million related to scheduled debt repayments. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2008, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.2 billion and short-term investments of $61 million. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $3.6 billion. As of the end of 2008, our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes and debentures. In 2008, we issued $500 million of 4.12% notes due in 2013. In August 2008, all of our $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible debentures were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed consistent with our announcement of their planned redemption, and we issued 5.0 million shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion obligations of $571 million in excess of the principal amount (see Note 9). In August 2006, we issued $1.1 billion of 6.15% notes due 2036 (the Notes). The Notes were issued in exchange for certain other of our then outstanding debt securities, and cash consideration of $343 million. The cash consideration of $343 million is included in the Statement of Cash Flows in financing activities, and the Notes are included on our Balance Sheet 53 Table of Contents net of the unamortized discount under the caption “Long-term Debt, Net.” The expenses associated with the exchange, net of state income tax benefits, totaled $16 million and were recorded in other non-operating income (expense), net. They reduced net earnings in 2006 by $11 million ($0.03 per share). Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $6.9 billion from December 31, 2007. The decrease primarily was due to the annual remeasurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans at December 31 under FAS 158 (see Note 10), which increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $7.25 billion, the repurchase of 29 million common shares for $2.9 billion, and payment of $737 million of dividends during the year. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $3.2 billion and employee stock activity of $746 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $2.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. Through our debt repayment activities, our long-term debt balance has declined $2.4 billion over the last five years from $6.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 57% at December 31, 2008, up from 31% at December 31, 2007. The increase from 2007 to 2008 primarily was attributable to the decrease in stockholders’ equity associated with postretirement benefit plans discussed above. Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio Return on invested capital (ROIC) improved by 30 basis points during 2008 to 21.7%. We define ROIC as net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders’ equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations. We use ROIC as one of the inputs in our evaluation of multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Consolidated Financial Data – Five Year Summary on page 31 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. Return on Invested Capital Ratio 54 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in June 2012. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank defined Base Rate. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to our postretirement benefit plans. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. If we were to issue debt under this shelf registration, we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include repayment of debt, working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial, market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2008, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,145 $ 242 $ 2 $ 652 $ 3,249 Interest payments 4,729 286 533 516 3,394 Other liabilities 2,039 234 649 213 943 Operating lease obligations 1,096 262 407 262 165 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 21,424 12,843 7,321 1,181 79 Capital expenditures 239 206 33 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 33,672 $ 14,073 $ 8,945 $ 2,824 $ 7,830 (a) The total amount of long-term debt excludes the unamortized discount of $340 million (see Note 9). Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Interest payments include interest related to the outstanding debt through maturity. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2008. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of obligations for sites at which we are performing remediation activities, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party. The amounts also include liabilities related to tax positions we have taken for which we have recorded liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (see Notes 1 and 8). We estimated the timing of payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities. 55 Table of Contents Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $20 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. However, the U.S. Government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” pursuant to the FAR. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for its convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer. This would also be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. Offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $8.3 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, some of which extend through 2025. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2008 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and $200 million in other financial support to ULA, as required. The non-capital financial support was required to be made in the form of a revolving credit facility between us and ULA or guarantees of ULA financing with third parties, in either case, to the extent necessary for ULA to meet its working capital needs. We agreed to provide this support for at least five years from December 1, 2006, the closing date of the transaction, and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand. To satisfy our non-capital financial support commitment, we and Boeing have put into place a revolving credit agreement with ULA, under which no amounts have been drawn. At December 31, 2008, we and Boeing had made $3 million in payments under our capital contribution commitments, and we expect to contribute the remaining commitment of $22 million each to ULA in the first half of 2009. Prior to those contributions, we expect to receive a dividend from ULA in a like amount. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other related to certain financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain of its launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2008, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities. In 2008, we and Boeing received from ULA a dividend of $100 million each. Prior to distribution of the dividend, we, Boeing and ULA entered into an agreement whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources and/or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, amounts required for ULA to make such payments. Such capital contributions would not exceed the aggregate amount of dividends we received in 2008 and any others we may receive through June 1, 2009. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under this agreement. 56 Table of Contents We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts. In some cases, we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, as follows: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than 1 Year (a) 1-3Years (a) 3-5Years (a) After 5 Years (a) Standby letters of credit $ 2,680 $ 2,245 $ 350 $ 64 $ 21 Surety bonds 417 395 22 — — Guarantees 25 13 9 3 — Total commitments $ 3,122 $ 2,653 $ 381 $ 67 $ 21 (a) Approximately $2,157 million, $141 million, $23 million, and $5 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “1-3 Years,” “3-5 Years,” and “After 5 Years” periods, and approximately $42 million and $3 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” and “1-3 Years” periods, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $145 million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $1.8 billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Under the agreement to sell LKEI and ILS (see Note 14), we were responsible for refunding customer advances to certain customers if launch services were not provided and ILS did not refund the advances. Our responsibility to refund the advances expired upon the successful completion of the final launch, which occurred in November 2008. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this not only internally, through our independent research and development activities, but also through acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. Conversely, we may also explore the divestiture of businesses, investments and real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such assets, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are completed and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. Acquisitions We used approximately $233 million in 2008 for acquisition activities, including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates. Those activities included the acquisition of, among others, Eagle Group International, LLC, which provides logistics, information technology, training and healthcare services to the U.S. Department of Defense. We used approximately $337 million in 2007 for acquisition activities, including an additional contribution of $177 million related to our investment in ULA discussed below. Those activities also included the acquisition of, among others, Management Systems Designers, Inc., a provider of information technology (IT) and scientific solutions supporting government life science, national security, and other civil agency missions. We used approximately $1.1 billion in 2006 for acquisition activities including the acquisition of, among others, Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc., a provider of services to support military readiness, peacekeeping missions, nation-building activities, and disaster relief services. In each year, the amounts used for acquisitions included certain payments related to businesses acquired in prior years. We accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting, and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2008, 2007 or 2006. 57 Table of Contents Divestitures There were no divestiture activities in 2008. During 2007 and 2006, we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and real estate by divesting of the following: Year ended December 31, 2007 • Our remaining 20% interest in Comsat International, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share); and • Certain land in California, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share). Year ended December 31, 2006 • Our ownership interests in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS). The gain on the sale was deferred pending the disposition of guarantees associated with providing launch services for certain customers (see Note 14); • 21 million shares of Inmarsat plc, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $127 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $83 million ($0.19 per share); • The assets of Space Imaging, LLC, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $23 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $15 million ($0.03 per share); and • Certain land in California and Florida, which resulted in an aggregate gain, net of state income taxes, of $51 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $33 million ($0.08 per share). On December 1, 2006, we completed the formation of ULA with Boeing (see Note 14). As part of ULA’s formation, we contributed certain assets and liabilities related to our Atlas launch vehicle business. Our contribution, after completing working capital and conforming accounting adjustments and making an additional contribution of $177 million in 2007, totaled $367 million. We accounted for the transfer at net book value, with no gain or loss recognized. Our 50% ownership share of ULA’s net assets exceeded the book value of our investment by approximately $395 million, which we are recognizing ratably over 10 years as equity in net earnings (losses) of equity investees in other income (expense), net. Our investment in ULA totaled $428 million and $402 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business. We continue to closely monitor the market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the impact from any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. Our long-term debt portfolio bears interest at fixed rates. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments was approximately $4.8 billion, compared with a carrying value of $4.1 billion. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These foreign currency exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period. At December 31, 2008, the net fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding was an asset of $52 million (see Note 15). We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several credit line banks. We carefully monitor the amount of exposure we have with any given bank. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a Rabbi Trust which includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2008, investments in the Rabbi Trust totaled $500 million and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other assets. The Rabbi Trust holds investments in marketable equity securities that are exposed to price 58 Table of Contents changes and investments in fixed income securities that are exposed to changes in interest rates. Changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust are recognized in our earnings, in the caption “Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.” During 2008, we recorded net unrealized losses totaling $158 million related to the decrease in the value of the Rabbi Trust assets. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the Rabbi Trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized in the caption “Unallocated Corporate Costs.” The current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our Balance Sheet in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes, and the non-current portion of the liability is on our Balance Sheet in other liabilities. The resulting change in the value of the liabilities generally has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust. During 2008, we recorded earnings of $32 million related to the decrease in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There are a number of new accounting pronouncements and interpretations that will impact our financial statements and disclosures (see Note 1 under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”). We do not expect that any of those pronouncements or interpretations upon adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited (in some cases, only that of a passive equity holder) than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2008. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2008. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. During 2008, our management performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on those activities and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. Management’s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 60. In addition, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 61. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Section Roadmap The financial section of our Form 10-K includes management’s discussion and analysis, our consolidated financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and a five year summary of financial information. We have prepared the following summary, or “roadmap,” to assist in your review of the financial section. It is designed to give you an overview of our Company and summarize some of the more important activities and events that occurred during 2009. Our Business Lockheed Martin is a global security company that principally is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. Net sales to our U.S Government customer accounted for 85% of our total net sales in 2009 (84% in 2008 and 2007), either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor. Our U.S. Government sales were made to both Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD agencies. Of the remaining 15% of net sales in 2009, approximately 13% related to sales to foreign government customers (including foreign military sales funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), with the remainder attributable to commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and government information technology. We operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS), and Space Systems. As a systems integrator, our products and services range from electronics and information systems (including integrated net-centric solutions), to missiles, aircraft, and spacecraft. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Financial Section Overview The financial section includes the following: Management’s discussion and analysis, or MD&A (pages 26 through 53) – provides our management’s view about industry trends, risks, uncertainties, accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business, our results of operations (including discussion of the key performance drivers of each of our business segments), our financial position, cash flows, commitments and contingencies, important events, transactions that have occurred over the last three years, and forward-looking information, as appropriate. Reports related to the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (pages 54 through 56) – include the following: • A report from management indicating our responsibility for financial reporting, the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting, including an assessment of the effectiveness of those controls; • A report from Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which includes their opinion on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting; and • A report from Ernst & Young LLP which includes their opinion on the fair presentation of our financial statements based on their audits. Financial statements (pages 57 through 60) – include our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Cash Flows, and Stockholders’ Equity for each of the last three years, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of the last two years. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Notes to the financial statements (pages 61 through 90) – provide insight into, and are an integral part of, our financial statements. The notes contain explanations of our significant accounting policies, details about certain captions on the financial statements, information about significant events or transactions that have occurred, discussions about legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies, and selected financial information relating to our business segments. The notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 26 Table of Contents Highlights The financial section of our Form 10-K describes our ongoing operations, including discussions about particular lines of business or programs, our ability to finance our operating activities, and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations. We also discuss items that affected our results, which were not considered in senior management’s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments. We separately disclose these items to assist you in your evaluation of the overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company. We would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them: Topic Location(s) Critical accounting policies: Contract accounting/revenue recognition Page 31 and page 62 Postretirement benefit plans Page 33 and page 74 Environmental matters Page 35, page 62 and page 85 Goodwill Page 36 and page 61 Stock-based compensation Page 37, page 64 and page 81 Discussion of business segments Page 39 and page 66 Liquidity and cash flows Page 46 and page 59 Capital structure and resources Page 48, page 58, page 60 and page 81 Legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies Page 49 and page 84 Income taxes Page 64 and page 71 Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities The U.S. Government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The Administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities with the cost and impact of these economic stimulus initiatives, particularly in the longer term. Although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year, the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most enduring national imperatives and critical mission areas. But the possibility remains that one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the Administration’s assessment of priorities. The Administration’s spending priorities for next year were announced on February 1, 2010 with the submission of the President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2011. We are assessing those priorities, as well as potential Congressional reaction to the proposals in the budget request. On first review, all of our key priorities appear to be well supported in the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2011. One exception is the proposal to cancel the NASA Constellation program, which impacts the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle for which we are currently under contract. In addition, the President’s budget proposes a three-year spending freeze on specified non-DoD/civil agencies, and we are assessing the potential effect of that action on our non-DoD/civil agency programs and priorities. Every year, Congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the annual President’s budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which then require final Presidential approval. The outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business, both as a prime contractor and a subcontractor on programs specifically targeted for expansion, completion, or termination. Department of Defense Business The DoD base budget has seen consistent growth over the past ten years, enabling it to grow from $300 billion at the start of the last decade to almost $550 billion in the fiscal year 2011 President’s Budget Request. Within the base budget, investment funding, which includes procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), has grown from $104 billion in fiscal year 2001 to almost $190 billion in fiscal year 2011. As reflected in the fiscal year 2011 budget projections, overall defense spending is expected to continue to increase slightly over the next several years. The DoD base budget for fiscal year 2011 provided modest nominal growth above fiscal 27 Table of Contents year 2010, of 3.4%. Current estimates for the budget for fiscal year 2012 and beyond indicate that these will be about one percent real growth above the rate of inflation. On December 19, 2009, Congress completed action on the last of the fiscal year 2010 appropriations bills. With very few exceptions, our key programs were well supported in the appropriations bills. As we expected, Congress did not reverse the decisions to complete the F-22 Raptor program after delivery of 187 aircraft, cancel the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter (VH-71) program, terminate the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) program, and cancel the Transformational Satellite (TSAT) program. In June 2009, we received notification that the VH-71 contract was terminated for convenience. We also received notification in June that the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) contract, representing the ground support infrastructure for the TSAT program, was terminated for convenience. Funding for the additional four F-22 Raptor aircraft was approved by Congress, although we have not yet definitized the contract for that work. All remaining authorized work on the MKV program was completed in 2009, and no further work is expected to be authorized. Congress is just beginning its review of the fiscal year 2011 budget, and we are in the process of assessing the potential effect of the President’s fiscal year 2011 budget proposal on our future operations. The fiscal year 2011 budget proposal provides more than $11.7 billion to fund development activities and the production of 43 F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters. Substantial funding is also requested for the C-130J tactical airlifter, C-5M modernization, Aegis Weapons System continuation, and the Littoral Combat Ship. The Administration has proposed, and Congress thus far has agreed, to fund U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations, through a separate Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding outside of the base DoD budget. Congress approved nearly $130 billion for OCO funding in the fiscal year 2010 appropriations bill, and the Administration has requested $165 billion in the fiscal year 2011 budget request. This contingency funding enables DoD to proceed with critical recapitalization and modernization programs in the base budget, rather than diverting funds available for modernization to pay for the Afghanistan and Iraq missions and other unforeseen operations. Depending on the status of ongoing contingencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Administration will assess the level and composition of overseas contingency budget requests going forward. Although Congress has continued to express concern about the size of budget requests for Afghanistan and Iraq, funding for ongoing operations has not been significantly curtailed by Congress to date, and these requests are expected to decrease in size as U.S. troops redeploy from Iraq as planned over the next eighteen months. The recently released fiscal year 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) validates the Pentagon’s April 2009 decisions on program focus, budget priorities, and the preeminence of ensuring success in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon stated that “the fiscal year 2010 defense budget represented a down payment on re-balancing the department’s priorities in keeping with the lessons learned and capabilities gained from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those shifts are continued in the fiscal year 2011 budget and institutionalized in this QDR and out-year budget plan.” As a result of adjustments that were made earlier in the year, new program terminations were largely absent in the QDR. Overall, Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), Long Range Strike, international cooperation, and partner capacity were emphasized, each of which are strengths for us. Additionally, the increased role of 5th generation aircraft and the F-35 received QDR endorsement, as well as expanding the AC-130 fleet, increasing UAV capabilities, experimenting with conventional prompt global strike prototypes, and forces being enabled and enhanced by cyberspace, space, ballistic missile defense, and counter-weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities. While the need for acquisition reform is also addressed in the QDR, most of the focus areas addressed are already under discussion between industry and the Department. In 2009, legislation was enacted on a number of acquisition reform initiatives resulting in new acquisition policies and procedures. In addition, as the U.S. Government seeks to clarify its overall policy regarding contractor performance of certain governmental functions, we are monitoring related pending regulatory actions regarding mitigation of potential organizational conflicts of interest that may impact our business in the future. We believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD. For example, the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cybersecurity, all appear to be national priorities. To meet these changing dynamics, we have been growing our portfolio of expertise, diversifying our business, and expanding systems integration skills into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, rotary wing aviation and land vehicles. We are expanding production of the C-130J Super Hercules tactical airlifter to meet the needs of the U.S. Government and international customers. We also are preparing for increased production of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter for 28 Table of Contents the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and international partners. We view this program as a significant element of a broader U.S. effort to build the capacity of alliance partners throughout the world. In the areas of space-based intelligence and information superiority, we have leadership positions on programs such as the Global Positioning Satellite program, Mobile User Objective System, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system, the Space-Based Infrared System-High, and classified programs. Our products are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air, and space-based missile defense, including the Aegis Weapon System program, the Patriot Advanced Capability missile program, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, and the Medium Extended Air Defense System. We continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and EQ-36 radar systems, to our warfighters. We are bringing our systems integration expertise, as well as our existing advanced technology products and services, into adjacent military product lines, such as the Littoral Combat Ship and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle programs. We also have unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. In the area of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs, our capabilities include the Air Operations Center Weapons System Integrator, the Airborne Maritime Fixed Joint Tactical Radio System, the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical, the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System, and the Global Communications Support System – Air Force. We have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the DoD’s information technology systems. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost-effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers, and for improving global supply chain management. We also see opportunities to grow our business in providing global services and business process management for DoD needs. To date, we have seen no significant impact on our business from implementation of the DoD policy to increase its staffing levels and move work scope currently performed by private contractors back to U.S. Government employees. Over time, however, this work scope realignment has the potential to reduce the level of work performed by outside contractors, including work on certain of our programs. We believe revenue growth in our defense business will match or exceed expected growth in the DoD budget in fiscal year 2011. We expect continued growth in our core and adjacent businesses for both domestic and international customers, as we broaden our portfolio and remain committed to excellence in execution. Our revenues have historically not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests. Many of our programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles. There is always an inherent risk that these and other DoD programs could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs, either in the Administration’s budget reviews or in the Congressional process of annual appropriations. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, Transportation, and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Archives, and the Library of Congress. The Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2011 proposes less than one percent nominal growth in civil agency budgets compared to fiscal year 2010. In addition, the President’s budget proposes a three-year freeze in certain civil agency budgets. Both of these proposals must be reviewed by Congress and will be subject to final Congressional approval in the appropriations process. Civil programs must continue to compete with resource requirements for security, economic stimulus, and deficit management. Though we expect to see relatively small increases in total non-defense discretionary spending in the near term, we believe our key programs will continue to be supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business. As previously disclosed, one exception is the proposed cancellation of the program that includes the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle for which we are currently under contract. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the EPA, as well for the DoD. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance, and enterprise solutions. In the civil arena, we also have not seen significant impact 29 Table of Contents on our business from the Administration’s stated policy of returning certain work to U.S. Government employees, known as “in-sourcing”. We believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions. As a result, we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies. Our recent experiences with non-DoD agencies have reinforced our strategy of becoming the world’s premier global security company. We have seen the global security environment becoming much more complex and dynamic. The very definition of security has continued to change. Over and above traditional military preparedness, we have seen and been a part of further expansion into more effective counter-terrorism and intelligence capabilities, international cooperation activities requiring more interoperable systems, and humanitarian, peacekeeping, and operational stabilization initiatives. Consistent with our DoD business, more affordable logistics and sustainment, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cybersecurity all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. The continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. In addition, we may see an increase in demand from the Department of State and the United Nations for mission services, global security and stability operations, and facility services. We have made disciplined acquisitions and investments to reinforce our presence and skills in the information sciences domain. We believe expanded access to continuous high quality situational awareness will remain essential in assuring clarity and reducing uncertainty in today’s environment. The very need for this increased situational awareness will drive the linkage of increasingly robust communication systems, advanced sensing devices and the computers that control them. This capability will enable the meaningful sharing of information, and networks will continue to grow in power and importance to accommodate these new linkages. We also believe the criticality of network security will result in increased demand for cybersecurity and encryption security solutions. We expect to be well-positioned to meet these growing needs. Similar to the risks inherent in our defense business, funding for our civil agency business is contingent on approval in annual appropriations for each of the agencies with which we have business. Major programs may be funded over several annual government budget cycles, with the risk of future reductions or elimination in the Administration’s budget review or in the annual Congressional appropriations process. Other Business Considerations We are exposed to risks associated with U.S. Government contracting, including technological uncertainties, dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers, and obsolescence, as well as Congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year. Many of our programs involve the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result, setbacks, delays, cost growth, and product failures can occur. In years that an appropriations bill has not been signed into law before September 30 (the end of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year), Congress typically passes a continuing resolution that authorizes U.S. Government agencies to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our revenue and profit during the period. As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the U.S. Government could make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty, based on current facts we believe the probability is remote that any of the claims, audits, or investigations pending against us will have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. 30 Table of Contents We have entered into various joint ventures, teaming agreements, and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business, and their activities are closely aligned with our operations. For example, we have a 50% equity interest in United Launch Alliance, L.L.C. (ULA), which provides the production, engineering, test, and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches on Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. In some cases, we form joint ventures with one or more other contractors for the purpose of pursuing a bid for a particular contract and, if successful, the joint venture serves as the prime contractor under that contract. In those instances, the work under contract is sometimes performed by subcontractors to the joint venture including, but not limited to, the joint venture investors. We attempt to limit our exposure under these arrangements to our investment in the joint venture, which is typically not material, and to the performance of our obligations under the subcontract. While we may in some cases guarantee contractual performance by the joint venture, we are usually cross-indemnified by the other joint venture participants to the extent of their contractual performance obligations. We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. We conduct business with foreign governments primarily through Aeronautics and Electronic Systems. Our international sales are composed of “foreign military sales” through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II. We expect international deliveries to begin in 2011. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 25 countries, with 52 follow-on buys from 14 countries. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft’s international footprint with customers in 11 countries including recent orders from India and Qatar. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for Norway’s P-3 fleet and the recent awards from the U.S. and Canadian Governments to upgrade their P-3 aircraft. With regard to the Aegis Weapon System, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers (e.g., Japan, Spain, Korea, Norway, and Australia). This segment has two contracts with the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on Halifax class frigates and Iroquois class destroyers. Electronic Systems also produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). IS&GS, through its subsidiary Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), continues to increase our presence in certain less developed countries by providing base camp construction, logistics, democratization and management services, among others, through our contracts with such customers as the United Nations and the U.S. Department of State. In addition, IS&GS is providing all data processing for the 2011 population census in England and Wales, including development of the related system. To the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries, other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries, and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations. The nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the U. S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. If these regulations are violated, it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. We are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Revenue Recognition Approximately 80% of our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development, and production activities (also referred to as DD&P contracts). Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development, or production activities. We consider the nature of our contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Design, Development, and Production Contracts For long-term, fixed-price DD&P contracts that, among other factors, require us to provide a number of similar items produced in a stable production environment, we record sales on a percentage of completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For example, we use this method of revenue recognition on our C-130J tactical transport aircraft program and Multiple Launch Rocket System program. For certain other long-term, fixed-price DD&P contracts that, along with other factors, require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion. As an example, we use this methodology for our Aegis Weapon System program. In some instances, long-term production programs may require a significant level of development and/or a low rate of initial production in their early phases, but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later, full-rate production stages. In those cases, the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost-to-cost method to the units-of-delivery method as new contracts for different phases of a program are received after considering, among other factors, program and production stability. As we incur costs under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, we record sales and an estimated profit. Cost-reimbursement-type contracts include time and materials and other level-of-effort-type contracts. Examples of this type of revenue recognition include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter development and low-rate initial production contracts, and the THAAD missile defense program. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government (i.e., foreign military sales). As a general rule, we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost-to-cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units-of-delivery method. In addition, our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under award and incentive fee contracts, is finally determined. Award fees and incentives related to performance on DD&P contracts, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Accounting for DD&P contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. For contract change orders, claims, or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. Products and services provided under long-term DD&P contracts represented approximately 80% of our net sales for 2009. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all DD&P contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2009 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $235 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined. 32 Table of Contents Accounting for Services Contracts Revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design, development, or production activities is recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred, depending on the contract. The majority of our services contracts are in our IS&GS segment, including the Automated Flight Service Station contract to provide a network of air traffic facilities and related services, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contract to provide information management and technology services. Services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcing-type arrangements. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred, except that initial “set-up” costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement. Earnings related to services contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling, and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Sales and earnings” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 10). Our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our postretirement benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense or income for defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. Non-union represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in our qualified defined contribution plan and our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. In accordance with the rules related to postretirement benefit plans under GAAP, we recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or liability on our Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record, including the expense or income for the plans, be computed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include many assumptions, including assumptions we make regarding financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use. The primary year-end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense or income for the following calendar year 33 Table of Contents are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans; the rates of increase in future compensation levels for our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. We use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider past and current market conditions, and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. These items include results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. The available universe of bonds is adjusted to reflect call provisions, outstanding issue amount, and bonds that are considered “outliers” (i.e., bonds with yields significantly above or below the mean of the available universe of bonds). As of December 31, 2009, three actuarial models calculated rates of 5.82%, 5.94%, and 5.89% for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We also evaluated the annualized Merrill Lynch index for long-term AA corporate bonds (15+ years), which was 6.04% at the close of 2009. On average, these data points were 25 basis points lower than at December 31, 2008. After reviewing all of the above data, we selected 5.875% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2009, compared to 6.125% used at the end of 2008. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximated by the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future. At December 31, 2009, we concluded that 8.50% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2008. The impact of the change in the discount rate, together with other factors such as the approximate 20% actual return on plan assets resulting from improved market conditions in 2009, was a noncash, after-tax increase to our stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2009 of approximately $495 million. The increase primarily resulted from the excess of our actual return on plan assets over our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption, which partially was offset by the effects of the decrease in the discount rate. The 2010 pension expense will be approximately $1.4 billion, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2009. The increase in 2010 pension expense is due to the decrease in the discount rate and the continued amortization of the actuarial losses incurred in 2008, which resulted from the significant negative return on plan assets compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption. The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.875% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2009, with all other assumptions held constant, would decrease or increase the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2009 by approximately $1.0 billion, resulting in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $650 million. If the 5.875% discount rate at December 31, 2009 that was used to compute 2010 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2010 would be lower or higher by approximately $95 million. Valuation of Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets Valuation of the assets held in a number of trusts to support our postretirement benefit plans requires judgment relative to the determination of fair value as of December 31. While many of the asset values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (e.g., stock of actively traded public companies), the trustees for the trusts use various pricing sources to determine fair values for other assets where their value may be based on quoted prices for similar instruments or 34 Table of Contents quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; or amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are based on active markets that can be observed (e.g., fixed income debt securities). For still other investments, values may be derived from valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and that require the development of relevant assumptions (e.g., investments in private equity funds and real estate funds). For these assets, fair values are determined by the general partners of the funds or independent administrators, typically using both income and market approaches in their valuation models. The funds are also audited by independent auditors annually. We review the trustees’ policies and procedures regarding pricing of investments, their selection of pricing sources, and the statements and supporting documentation we receive from them, in our evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of the pricing data included in the statements. We also assess the potential for adjustment to the fair value of certain investments where there is a lag in the availability of data to support the investment’s value (e.g., private equity funds and investments in real estate partnerships). In those cases, we may solicit preliminary valuation updates at year-end from the funds and partnerships. We use that information, and corroborating data from public markets, to determine if any adjustments should be recorded in the fair values. At December 31, 2009, these types of investments represented approximately 11% of the total fair value of the postretirement benefit plan assets. Other Considerations U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are a major factor we consider in determining our total pension funding and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and are recognized in our net sales. The amount of funding required under CAS for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for 2009, and therefore the amount included in our segments’ operating results for the year, was $580 million. For 2010, we expect the funding required under CAS will be about $1.0 billion. Additional funding requirements computed under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules, as well as discretionary payments, are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules to the extent the amounts exceed CAS funding requirements. These amounts would be recorded on our Balance Sheet and recovered in future periods. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we made discretionary contributions of $1,482 million, $109 million, and $335 million related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Based on our known requirements as of December 31, 2009, including consideration of the discretionary contribution made in 2009, no contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are expected to be required in 2010. We do expect to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, as we anticipate that funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act (see discussion below) beginning in 2011 will be higher than requirements in previous years. We also may review options for further contributions in 2010. We anticipate recovering approximately $1.0 billion as CAS cost during 2010, with the remainder being recoverable in future years. In August 2006, legislation was enacted related to pension plan funding, known as the Pension Protection Act, in response to the public’s concern over the adequacy of such funding. The law had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the IRC that most companies are required to pay, beginning in 2008. The legislation provided an exemption for us, as well as other large U.S. defense contractors, that delayed the requirement to accelerate funding. The legislation also requires the CAS Board to modify its pension accounting rules by 2010 to better align the recovery of pension contributions on U.S. Government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements. The new funding requirements for large U.S. defense contractors have been delayed until the earlier of 2011 or the year in which the changes to the CAS rules are effective. We currently expect that the pension reform funding provisions will impact us and other large U.S. defense contractors in 2011. The CAS Board has not published changes to its pension accounting rules as of December 31, 2009. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities 35 Table of Contents usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We record a liability for the amount within the range that we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or, in cases where no amount within the range is better than another, an amount at the low end of the range. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and assets in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements). At the end of 2009, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $877 million. We have recorded assets totaling $740 million at December 31, 2009 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental asset and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding assets would be increased by approximately $85 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as an asset with the remainder charged to operations. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. Our annual testing date is October 1. 36 Table of Contents Performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value. We consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires significant judgment. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. Our goodwill at December 31, 2009 amounted to $9.9 billion. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2009 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and, as such, no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, a 25% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at October 1, 2009 would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge. We currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost related to all share-based payments, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options. Compensation cost for RSUs is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award. We estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our stock options do not include market or performance conditions. We generally recognize the compensation cost for RSUs and stock options ratably over a three-year vesting period. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining certain inputs to the model, including a volatility factor for our stock, an expected life of the option, and a risk-free interest rate. We estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our daily stock price over the past five years, which is commensurate with the expected life of the options. We base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option, historical trends in option exercise activity, and post-vesting employment termination trends. We analyzed the option exercise patterns of our employees and determined there are no significant differences between employee groups. We base the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We also are required to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant, which we base on historical experience. If any of our estimates or assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from the amount recorded in 2009. Compensation cost recognized in 2009, 2008, and 2007 totaled $154 million, $155 million, and $149 million. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of DD&P contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. Net Sales (In billions) The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our Statement of Earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business, and focus the discussion of our results of operations around major products and lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, and Space Systems segments, while most of our services revenues are generated in our IS&GS segment. For 2009, net sales were $45.2 billion, a 6% increase over 2008. Net sales for 2008 were $42.7 billion, a 2% increase over 2007. Net sales increased during 2009 in all segments as compared to 2008. Net sales increased during 2008 compared to 2007 in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS segments but declined in Aeronautics primarily due to fewer combat aircraft deliveries and, at Space Systems, due to both government and commercial satellite activities. The U.S. Government is our largest customer, accounting for about 85% of our net sales in 2009 and about 84% in 2008 and 2007. Other income (expense), net was $242 million for 2009 compared to $482 million in 2008. This decrease primarily was due to the recognition of a deferred gain of $108 million in 2008 from the sale of our ownership interest in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS) in 2006; earnings of $85 million recorded in 2008 associated with reserves related to various land sales that were no longer required; and a loss of $24 million on the 2009 sale of a foreign subsidiary. Other income (expense), net was $482 million for 2008 compared to $293 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due to an additional $86 million in equity earnings in affiliates in 2008 compared to 2007, the recognition of the LKEI and ILS deferred gain in 2008, and the earnings associated with the elimination of reserves related to various land sales in 2008. State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact on our operating profit of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this Form 10-K is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our operating profit for 2009 was $4.5 billion, a decrease of 13% compared to 2008. Our operating profit for 2008 was $5.1 billion, an increase of 13% compared to 2007. In 2009, operating profit was negatively impacted by higher unallocated Corporate costs and the decrease in other income (expense), net as discussed above. These declines more than offset increased operating profit at the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems and Space Systems business segments. The higher unallocated Corporate costs in 2009 mainly were attributable to the impact of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, which resulted in expense in 2009 of $456 million as compared to income in 2008 of $128 million due to the negative actual return on plan assets in 2008 and a lower discount rate at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Except for reductions at Aeronautics, operating profit increased in all business segments in 2008 as compared to 2007. Operating profit in 2008 was favorably impacted by lower unallocated Corporate costs and the increase in other income (expense), net as discussed above. Unallocated Corporate costs in 2008 were favorably impacted by declines in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, primarily due to the decline in FAS pension expense. 38 Table of Contents Interest expense for 2009 was $305 million, or $36 million lower than 2008. The decrease mainly was driven by the August 2008 redemption of our $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible debentures, partially offset by increases resulting from the fourth quarter 2009 issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term notes and the first quarter 2008 issuance of $500 million of long-term notes. Interest expense for 2008 was $341 million, or $11 million lower than 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to the August 2008 redemption of the floating rate convertible debentures, partially offset by an increase due the first quarter 2008 issuance of $500 million of long-term notes. Other non-operating income (expense), net was income of $123 million in 2009 compared to expense of $88 million in 2008. The increase primarily was due to net unrealized gains on marketable securities held in a Rabbi Trust to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations partially offset by lower interest income on invested cash balances. Other non-operating income (expense), net was expense of $88 million in 2008 compared to income of $193 million in 2007. The decrease in 2008 primarily was due to net unrealized losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations and lower interest income on invested cash balances. Our effective income tax rates were 29.4% for 2009, 31.6% for 2008, and 30.6% for 2007. These rates were lower than the statutory rate of 35% for all periods due to tax benefits for U.S. manufacturing activities, dividends related to our employee stock ownership plans, and the research and development tax credit. In addition, the rate for 2009 reflected a tax benefit of $69 million arising from the resolution of IRS examinations of the 2005 to 2007 and 2008 tax years and an additional tax benefit from the partial elimination of a valuation allowance previously provided against certain foreign company deferred tax assets arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits. The rate for 2007 reflected a tax benefit of $59 million arising from the closure of the IRS examination of the 2003 and 2004 tax years. We reported net earnings of $3.0 billion ($7.78 per share) in 2009, $3.2 billion ($7.86 per share) in 2008, and $3.0 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2007. Both net earnings and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share has benefitted from the significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. The effect of those repurchases has been partially offset by common stock issued under our stock-based compensation and defined contribution plans. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 4 to the financial statements. We have a number of programs that are classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Key Combat Aircraft programs include the F-35 Lightning II, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft. The F-35 has completed the eighth year of development and has entered low rate initial production (LRIP). We expect the first deliveries under the LRIP program to begin in 2010 which, together with other program activities, will result in an increase in sales over 2009 levels. We continue to produce F-16 aircraft for foreign customers, delivering a total of 31 F-16s in 2009 worldwide. We are currently projecting that F-16 sales will decline in 2010 over 2009 levels due to lower deliveries. Aeronautics has been producing F-22s since 1997. As noted previously, the U.S Government has decided to discontinue production of the F-22 after delivery of the 187 aircraft on order, which we expect will occur in early 2012. Key Air Mobility programs include the C-130J Super Hercules and the C-5M Super Galaxy. We are expecting to ramp up production and increase deliveries of C-130J aircraft in 2010, having delivered 16 in 2009. In addition to aircraft production, Aeronautics provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification services for its aircraft. Sales at Aeronautics are expected to grow overall in 2010 primarily due to the projected increase in F-35 production activities. Our Electronic Systems business segment manages complex programs and designs, develops, and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide. With such a broad portfolio of products and services, many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production 39 Table of Contents contracts with varying delivery schedules. This business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a systems integrator both domestically and internationally. Some of its more significant programs, including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the Aegis Weapon System, and the Littoral Combat Ship program, demonstrate the diverse products and services Electronic Systems provides. Our IS&GS business segment combines a full range of information competencies with a global delivery capability. The segment provides full life-cycle support and expertise in the areas of software and systems engineering, including capabilities in space, air, and ground systems. It provides logistics, mission operation support, peacekeeping, and nation-building services for a wide variety of defense and civil government agencies in the U.S. and abroad. IS&GS’ key programs and activities include the En-Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) program, the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program, the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS 2010) program, and a number of task order vehicles (indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts) across each of its lines of business. Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Government satellite programs include the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Global Positioning Satellite III (GPS III) system, and the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS). Strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program. Space transportation includes the NASA Orion program. Through ownership interests in two joint ventures, United Launch Alliance (ULA) and United Space Alliance (USA), the segment also includes expendable launch services and Space Shuttle processing activities for the U.S. Government. The Space Shuttle is expected to finish its final flight mission in 2010 and our programs involving its launch and processing activities will end at that time. In the following table of financial data, total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. Because the activities of the investees in which certain business segments hold equity interests are closely aligned with the operations of those segments, the equity earnings (losses) from those investees are included in the operating profit of the segments. Our largest equity investees are ULA and USA. Their equity earnings are included in Space System’s operating profit. The reconciling item “Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net” includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see the discussion in “Discussion of Business Segments” under “Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net”), costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. This table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 12,201 $ 11,473 $ 12,303 Electronic Systems 12,204 11,620 11,143 Information Systems & Global Services 12,130 11,611 10,213 Space Systems 8,654 8,027 8,203 Total $ 45,189 $ 42,731 $ 41,862 Operating Profit Aeronautics $ 1,577 $ 1,433 $ 1,476 Electronic Systems 1,595 1,508 1,410 Information Systems & Global Services 1,011 1,076 949 Space Systems 972 953 856 Total business segments $ 5,155 4,970 4,691 Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net (689 ) 161 (164 ) Total $ 4,466 $ 5,131 $ 4,527 The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $78.0 billion, $80.9 billion, and $76.7 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $49.0 billion at December 31, 2009. 40 Table of Contents In our discussion of comparative results, changes in net sales and operating profit are expressed in terms of volume and/or performance. Volume refers to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or services levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimated profit rate at completion for a particular contract for products. Performance generally refers to changes in contract profit booking rates. These changes on our contracts for products usually relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contracts that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating or award fee performance on a particular contract. Changes in contract profit booking rates on contracts for products are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Recognition of an inception-to-date adjustment in the current or prior periods may affect the comparison of segment operating results. Segment Operating Profit (In millions) Aeronautics Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,201 $ 11,473 $ 12,303 Operating profit 1,577 1,433 1,476 Backlog at year-end 26,700 27,200 26,300 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, sales increased in all three lines of business. The increase of $296 million in Air Mobility’s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the C-130 programs, including deliveries and support activities. There were 16 C-130J deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008. Combat Aircraft sales increased $316 million principally due to higher volume on the F-35 program and increases in F-16 deliveries, which partially were offset by lower volume on F-22 and other combat aircraft programs. The $116 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was due to higher volume on P-3 programs and advanced development programs, which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities. Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in net sales was due to decreases in Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility, which more than offset increases in Other Aeronautics Programs. Combat Aircraft sales declined $947 million due to lower volume on F-16, F-22 and F-35 programs. The $74 million decrease in Air Mobility primarily was due to lower volume on other air mobility programs. There were 12 C-130J deliveries in both 2008 and 2007. The $191 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was due to higher volume in sustainment services activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 10% in 2009 compared to 2008. The growth in operating profit primarily was due to increases in Air Mobility and Other Aeronautics Programs. The $70 million increase in Air Mobility’s operating profit primarily was due to the higher volume on C-130J deliveries and C-130 support programs. In Other Aeronautics Programs, operating profit increased $120 million, which mainly was attributable to improved performance in sustainment activities and higher volume on P-3 programs. Additionally, the increase in operating profit included the favorable restructuring of a P-3 modification contract in 2009. Combat Aircraft’s operating profit decreased $22 million during the year primarily due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on F-16 programs in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower volume 41 Table of Contents on other combat aircraft programs. These decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on the F-35 program and an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the F-22 program in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit for the segment decreased 3% in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit declines in Combat Aircraft partially were offset by increases in Other Aeronautics Programs and Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, operating profit declined $86 million mainly due to lower volume on F-16 programs and lower volume and the decline in 2008 of the amount of favorable inception-to-date performance adjustments on the F-22 program. There was a $34 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs, which mainly was due to higher volume in sustainment services activities that partially was offset by a decrease in operating profit due to performance on a P-3 modification contract. In Air Mobility, operating profit increased $13 million mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on C-130 support activities, which more than offset a decline on C-5 programs. Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to sales exceeding orders on the F-22 and F-35 programs, which partially were offset by orders exceeding sales on the C-130J and C-5 programs. Backlog increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to increased orders on the C-130J and F-35 programs, which were partially offset by declines resulting from sales volume on the F-22 program. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,204 $ 11,620 $ 11,143 Operating profit 1,595 1,508 1,410 Backlog at year-end 21,900 22,500 21,200 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 5% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, sales increased in all three lines of business. The increase in sales of $394 million at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) primarily was due to growth on tactical missile programs and fire control systems. Platforms & Training (P&T) sales increased $122 million, primarily due to growth on simulation and training activities partially offset by lower volume on platform integration activities. The increase in simulation and training also included sales from the first quarter 2009 acquisition of Universal Systems and Technology, Inc. The increase in sales of $67 million at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) mainly was due to higher volume on radar systems, surface naval warfare, and tactical systems programs, which partially were offset by a decline in integrated defense technologies. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales increases in M&FC and MS2 more than offset a decline in P&T. M&FC sales increased $327 million mainly due to higher volume on fire control and tactical missile programs. MS2 sales grew $189 million primarily due to higher volume on integrated defense technology, undersea warfare and radar systems activities. The decline of $39 million in P&T’s sales mainly was due to lower volume on platform integration activities. Operating profit for the segment increased 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, increases in operating profit at M&FC and P&T more than offset declines at MS2. Operating profit increased $114 million at M&FC mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on fire control systems and tactical missile programs. The increase in operating profit of $40 million at P&T primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance on simulation and training activities. Additionally, the increase included a benefit recognized in 2009 from favorably resolving a simulation and training contract matter. These increases partially were offset by lower volume on platform integration activities and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on distribution technology programs in 2009 compared to 2008. There was a $67 million decrease in operating profit at MS2, which primarily was attributable to lower volume on integrated defense technology programs and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on tactical systems, integrated defense technology, and undersea warfare programs in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit for the segment increased by 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2008, operating profit increases at M&FC and MS2 more than offset a decrease at P&T. Operating profit increased $60 million at M&FC mainly due to improved performance on air defense programs and higher volume on tactical missile and fire control programs. There was a $71 million increase in operating profit at MS2, which mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on integrated defense technology, surface naval warfare, undersea warfare, and radar systems programs. P&T’s operating profit declined $33 million primarily due to performance on platform integration activities. 42 Table of Contents Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the U.S. Government’s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter Program at P&T, which resulted in a $985 million reduction in orders. This decline more than offset increased orders on integrated defense technology and tactical system programs at MS2, air defense programs at M&FC, and simulation and training activities at P&T. The increase in backlog during 2008 compared to 2007 resulted primarily from increased orders on surface naval warfare programs at MS2 and on tactical missile programs at M&FC. These increases partially were offset by declines in orders on integrated defense technology and tactical systems programs at MS2. Effective January 1, 2010, the ground vehicles line of business from the former Systems Integration – Owego, which includes the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, was realigned as part of Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control. Additionally, the remaining Systems Integration – Owego businesses were realigned with the former Maritime Systems & Sensors line of business to form a new line of business, Mission Systems & Sensors. These changes had no impact on the segment’s operating results in 2009. Information Systems & Global Services As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2009, IS&GS redefined its lines of business to better align the segment based on its core customers and business activities. The new lines of business are as follows: • Civil – supports civil agency customer missions; • Defense – supports defense customer missions; and • Intelligence – supports intelligence customer missions. The realignment had no impact on the segment’s operating results. The prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new lines of business. IS&GS’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,130 $ 11,611 $ 10,213 Operating profit 1,011 1,076 949 Backlog at year-end 12,600 13,300 11,800 Net sales for IS&GS increased 4% in 2009 compared to 2008. Sales increases in Defense and Civil partially were offset by slight declines in Intelligence. Defense sales increased $338 million primarily due to higher volume on mission and combat systems activities and readiness and stability operations. Net sales at Civil increased by $197 million principally due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services, which more than offset lower volume on Pacific Architect & Engineers Inc. (PAE) programs. Intelligence sales declined slightly by $17 million mainly due to lower volume on enterprise integration activities. Net sales for IS&GS increased by 14% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales increased in all three lines of business during the year. Defense’s sales increased $642 million principally due to higher volume on mission and combat systems activities and readiness and stability operations. Civil’s sales increased by $612 million primarily due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services and PAE programs. There was a $145 million increase in Intelligence’s sales, which mainly was due to higher volume on security solutions and enterprise integration activities. Operating profit for the segment decreased by 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit declines in Civil and Intelligence more than offset growth in Defense. The decrease of $66 million in Civil’s operating profit primarily was attributable to lower volume and performance on PAE programs. The decline in Civil also included a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit of $35 million at Intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower volume on enterprise integration activities. The increase in Defense’s operating profit of $15 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems and readiness and stability operations, which more than offset lower performance on global programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 13% in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit increased in all three lines of business during the year. Civil’s operating profit increased by $59 million due to higher volume and improved performance on enterprise civilian services. Defense’s operating profit increased $39 million primarily due to volume and improved performance in readiness and stability operations. In Intelligence, operating profit increased by $14 million due to higher volume on enterprise integration activities. 43 Table of Contents Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the U.S. Government’s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) contract at Defense, which resulted in a $1.6 billion reduction in orders. This decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at Civil and on readiness and stability operations programs at Defense. The increase in backlog during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily was due to increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at Civil and on mission and combat systems and readiness and stability operations programs at Defense. Space Systems Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 8,654 $ 8,027 $ 8,203 Operating profit 972 953 856 Backlog at year-end 16,800 17,900 17,400 Net sales for Space Systems increased 8% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, sales growth at Satellites and Space Transportation more than offset a decline in Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS). The sales growth of $707 million in Satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities, which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities. There was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008. The increase in sales of $21 million in Space Transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the Orion program, which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle external tank program. There was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008. S&DMS’ sales decreased by $102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs, which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. Net sales for Space Systems decreased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales declines in Satellites partially were offset by growth in Space Transportation. In Satellites, sales declined $579 million due to lower volume in both commercial and government satellite activities. There were two commercial satellite deliveries during 2008, compared to four in 2007. Space Transportation sales increased $427 million primarily due to higher volume on the Orion program. Operating profit for the segment increased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, operating profit growth at Satellites more than offset declines at Space Transportation and S&DMS. In Satellites, the operating profit increase of $88 million mainly was due to higher volume on government satellite activities, which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities. The decrease of $46 million in Space Transportation’s operating profit mainly was attributable to the absence in 2009 of a benefit recognized in 2008 from the successful negotiations of a terminated commercial launch vehicle contract, lower volume on the space shuttle external tank program, and lower equity earnings in 2009 on the ULA joint venture. The decrease in S&DMS’ operating profit of $19 million primarily was attributable to a lower volume on defensive missile programs and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments in 2009 compared to 2008 on strategic missile programs. Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems, which includes ULA and USA, represented 22% of the segment’s operating profit in 2009 compared to 24% in 2008. Operating profit increased by 11% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating profit was due to Space Transportation, which partially was offset by a decline in Satellites. In Space Transportation, the $135 million increase mainly was attributable to higher equity earnings on the ULA joint venture, volume on the Orion program, and the results from successful negotiations of a terminated commercial launch service contract in the first quarter of 2008. The improvement in ULA’s earnings also reflects the absence in 2008 of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2007 for asset impairment on the Delta II medium lift launch vehicles. In Satellites, operating profit declined by $42 million during the year due to lower volume and performance on certain government satellite programs. Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems represented 24% of the segment’s operating profit in 2008 compared to 16% in 2007 The decrease in backlog during 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to declines in orders and higher sales volume on the Orion program in Space Transportation and on government satellite programs in Satellites. The increase in backlog during 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased orders on government satellite programs and on the Orion program. 44 Table of Contents Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the components of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (456 ) $ 128 $ (58 ) Items not considered in segment operating performance — 193 71 Stock compensation expense (154 ) (155 ) (149 ) Other, net (79 ) (5 ) (28 ) $ (689 ) $ 161 $ (164 ) The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Because the CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in a particular segment’s net sales and cost of sales, the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Accordingly, the FAS/CAS adjustment is not included in segment operating results, but is included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under GAAP. The following table shows the CAS funding that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS pension expense, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 FAS pension expense $ (1,036 ) $ (462 ) $ (687 ) Less: CAS expense and funding (580 ) (590 ) (629 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – income (expense) $ (456 ) $ 128 $ (58 ) The FAS pension expense increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate and amortization of the actuarial losses incurred in 2008 as a result of the significant negative return on plan assets compared to our 8.5% long-term rate of return assumption (see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans”). The FAS pension expense decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate and other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets at the respective plan measurement dates through December 31, 2007. Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by GAAP. For example, gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by Corporate, as well as certain other Corporate activities, are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments. There were no such items in 2009; however, for purposes of segment reporting, the following items were included in unallocated Corporate income (expense), net for 2008 and 2007: (In millions, except per share data) OperatingProfit Net Earnings EarningsPer Share Year ended December 31, 2008 Recognition of deferred gain on LKEI and ILS $ 108 $ 70 $ 0.17 Elimination of reserves associated with various land sales 85 56 0.14 $ 193 $ 126 $ 0.31 Year ended December 31, 2007 Gain on sale of interest in Comsat International $ 25 $ 16 $ 0.04 Gain on sale of land in California 25 16 0.04 Reversal of legal reserves due to settlement 21 14 0.03 $ 71 $ 46 $ 0.11 The change in the “Other, net” component of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net, between the periods primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with a number of Corporate activities. 45 Table of Contents Liquidity and Cash Flows Our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the adverse changes in economic and market conditions over the past two years. We continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, required retirement plan funding, and certain other discretionary funding needs. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed and when opportunistic, including the issuance of debt securities totaling $1.5 billion in 2009 and $500 million in 2008. We expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures. We have financing resources available (see discussion under Capital Resources) to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary. We have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes (e.g., guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts). Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. For example, contracts may be cost reimbursable, time and materials, or fixed price. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts, which together represent approximately 65% of the revenues we recorded in 2009, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast to cost reimbursable contracts, for fixed price contracts we generally do not bill until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our contracts may provide for performance-based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work. Fixed price contracts represented approximately 35% of the revenues we recorded in 2009. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2009 and those planned for 2010 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and information technology (IT). Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities, some of which are as much as 50 years old. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business (e.g., capital expenditures, independent research and development), made selective acquisitions of businesses, repurchased shares, increased our dividends, and managed our debt levels. The following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.2 billion to $3.2 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease primarily was attributable to an increase in discretionary contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, which were $1,482 million in 2009 and $109 million in 2008, a $193 million decline in net earnings, and a decrease in cash provided by operating working capital of $147 million. This decrease partially was offset by the effects of an increase in the FAS pension expense, which was $1,036 million in 2009 and $462 million in 2008, and lower net tax payments of $319 million compared to 2008. The decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the Platforms and Training line of business at Electronic Systems and an increase in inventories on Combat Aircraft programs at Aeronautics, which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on Government Satellite programs at Space and the timing of accounts payable activities. Operating working capital accounts consist of receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $183 million to $4.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase primarily was attributable to an increase in net earnings of $184 million, a decrease of $429 million in total contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans, and a $100 million dividend received from ULA. This increase was offset partially by a $291 million decrease in cash provided by 46 Table of Contents working capital and higher net tax payments of $103 million compared to 2007. The decline in operating working capital primarily was due to an increase in inventories on Combat Aircraft programs at Aeronautics and a decrease in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on various programs in the Missiles & Fire Control line of business at Electronic Systems. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) Investing Activities Capital expenditures – The majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology (IT) to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $852 million in 2009, $926 million in 2008, and $940 million in 2007. We expect that our annual capital expenditures over the next three years, which are expected to be $1.0 billion or more per year, will be sufficient to support the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – We have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our strategic, operational, and financial targets; help build a balanced portfolio; and provide disciplined growth. As disclosed under the caption “Acquisition and Divestiture Activities,” we paid $435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities, including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, compared with $233 million in 2008 and $337 million in 2007. There were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008. In 2007, we received proceeds of $26 million from the sale of our remaining interest in Comsat International. Financing Activities Share activity and dividends – Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2009, 2008, and 2007 totaled $40 million, $250 million, and $350 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 1.0 million shares, 4.7 million shares, and 7.1 million shares during the respective periods. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we used cash of $1,851 million, $2,931 million, and $2,127 million for common share repurchase activity (see Note 11). Our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 178.0 million shares of our common stock from time-to-time at management’s discretion, including 20.0 million of additional shares our Board authorized for repurchase in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 149.2 million shares under the program, and there remained approximately 28.8 million shares that may be repurchased in the future. The payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $908 million in 2009, $737 million in 2008, and $615 million in 2007. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years. We declared quarterly dividends: in 2009 of $0.57 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.63 per share for the last quarter; in 2008 of $0.42 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.57 per share for the last quarter; and in 2007 of $0.35 per share during each of the first three quarters and $0.42 per share for the last quarter. Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – We issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in 2009 and $500 million of long-term notes in 2008. In 2009, we paid $242 million in repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled 47 Table of Contents maturities. In 2008, we paid a total of $1.0 billion representing the principal amount of our floating rate convertible debentures that were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed (see Note 9). We also paid another $103 million during 2008 related to other repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities, compared to $32 million in debt repayments in 2007. Capital Structure and Resources At December 31, 2009, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.4 billion and short-term investments of $346 million. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $5.1 billion. As of the end of 2009, our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes and debentures. In November 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering (see Note 9), $900 million of which are due in 2019 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.25%, and $600 million of which are due in 2039 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 5.50%. In 2008, we issued $500 million of long-term notes in a registered public offering (see Note 9) that are due in 2013 and have a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In August 2008, all of our $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible debentures were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed, and we issued 5.0 million shares of our common stock to satisfy the related conversion obligations of $571 million in excess of the principal amount (see Note 9). Our stockholders’ equity amounted to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2008. The increase primarily was due to net earnings of $3.0 billion; the annual remeasurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans at December 31 (see Note 10), which decreased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $495 million; and employee stock activity of $445 million. These increases partially were offset by the repurchase of 24.9 million common shares for $1.9 billion and payment of $908 million of dividends during the year. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $1.4 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 55% at December 31, 2009, down from 57% at December 31, 2008. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 primarily was attributable to the increase in stockholders’ equity discussed above, which was partially offset by the issuance of long-term notes in November 2009. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 57% for 2008 compared to 31% in 2007. This increase from 2007 to 2008 primarily was attributable to the decrease in stockholders’ equity through the remeasurement of the postretirement benefit plans which increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $7.25 billion, the repurchase of 29 million common shares for $2.9 billion, and payment of $737 million of dividends during 2008. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $3.2 billion and employee stock activity of $746 million. Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio Return on invested capital (ROIC) declined by 180 basis points during 2009 to 19.9%. We define ROIC as net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders’ equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations. We use ROIC as one of the inputs in our evaluation of multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. 48 Table of Contents ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. See Consolidated Financial Data – Five Year Summary on page 24 of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning how we calculate ROIC. Return on Invested Capital Ratio At December 31, 2009, we had in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which expires in June 2012. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2009. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank defined Base Rate. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to our postretirement benefit plans. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. As described above, we issued $1.5 billion of long-term notes under this shelf registration in November 2009 for general corporate purposes. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market, and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,403 $ — $ — $ 650 $ 4,753 Interest payments 5,817 338 677 626 4,176 Other liabilities 2,253 494 460 232 1,067 Operating lease obligations 1,459 314 494 296 355 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 21,049 11,932 7,672 1,380 65 Capital expenditures 230 169 61 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 36,211 $ 13,247 $ 9,364 $ 3,184 $ 10,416 (a) The total amount of long-term debt excludes the unamortized discount of $351 million (see Note 9). 49 Table of Contents Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. Interest payments include interest related to the outstanding debt through maturity. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2009. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and business acquisition agreements. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of obligations for sites at which we are performing remediation activities, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party. The amounts also include liabilities related to tax positions we have taken (see Note 8). We estimated the timing of tax payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $19.5 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. However, the U.S. Government would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. For example, if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our U.S. Government customer and the customer terminated the contract for its convenience, any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments, as well as amounts previously incurred, would generally be reimbursed by the customer in accordance with the FAR. This would also be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $10.0 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, some of which extend through 2025. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2009 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties. In connection with the closing of the transaction to form ULA on December 1, 2006, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) each committed to providing up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and $200 million in other financial support to ULA, as required. The non-capital financial support is required to be made in the form of a revolving credit facility between us and ULA or guarantees of ULA financing with third parties, in either case to the extent necessary for ULA to meet its working capital needs. We have agreed to provide this support for at least five years from the closing date of the transaction, and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand. To satisfy our non-capital financial support commitment, we and Boeing put into place at closing a revolving credit agreement with ULA, under which no amounts have been drawn. As of December 31, 2009, we and Boeing each had provided the $25 million of funding to ULA under the additional capital contribution commitment. Of that amount, $22 million was contributed in the second quarter of 2009, prior to which we each received a dividend from ULA in a like amount. Other than the $22 million contribution, we did not provide further 50 Table of Contents funding to ULA during 2009. In 2008, we and Boeing each received a $100 million dividend payment. Prior to distribution of that dividend, we, Boeing and ULA entered into an agreement whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources and/or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make such payments. Such capital contributions would not exceed the aggregate amount of the dividends we received through June 1, 2009, which totaled $122 million. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under this agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified ULA related to certain financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds, or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2009, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities. We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts. In some cases, we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than 1 Year (a) Years 2 and 3 (a) Years 4 and 5 (a) After 5 Years (a) Standby letters of credit $ 2,593 $ 2,165 $ 355 $ 56 $ 17 Surety bonds 408 399 9 — — Guarantees 559 41 8 57 453 Total commitments $ 3,560 $ 2,605 $ 372 $ 113 $ 470 (a) Approximately $2,045 million, $180 million, $6 million, and $1 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “Years 2 and 3,” “Years 4 and 5,” and “After 5 Years” periods, and approximately $49 million and $1 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” and “Years 2 and 3” periods, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $383 million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $1.8 billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this not only internally, through our independent research and development activities, but also through acquisitions. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. Conversely, we may also explore the divestiture of businesses, investments, and real estate. If we were to decide to sell any such assets, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are completed and losses, if any, would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired. Acquisitions In 2009, we used approximately $435 million for acquisition activities, including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates. We accounted for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition activities in 2009 included the following, among others: • Universal Systems & Technology, Inc., which provides interactive training and simulation, homeland security, and technical solutions to various U.S. and international government agencies; and 51 Table of Contents • Gyrocam Systems LLC, which develops and supplies gyrostabilized optical surveillance systems and sustainment field services, primarily to the U.S. military. In 2008, we used approximately $233 million for acquisition activities, including, among others, Eagle Group International, LLC, which provides logistics, information technology, training, and healthcare services to the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2007, we used approximately $337 million for acquisition activities, including an additional contribution of $177 million related to our investment in ULA (see Note 14). Those activities also included the acquisition of, among others, Management Systems Designers, Inc., a provider of information technology (IT) and scientific solutions supporting government life science, national security, and other civil agency missions. In each year, the amounts used for acquisitions included certain payments related to businesses acquired in prior years. In 2008 and 2007, we accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting, and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2009, 2008, or 2007. Divestitures Divestiture activities in 2009 were not material and there were no divestiture activities in 2008. During 2007, we monetized certain of our equity investments and real estate by divesting the following: • Our remaining 20% interest in Comsat International, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share); and • Certain land in California, which resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $25 million in other income (expense), net, and increased net earnings by $16 million ($0.04 per share). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments was approximately $5.9 billion, compared with a carrying value of $5.4 billion, excluding the $351 million unamortized discount. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our foreign currency exchange contracts, the majority of which qualify for hedge accounting treatment, hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized in income. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period. At December 31, 2009, the net fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding was a liability of $2 million (see Note 1 under the caption “Derivative financial instruments”). We had no interest rate derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2009. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a Rabbi Trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2009, investments in the Rabbi Trust totaled $757 million and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other assets. The Rabbi Trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed 52 Table of Contents to price changes and changes in interest rates. Changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in other non-operating income (expense), net. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded earnings totaling $110 million related to the increase in the value of the Rabbi Trust assets. We also contributed $171 million to the Rabbi Trust in 2009. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the Rabbi Trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in unallocated Corporate costs. The current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our Balance Sheet in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes, and the non-current portion of the liability is on our Balance Sheet in other liabilities. The resulting change in the value of the liabilities has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded expense of $45 million related to the increase in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There are a number of new accounting pronouncements and interpretations that are not effective until after December 31, 2009 and may impact our financial statements and disclosures. See Note 1 under the caption “Recent accounting pronouncements” for more information. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities (in some cases, we are only a passive equity holder), our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. We routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of two or more business units, and migrating certain processes to our Shared Services centers. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2009. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, and under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating and effective as of December 31, 2009 to provide reasonable assurance that information is communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure, assets are safeguarded, and transactions are properly executed and recorded. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. During 2009, our management performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including performing self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based on those activities and other evaluation procedures, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. Management’s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page 54. In addition, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 55. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview Lockheed Martin is a global security company that principally is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2010, 84% of our $45.8 billion in net sales were made to the U.S. Government. Approximately 60% of our net sales were made to the Department of Defense (DoD), with approximately 24% attributable to non-DoD agencies. Sales to foreign governments (including foreign military sales funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government) amounted to 15% of net sales in 2010. The remainder of our net sales was attributable to commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and government information technology. We operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing economic pressures in the United States and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on core program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing more security capability into the hands of our customers at affordable prices. We also are focused on cost reduction, through programs like our recent Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP) and facility reduction initiatives, to further enhance the affordability of our products and services. While we expect our sales to increase in the low single digits for 2011, growth rates are slowing for our company and across the industry as compared to prior years as our customers are preparing to meet new security challenges without the benefit of increased resources in any given fiscal year. We expect our segment operating profit for 2011 to be consistent with 2010 as margins face pressure in this environment. Despite the challenges we face, we expect to generate strong operating cash flows, which allows us to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, invest in our people so that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to be successful in this environment, and return at least 50% of free cash flow1 to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities The U.S. Government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. The Administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities with the cost of these initiatives and increased deficit spending, particularly in the longer term. Although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year, the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. The possibility remains, however, that one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the Administration’s continuing assessment of priorities. The Administration’s spending priorities were released on February 14, 2011 with the submission of the President’s Budget Request for fiscal year 2012. Every year, Congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the President’s annual budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which then require final Presidential approval. The outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business. 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less the amount identified as expenditures for property, plant and equipment as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 23 Table of Contents Department of Defense Business The DoD base budget has seen consistent growth over the past ten years, enabling it to grow from $300 billion at the start of the last decade to $553 billion in the President’s baseline budget request for fiscal year 2012. The fiscal year 2012 request represents nominal growth of 5.1% over the fiscal year 2011 baseline budget of $526 billion. This 2011 baseline budget assumes that the continuing resolution currently in place (see discussion below) is extended through the end of fiscal year 2011. Preliminary insights into national security funding priorities for fiscal year 2012 and beyond were revealed on January 6, 2011 by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Specifically, his defense spending proposal reflected a slight increase in nominal growth over the next few years. To date, Congress has funded U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations, through a separate Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding outside of the base DoD budget. The OCO funding for fiscal year 2011 totaled $159 billion, and the Administration requested $118 billion in fiscal year 2012. Our sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests, and therefore we continue to focus our attention on the DoD’s base budget for support and funding of our programs. In December 2010, Congress passed a continuing resolution funding measure for fiscal year 2011 to finance all U.S. Government activities through March 4, 2011. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for fiscal year 2010 are available, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our sales and profit during the period. The current continuing resolution has not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The arrival of a new Congress in January 2011 with the House of Representatives and Senate under control of different political parties creates the potential for some uncertainty as to whether the government will continue to operate under a continuing resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year or will be able to enact appropriations legislation. We believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD. As the DoD increases its emphasis on affordability in the current fiscal environment and continues to respond to the increasingly complex and dynamic global security environment, many of our products remain well-positioned to meet the needs of the military services. For example, while Secretary Gates proposed changes to our F-35 program which will affect the aircraft’s development and transition to production (see the F-35 discussion under the caption “Other Business Considerations” in this section), the aircraft remains a national priority. Additionally, the U.S. Navy plans to evolve the Aegis air and missile defense system through modernization programs to derive maximum utility over the long service lives of these systems. The Navy also recently decided to procure up to ten additional Littoral Combat Ships from us over the next five years. The need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cybersecurity, all appear to continue to be national priorities. To address these priorities, we have been growing our portfolio in these areas, diversifying our business, and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, rotary wing aviation, and land vehicles. We have expanded production of the C-130J Super Hercules tactical airlifter to meet the needs of the U.S. Government and international customers. Despite recent proposed changes, we continue to prepare for increased production of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter for the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and international partners in future years. This program continues to be a significant element of a broader U.S. effort to build the capacity of alliance partners throughout the world. In the areas of space-based intelligence and information superiority, we are the prime contractor on programs such as the Global Positioning Satellite program, Mobile User Objective System, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system, the Space-Based Infrared System-High, and classified programs. Our products are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air, and space-based missile defense, including the Aegis, the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC) missile program, and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) transportable defensive missile system. We continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and EQ-36 radar systems. We also have unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. 24 Table of Contents In the area of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs, our capabilities include the Airborne Maritime Fixed Joint Tactical Radio System, the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical, the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System, and the Global Communications Support System – Air Force. We have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the DoD’s information technology systems. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost-effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers, and for improving global supply chain management. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Archives, and the Library of Congress. All non-defense agencies also are operating under a continuing resolution that requires them to remain at fiscal year 2010 funding levels. In addition, the President’s budget proposes a three-year freeze in certain civil agency budgets, including agencies to which we provide products and services. We believe our key programs will continue to be supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance, and enterprise solutions. In the civil arena, as with our defense business, we have not seen a significant effect on our business from the Administration’s stated policy of in-sourcing. We believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions, but at a somewhat slower pace in the near term. Consistent with our DoD business, more affordable logistics and sustainment, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cybersecurity all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. The continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. Other Business Considerations International Business We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. We conduct business with foreign governments primarily through Aeronautics and Electronic Systems. Our international sales are composed of “foreign military sales” through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II, while other countries such as Israel have recently selected the F-35 as their next generation combat aircraft. We expect international deliveries of the F-35 to begin in 2012. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 25 countries, with 53 follow-on buys from 14 countries. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft’s international footprint with customers in 15 countries including recent orders from Israel, Kuwait, Korea, and Tunisia. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for Norway’s P-3 fleet. We have also received awards from the U.S. and Canadian governments to upgrade their P-3 aircraft. With regard to the Aegis Weapon System, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea, Norway, and Australia. The system also has been selected to be used as a ground-based missile defense system in Europe, referred to as “Aegis Ashore.” This segment has contracts with the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of 25 Table of Contents combat systems on Halifax class frigates. The new Littoral Combat Ship is also generating interest from potential international customers. Electronic Systems also produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). International customers have also expressed interest in our THAAD defensive missile system. To the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries, other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries, and the potential for deterioration of political relations. Status of the F-35 Program The System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion of the F-35 program has experienced schedule delays, work scope changes, and cost increases. In the second quarter of 2010, the DoD recertified the F-35 program after completing a legally required review of the program’s priority, capability, cost, and management structure in accordance with the Nunn-McCurdy process established under federal law. The Nunn-McCurdy process requires notification to the U.S. Congress if DoD program cost estimates exceed specified threshold levels, and includes a requirement that a program be terminated if cost estimates increase by 50% above the original program baseline, unless the DoD makes prescribed findings about the program. As part of that process, the DoD certified that continuation of the F-35 program is essential to national security, among other required findings. In connection with the recertification, the DoD tasked the F-35 program executive officer to complete a technical baseline review which addressed program requirements, schedule, and cost. On January 6, 2011, the Secretary of Defense outlined the recommendations of the technical baseline review. Those recommendations included adding funding to the F-35 development program and extending development through 2016. These funds are to be used for additional development scope, for testing and risk retirement activities to better position the program for production, and to correct prior estimates. The Secretary of Defense also identified the U.S. Air Force Conventional Take-off and Landing (CTOL) version and the Navy carrier version, which represent over 85 percent of the planned domestic production run, as proceeding satisfactorily in development. Testing challenges and delays on the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant resulted in a decision to decouple STOVL testing from the other models and to move the development of the STOVL aircraft to the back of the overall Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) production sequence. We believe that these actions will better position the STOVL variant to demonstrate improved reliability over the next two years. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be additional reviews related to program schedule, cost, requirements, and aircraft quantities as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include completion of the flight testing, supply chain performance, and software development. The SDD portion of the F-35 program has $586 million of fee remaining. Any portion of the remaining fee that we or our partners receive is dependent upon completion of milestones, most of which have not yet been determined. Although not exclusively related to the F-35 program, on October 4, 2010, the Defense Contracting Management Agency (“DCMA”) withdrew its prior validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system (EVMS) at our Fort Worth, Texas location. EVMS is a tool for managing cost and schedule performance on complex programs. To re-establish EVMS compliance at Fort Worth, we need to demonstrate corrective actions have been implemented to address prior DCMA audit findings on EVMS affecting the F-35 and other Aeronautics programs which are managed at that location. The DCMA may choose to re-audit our EVMS system at any time, but we understand that the DCMA will do so once a performance history on the new SDD baseline is established. The new SDD baseline may not be established until after the initial baseline review is completed in late 2011. On October 7, 2010, the Israeli Government signed a letter of offer and acceptance with the U.S. Government for the procurement of F-35 aircraft. Israel is expected to be the first country to receive the F-35 through the U.S. Government’s foreign military sales process. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this internally through our independent research and development activities, and through acquisition, divestiture, and internal realignment activities. 26 Table of Contents We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. If we were to decide to sell a business, the resulting gains, if any, would be recorded when the transactions are completed or as otherwise required under GAAP and losses, if any, would be recorded when the carrying value of the related business is determined to be impaired. We also undertake internal realignment activities to adjust our portfolio of businesses to address changes in customer demand for our products and services. Divestitures In June 2010, we announced plans to divest Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE) and most of our Enterprise Integration Group (EIG), two businesses within our IS&GS reporting segment (see Note 2). PAE’s and EIG’s operating results are included in discontinued operations on our Statements of Earnings for all periods presented, and PAE’s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale on our 2010 Balance Sheet. In November 2010, we closed on the sale of EIG. Our decision to divest EIG was based on our analysis of the U.S. Government’s increased concerns about perceived organizational conflicts of interest within the defense contracting community. EIG provides systems engineering, architecture, and integration services and support to a broad range of government customers. On February 22, 2011, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell PAE. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2011, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. The plan to divest PAE is a result of changes in customer priorities. When we acquired the business, we envisioned it as an entry point to a new customer set that would need additional services, primarily in the areas of information technology and systems integration. Those customers, however, are seeking a different mix of services, such as the construction of facilities and provision of physical security, which does not fit with our long-term strategy. Realignment Activities In 2010, Electronic Systems realigned its lines of business which now operate as Mission Systems & Sensors (MS2), Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC), and Global Training & Logistics (GT&L). The realignment included the movement of two IS&GS businesses, Readiness & Stability Operations (RSO) and Savi Technology, Inc., to Electronic Systems (see Note 5). The realignment resulted in the combination of our ground vehicles programs, which were previously reported in the former Platforms & Training (P&T) line of business and included the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, with M&FC. We also realigned RSO and Savi Technology, Inc. with Electronic Systems’ simulation, training and support business (previously included in the former P&T line of business) to form GT&L. We combined the remaining elements of the former P&T line of business with the former Maritime Systems & Sensors line of business to form MS2. These realignment activities had no effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. All comparative financial information and related discussions of Electronic Systems and IS&GS in this Form 10-K reflects these realignment activities. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of design, development, and production (DD&P) contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a “per diluted share” basis. (In millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 2008 Operating Results Net Sales $ 45,803 $ 43,995 $ 41,372 Operating Profit 4,097 4,415 5,049 Interest Expense (345 ) (308 ) (332 ) Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net 74 123 (91 ) Income Tax Expense (1,181 ) (1,231 ) (1,459 ) Earnings from Continuing Operations 2,645 2,999 3,167 Earnings from Discontinued Operations 281 25 50 Net Earnings $ 2,926 $ 3,024 $ 3,217 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 7.18 $ 7.71 $ 7.74 Discontinued Operations .76 .07 .12 Total $ 7.94 $ 7.78 $ 7.86 27 Table of Contents The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our Statements of Earnings. The “Discussion of Business Segments” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business, and focus the discussion of our results of operations around major products and lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, and Space Systems segments, while most of our services sales are generated in our IS&GS segment. Continuing Operations For 2010, net sales were $45.8 billion, a 4% increase over 2009. Net sales for 2009 were $44.0 billion, a 6% increase over 2008 net sales of $41.4 billion. Net sales increased during 2010 in all segments except Space Systems as compared to 2009. Net sales increased during 2009 in all segments as compared to 2008 (see the Discussion of Business Segments). Our operating profit for 2010 was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to operating profit of $4.4 billion in 2009. The decline in operating profit of $318 million primarily was attributable to the effects of charges, net of state income tax benefits, of $178 million related to the VESP and $42 million related to facilities consolidation within the MS2 line of business in Electronic Systems (see Note 3). Also contributing to the decline was an increase of $71 million in other unallocated Corporate costs attributable to various Corporate activities. Our operating profit for 2009 was $4.4 billion, a decrease of 12% compared to operating profit of $5.0 billion 2008. In 2009, operating profit was negatively affected by the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (see Note 5 for a description of this adjustment), which was an expense of $456 million in 2009 as compared to income of $128 million in 2008 due to the negative actual return on plan assets in 2008 and a lower discount rate at December 31, 2008. In addition, operating profit was lower due to recognition of a deferred gain of $108 million in 2008 from the sale of our ownership interest in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS) in 2006 (see Note 3); earnings of $85 million recorded in 2008 associated with reserves related to various land sales that were no longer required (see Note 3); and a $24 million loss on the 2009 sale of a foreign subsidiary. These declines more than offset increased operating profit at the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems and Space Systems business segments. Interest expense for 2010 was $345 million, or $37 million higher than 2009. The increase mainly was driven by interest expense on the $1.5 billion of long-term notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2009. Interest expense for 2009 was $308 million, or $24 million lower than 2008. The decrease mainly was driven by the August 2008 redemption of our $1.0 billion of floating rate convertible debentures, partially offset by increases resulting from the fourth quarter 2009 issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term notes and the first quarter 2008 issuance of $500 million of long-term notes. Other non-operating income (expense), net was income of $74 million and $123 million in 2010 and 2009, and expense of $91 million in 2008. The changes between periods primarily reflect gains (losses) on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations. Our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 30.9% for 2010, 29.1% for 2009, and 31.5% for 2008. These rates were lower than the statutory rate of 35% for all periods due to tax benefits for U.S. manufacturing activities, the deduction of dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the research and development (R&D) tax credit. The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the tax deduction for company-paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. As a result, the Corporation recorded additional income tax expense of $96 million in 2010. The rate for 2010 also included additional tax benefits related to U.S. manufacturing activities primarily due to an increase in qualified production activity income and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing activity deduction rate from 6% to 9%. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected a reduction of income tax expense of $69 million primarily arising from the resolution of IRS examinations of the years 2005 through 2007 and 2008. We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.6 billion ($7.18 per share) in 2010, $3.0 billion ($7.71 per share) in 2009, and $3.2 billion ($7.74 per share) in 2008. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share has benefitted from the significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs (see Note 12). The effect of those repurchases has been partially offset by common stock issued under our stock-based compensation and defined contribution plans. 28 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations included the operating results for PAE and EIG for all periods presented. We reported net earnings from discontinued operations of $281 million ($.76 per share) in 2010, $25 million ($.07 per share) in 2009, and $50 million ($.12 per share) in 2008 (see Note 2). Earnings from discontinued operations for 2010 included a gain, net of income taxes, of $184 million ($.50 per share) from the sale of EIG. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell PAE in 2010, we recorded a $182 million deferred tax asset which reflects the federal and state tax benefits that we expect to realize on the sale, because our tax basis is higher than our book basis. Earnings from discontinued operations also included an impairment charge of $109 million related to the planned sale of PAE, as the carrying value of the business exceeded the expected net proceeds from the sale transaction. In total, these items associated with PAE increased 2010 earnings from discontinued operations by $73 million ($.20 per share). Discussion of Business Segments We operate in four principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The following table presents net sales and operating profit of our four business segments. Net sales exclude intersegment revenue, as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions are generally negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts. Operating profit of the business segments includes the equity earnings or losses from investees in which certain of our business segments hold equity interests, because the activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. Operating profit of the business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment discussed under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans” in the section on Critical Accounting Policies; expense for certain stock-based compensation programs including costs for stock options and restricted stock units; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as the charges related to the VESP in 2010 and the MS2 consolidation plan announced in 2010 (see Note 3); gains or losses from divestitures; the effects of legal settlements; Corporate costs not allocated to the business segments; and other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The items other than the charges related to the VESP and the MS2 consolidation plan are included in “Other unallocated Corporate income (expense), net” in the following table which reconciles operating profit from the business segments to operating profit in our Statements of Earnings. The charges related to the VESP and MS2 consolidation plan are presented together as a separate reconciling item. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 13,235 $ 12,201 $ 11,473 Electronic Systems 14,363 13,532 12,803 Information Systems & Global Solutions 9,959 9,608 9,069 Space Systems 8,246 8,654 8,027 Total $ 45,803 $ 43,995 $ 41,372 Operating Profit Aeronautics $ 1,502 $ 1,577 $ 1,433 Electronic Systems 1,712 1,660 1,583 Information Systems & Global Solutions 890 895 919 Space Systems 972 972 953 Total business segments $ 5,076 $ 5,104 4,888 VESP and other charges (220 ) — — Other unallocated Corporate income (expense), net (759 ) (689 ) 161 Total $ 4,097 $ 4,415 $ 5,049 The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $78.2 billion, $77.2 billion, and $80.1 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for 29 Table of Contents which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $49.7 billion at December 31, 2010. We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for our long-term design, development and production contracts, which we refer to as products in our Statements of Earnings. Under this method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimate of profit at completion for a particular contract. For example, if the cost volume on a cost-reimbursement-type contract increased or decreased compared with a prior period, sales and operating profit for that contract will also be increased or decreased. Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on our contracts for products. Performance changes usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating or award fee performance on a particular contract. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. For example, if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost reimbursable contract, the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher booking rate on both current period costs as well as previously incurred costs. Accordingly, such changes in the estimated profit booking rates may affect the comparison of segment operating results. For our services contracts, changes in volume are reflective of increases or decreases in the level of services being provided under each contract. Performance refers to changes in the levels of operating profit. Sales are recognized as the services are performed, typically on a straight-line basis. Award and incentive fees related to the performance on these contracts are recognized when communicated to us by the customer. Costs associated with these contracts are expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the timing for recognizing the effect of costs and award and incentive fees on our services contracts may affect the comparison of segment operating results. The Aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments. Due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments, the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs. The following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in Note 5 to the financial statements. We have a number of programs that are classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Key Combat Aircraft programs include the F-35 Lightning II, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft. Key Air Mobility programs include the C-130J Super Hercules and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification services for its aircraft. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 13,235 $ 12,201 $ 11,473 Operating profit 1,502 1,577 1,433 Operating margin 11.3 % 12.9 % 12.5 % Backlog at year-end 27,500 26,700 27,200 Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 8% in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales increased in all three lines of business during the year. The $800 million increase in Air Mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on C-130 programs, including deliveries and support activities, as well as higher volume on the C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining 30 Table of Contents Program (RERP). There were 25 C-130J deliveries in 2010 compared to 16 in 2009. The $179 million increase in Combat Aircraft principally was due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts, which partially was offset by lower volume on the F-35 SDD contract and a decline in volume on F-16, F-22 and other combat aircraft programs. There were 20 F-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009. The $55 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was due to higher volume on P-3 and advanced development programs, which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities. Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, sales increased in all three lines of business. The increase of $296 million in Air Mobility’s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the C-130 programs, including deliveries and support activities. There were 16 C-130J deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008. Combat Aircraft sales increased $316 million principally due to higher volume on the F-35 program and increases in F-16 deliveries, which partially were offset by lower volume on F-22 and other combat aircraft programs. There were 31 F-16 deliveries in 2009 compared to 28 in 2008. The $116 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was due to higher volume on P-3 programs and advanced development programs, which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities. Operating profit for the segment decreased by 5% in 2010 compared to 2009. A decline in operating profit in Combat Aircraft partially was offset by increases in Other Aeronautics Programs and Air Mobility. The $149 million decrease in Combat Aircraft’s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the F-22 program, the F-35 SDD contract and F-16 and other combat aircraft programs in 2010. These decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on F-35 production contracts in 2010. The $35 million increase in Other Aeronautics Programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on P-3 and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in 2010. The $19 million increase in Air Mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in 2010 on C-130J support activities, which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on C-130J deliveries in 2010. The remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income, net between the comparable periods. Aeronautics’ 2010 operating margins have decreased when compared to 2009. The operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs. Specifically, Aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the F-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the F-22 and F-16. Development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs. Accordingly, while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009, operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. Operating profit for the segment increased 10% in 2009 compared to 2008. The growth in operating profit primarily was due to increases in Air Mobility and Other Aeronautics Programs. The $70 million increase in Air Mobility’s operating profit primarily was due to the higher volume on C-130J deliveries and C-130 support programs. In Other Aeronautics Programs, operating profit increased $120 million, which mainly was attributable to improved performance in sustainment activities and higher volume on P-3 programs. Additionally, the increase in operating profit included the favorable restructuring of a P-3 modification contract in 2009. Combat Aircraft’s operating profit decreased $22 million during the year primarily due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on F-16 programs in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower volume on other combat aircraft programs. These decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on the F-35 program and an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the F-22 program in 2009 compared to 2008. The remaining change in operating profit is attributable to a decrease in other income, net, between the comparable periods. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the C-130J, F-35 and C-5 programs, which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the F-22 program in 2010. Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to sales exceeding orders on the F-22 and F-35 programs, which partially were offset by orders exceeding sales on the C-130J and C-5 programs. We expect Aeronautics will have sales growth in the upper single digit percentage range for 2011 as compared to 2010. This increase primarily is driven by growth on F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts, C-130J and C-5 RERP programs that will more than offset a decline on the F-22 program. Operating profit is projected to increase at a mid single digit percentage rate above 2010 levels, resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years. Similar to the relationship of operating margins from 2009 to 2010 discussed above, the expected operating margin decrease from 2010 to 2011 reflects the trend of Aeronautics performing more development and initial production work on the F-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the F-22 and F-16, even though sales are expected to increase in 2011 relative to 2010. 31 Table of Contents Electronic Systems Our Electronic Systems business segment manages complex programs and designs, develops, produces, and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide. The segment’s three lines of business are Mission Systems & Sensors (MS2), Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC), and Global Training & Logistics (GT&L). With such a broad portfolio of programs to provide products and services, many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules. Some of its more significant programs, including the THAAD system, the Aegis Weapon System, and the Littoral Combat Ship program, demonstrate the diverse products and services Electronic Systems provides. Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 14,363 $ 13,532 $ 12,803 Operating profit 1,712 1,660 1,583 Operating margin 11.9 % 12.3 % 12.4 % Backlog at year-end 23,200 23,100 23,500 Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 6% in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales increased in all three lines of business during the year. The $421 million increase at GT&L primarily was due to growth on readiness and stability operations, which partially was offset by lower volume on simulation & training programs. The $316 million increase at M&FC primarily was due to higher volume on tactical missile and air defense programs, which partially was offset by a decline in volume on fire control systems. The $94 million increase at MS2 mainly was due to higher volume on surface naval warfare, ship & aviation systems, and radar systems programs, which partially was offset by lower volume on undersea warfare programs. Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. Sales increases in M&FC and GT&L more than offset a decline in MS2. The $429 million increase in sales at M&FC primarily was due to growth on tactical missile programs and fire control systems. The $355 million increase at GT&L primarily was due to growth on simulation and training activities and readiness and stability operations. The increase in simulation and training also included sales from the first quarter 2009 acquisition of Universal Systems and Technology, Inc. The $55 million decrease at MS2 mainly was due to lower volume on ship & aviation systems and undersea warfare programs, which partially were offset by higher volume on radar systems and surface naval warfare programs. Operating profit for the segment increased by 3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Operating profit increases at M&FC and GT&L more than offset a decline at MS2. The $73 million increase at M&FC mainly was due to higher volume and improved performance on certain tactical missile programs and higher volume on air defense programs. The $23 million increase at GT&L primarily was attributable to higher volume on readiness and stability operations and improved performance on simulation and training programs. These increases more than offset declines due to lower volume and performance on other logistics programs and the absence in 2010 of a benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2009 from favorably resolving a contract matter at simulation & training programs. The $44 million decrease in operating profit at MS2 mainly was due to lower volume and performance on undersea warfare programs and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on surface naval warfare programs in 2010. These declines partially were offset by higher volume and improved performance on ship & aviation systems and radar systems programs in 2010. Operating profit for the segment increased by 5% in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, increases in operating profit at M&FC and GT&L more than offset declines at MS2. Operating profit increased $110 million at M&FC mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on fire control systems and tactical missile programs. The increase in operating profit of $34 million at GT&L primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance on simulation and training programs and readiness and stability operations. Additionally, the increase included a benefit recognized in 2009 from favorably resolving a simulation and training contract matter. These increases partially were offset by lower volume and performance on other logistics programs. There was a $67 million decrease in operating profit at MS2, which primarily was attributable to lower volume on ship & aviation programs and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on ship & aviation systems and undersea warfare programs in 2009 compared to 2008. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily from increased orders for air defense and tactical missile programs at M&FC and readiness and stability operations at GT&L. These increases partially were offset by higher sales volume on ship & aviation systems and surface naval warfare programs at MS2. Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 32 Table of Contents 2008 due to the U.S. Government’s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter Program at MS2, which resulted in a $985 million reduction. This decline more than offset increased orders on air defense and tactical missile programs at M&FC and simulation and training activities at GT&L. We expect Electronic Systems’ sales to decline in 2011 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2010. The decline primarily is due to our completion of the persistent threat detection system (PTDS) program in 2010, coupled with the delayed timing of awards such as the Littoral Combat Ship and certain missile defense contracts. We expect the decline to be partially offset by growth in readiness and stability contracts. Operating profit is expected to decline in line with sales, with operating margins expected to be similar to those in 2010. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides management services, Information Technology (IT) solutions, and advanced technology expertise across a broad spectrum of applications to U.S. Government and other customers. The segment operates in the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence lines of business. IS&GS’ key programs and activities include the En-Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) program, the Airborne Maritime Fixed Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program, the Hanford Mission Support contract, and the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS 2010) program. The DRIS 2010 program substantially was completed in 2010. IS&GS’ programs also include a large number of IDIQ and task order types of contracts across each of its lines of business. IS&GS’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 9,959 $ 9,608 $ 9,069 Operating profit 890 895 919 Operating margin 8.9 % 9.3 % 10.1 % Backlog at year-end 9,700 10,600 11,500 Net sales for IS&GS increased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales increased in Civil and Defense but declined in Intelligence during the year. Civil increased $437 million principally due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services. Defense sales increased $20 million primarily due to higher volume on mission and combat systems activities. The $106 million decline in Intelligence programs mainly was due to lower volume on security solutions. Net sales for IS&GS increased by 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. Sales increased in all three lines of business during the year. Net sales at Civil increased by $324 million principally due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services. Defense sales increased $192 million primarily due to higher volume on mission and combat systems activities. The $23 million increase in Intelligence mainly was due to higher volume on security solutions. Operating profit for the segment decreased by 1% in 2010 compared to 2009. For the year, operating profit declines in Defense more than offset an increase in Civil, while operating profit at Intelligence essentially was unchanged. The $27 million decrease in operating profit at Defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010. The $19 million increase in Civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services. Operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit declines in Civil and Intelligence partially were offset by growth in Defense. The decrease of $29 million in Civil’s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit of $27 million at Intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in Defense’s operating profit of $29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems. The decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at Civil, including volume associated with the DRIS 2010 program, and mission and combat system programs at Defense. Backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to U.S. Government’s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) contract at Defense, which resulted in a $1.6 billion reduction in orders. This decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at Civil. We expect IS&GS will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010. This decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the DRIS 2010 program. Operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume, while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years. 33 Table of Contents Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems, including activities related to the planned replacement of the Space Shuttle. Government satellite programs include the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), the Global Positioning Satellite III (GPS III) system, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R). Strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program. Space transportation includes the NASA Orion program and, through ownership interests in two joint ventures, expendable launch services (United Launch Alliance, or ULA) and Space Shuttle processing activities for the U.S. Government (United Space Alliance, or USA). The Space Shuttle is expected to complete its final flight mission in 2011 and our involvement with its launch and processing activities will end at that time. Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 8,246 $ 8,654 $ 8,027 Operating profit 972 972 953 Operating margin 11.8 % 11.2 % 11.9 % Backlog at year-end 17,800 16,800 17,900 Net sales for Space Systems decreased by 5% in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales declined in all three lines of business during the year. The $253 million decrease in Space Transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank, commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs, which partially were offset by higher volume on the Orion program. There were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009. Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) sales declined $147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs. The $8 million sales decline in Satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites, which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities. There was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009. Net sales for Space Systems increased 8% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, sales growth at Satellites and Space Transportation offset a decline in S&DMS. The sales growth of $707 million in Satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities, which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities. There was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008. The increase in sales of $21 million in Space Transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the Orion program, which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle’s external tank program. There was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008. S&DMS’ sales decreased by $102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs, which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. Operating profit for the segment was unchanged for 2010 compared to 2009. Growth in Space Transportation’s operating profit was more than offset by a decline in Satellites’ operating profit. S&DMS operating profit was relatively unchanged between periods. The $21 million increase in Space Transportation mainly was attributable to higher equity earnings on the ULA and USA joint ventures and higher volume on the Orion program, which partially were offset by lower volume on the space shuttle’s external tank program. Satellites’ operating profit decreased $23 million primarily due to lower volume and performance on commercial satellite programs, which partially was offset by higher volume and improved performance on government satellite programs in 2010. Equity earnings represented 27% of operating profit at Space Systems in 2010, compared to 22% in 2009. Operating profit for the segment increased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008. During the year, operating profit growth at Satellites more than offset declines at Space Transportation and S&DMS. In Satellites, the operating profit increase of $88 million mainly was due to higher volume on government satellite activities, which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities. The decrease of $46 million in Space Transportation’s operating profit mainly was attributable to the absence in 2009 of a benefit recognized in 2008 from the successful negotiations of a terminated commercial launch vehicle contract, lower volume on the space shuttle external tank program, and lower equity earnings in 2009 on the ULA joint venture. The decrease in S&DMS’ operating profit of $19 million primarily was attributable to a lower volume on defensive missile programs and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments in 2009 compared to 2008 on strategic missile programs. Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems, which includes ULA and USA, represented 22% of the segment’s operating profit in 2009 compared to 24% in 2008. 34 Table of Contents Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on government satellite programs in Satellites and strategic missile programs in S&DMS, which more than offset higher sales volume compared to new orders on the Orion program in Space Transportation in 2010. The decrease in backlog during 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to declines in orders and higher sales volume on the Orion program in Space Transportation and on government satellite programs in Satellites. We expect Space Systems’ sales for 2011 will be comparable with the 2010 results. Sales are expected to decline due to the end of our production of the external tank for the space shuttle, offset by growth in satellite activities. Segment operating profit is expected to be down slightly primarily due to lower anticipated levels of equity earnings from our ownership interest in USA, which provides processing activities for the space shuttle. USA’s activities will be winding down as the space shuttle’s last flight will be in 2011. Segment operating margin is expected to slightly decline due to the lower equity earnings. Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the components of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net, including the CAS expense that is included as expense in the segments’ operating results, the related FAS pension expense, and the resulting FAS/CAS pension adjustment. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 VESP and other charges (a) $ (220 ) $ — $ — Other unallocated Corporate income (expense), net: FAS/CAS pension adjustment: FAS pension expense (1,442 ) (1,036 ) (462 ) Less: CAS expense (988 ) (580 ) (590 ) FAS/CAS pension adjustment – income (expense) (454 ) (456 ) 128 Other items not considered in segment operating performance — — 193 Stock compensation expense (168 ) (154 ) (155 ) Other, net (137 ) (79 ) (5 ) Total other unallocated Corporate income (expense), net (759 ) (689 ) 161 $ (979 ) $ (689 ) $ 161 (a) Includes the $178 million charge associated with the VESP for qualifying company executives we announced in July 2010 and the $42 million charge associated with the MS2 facilities consolidation (see Note 3). The approximate amounts of the VESP attributable to our business segments were as follows: Aeronautics – $25 million; Electronic Systems – $38 million; IS&GS – $42 million; and Space Systems – $41 million. The remaining $32 million was attributable to Corporate. FAS pension expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009, and in 2009 compared to 2008, due to the 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate each year and continued amortization of the actuarial losses incurred in 2008 as a result of the significant negative return on plan assets compared to our 8.5% long-term rate of return assumption (see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans”). Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management’s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by GAAP, such as the charges related to the VESP and the MS2 consolidation of facilities in 2010 (see Note 3); gains or losses from divestitures; the effects of legal settlements; Corporate costs not allocated to the business segments; and other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The charges related to the VESP and the MS2 consolidation of facilities are presented together on a separate line item in the table above. On a combined basis, these items decreased net earnings for 2010 by $143 million ($.38 per share). All such items for 2008 are included in “Other items not considered in segment operating performance” in the table above and consisted of: $108 million related to the recognition of a deferred gain recorded in connection with the sale of Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS) and $85 million related to the elimination or reserves associated with various land sales (see Note 3). On a combined basis, these items increased net earnings for 2008 by $126 million ($.31 per share). In 2009, there were no such items included in unallocated Corporate income (expense), net. The change in the “Other, net” component of unallocated Corporate income (expense), net, between the periods primarily was due to higher expense associated with a number of Corporate activities. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Cash Flows Our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the changing economic and market conditions over the past few years. We continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments. We have generated strong operating cash flows which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and postretirement benefit plan funding. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. We issued $728 million of notes in exchange for $611 million of our then outstanding debt securities in 2010 (see Note 10), $1.5 billion of debt securities in 2009, and $500 million of debt securities in 2008. We expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, as discussed under Capital Structure, Resources, and Other. We have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately 60% of the revenues we recorded in 2010, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast to cost-reimbursable contracts, for fixed-price contracts we generally do not bill until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The U.S. Government recently has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating consideration for different payment terms on contracts, such as performance-based payments. The use of progress payments could delay the collection of receivables on certain of our contracts in future periods. Fixed-price contracts represented approximately 40% of the revenues we recorded in 2010. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2010 and those planned for 2011 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and information technology (IT). Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. We have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business, including capital expenditures and independent research and development, repurchased shares, increased our dividends, made selective acquisitions of businesses, and managed our debt levels. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information and the subsequent discussion provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,547 $ 3,173 $ 4,421 Net Cash Used for Investing Activities (319 ) (1,518 ) (907 ) Net Cash Used for Financing Activities (3,363 ) (1,476 ) (3,938 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $374 million to $3,547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $570 million as discussed below, and $187 million related to lower net income tax payments, as compared to 2009. Partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan. This reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $758 million as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in the CAS costs recovered on our contracts. Operating working capital accounts consists of receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. The improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009, and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of 36 Table of Contents costs incurred balances compared to 2009. These improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems business areas. The increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at Space Systems and air mobility programs at Aeronautics, partially offset by a decrease on various programs at Electronic Systems. The decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1,248 million to $3,173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $1,373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $147 million. Partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $319 million. The decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the MS2 and GT&L lines of business at Electronic Systems and an increase in inventories on Combat Aircraft programs at Aeronautics, which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on Government Satellite programs at Space Systems and the timing of accounts payable activities. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – The majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $820 million in 2010, $852 million in 2009, and $926 million in 2008. We expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. Amounts paid in 2010 of $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. We paid $435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities, compared with $233 million in 2008. In 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of EIG, net of $17 million in transaction costs (see Note 2). There were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008. During 2010, we increased our short-term investments by $171 million compared to an increase of $279 million in 2009. Financing Activities Share activity and dividends – During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we repurchased 33.0 million, 24.9 million, and 29.0 million shares of our common stock for $2,483 million, $1,851 million, and $2,931 million. Of the shares we repurchased in 2010, 0.9 million shares for $63 million were repurchased in December but settled and were paid for in January 2011. In October 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time, up to an authorized amount of $3.0 billion (see Note 12). Under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. We repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares under the program for $776 million, and as of December 31, 2010, there remained $2,224 million available for additional share repurchases. In connection with their approval of the new share repurchase program, our Board terminated our previous share repurchase program. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $59 million, $40 million, and $250 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 1.4 million shares, 1.0 million shares, and 4.7 million shares during the respective periods. Shareholders were paid cash dividends of $969 million in 2010, $908 million in 2009, and $737 million in 2008. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years. We declared quarterly dividends of: $.63 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2010 and $.75 per share for the last quarter; $.57 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2009 and $.63 per share for the last quarter; and $.42 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2008 and $.57 per share for the last quarter. Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – In connection with the debt exchange completed in May 2010 (see Note 10), we paid a total of $47 million for a portion of the premium associated with the transaction and related expenses incurred with third parties. We issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in 2009 (see Note 10) and $500 million of long-term notes in 2008. There were no repayments of long-term debt in 2010, and there are no scheduled maturity payments due prior 37 Table of Contents to 2013. In 2009, we paid $242 million in repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities. In 2008, we paid a total of $1.0 billion representing the principal amount of our floating rate convertible debentures that were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed. We also paid another $103 million during 2008 related to other repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities. Capital Structure, Resources, and Other At December 31, 2010, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and short-term investments of $516 million. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $5.0 billion. As of the end of 2010, our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes and debentures. We issued $728 million of new 5.72% Notes due 2040 (the New Notes) in May 2010 in exchange for $611 million of our then outstanding debt securities (see Note 10). We paid a premium of $158 million, of which $117 million was in the form of New Notes and $41 million was paid in cash, which was recorded as a discount and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the New Notes using the effective interest method. The New Notes are included on our Balance Sheet net of the unamortized discount. In November 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering (see Note 10), $900 million of which are due in 2019 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.25%, and $600 million of which are due in 2039 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 5.50%. Our stockholders’ equity was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $421 million from December 31, 2009. The decrease primarily was due to the repurchase of 33.0 million common shares for $2.5 billion; the payment of $969 million of dividends during the year; and adjustments related to our postretirement benefit plans at December 31 (see Note 11) which on a net basis increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $430 million. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $2.9 billion and employee stock activity of $520 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase programs, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $1.9 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. At December 31, 2010, we had in place with a group of banks a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2012. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility during the year ended December 31, 2010. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank defined Base Rate. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets, and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to our postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility agreement. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2010. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market, and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Return on invested capital (ROIC) declined by 200 basis points during 2010 to 17.9%. The decline was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.5 billion in debt securities in November 2009 and lower net earnings in 2010 compared to 2009. We define ROIC as net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders’ equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders’ equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans. We believe that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations. We use ROIC as one of the inputs in our evaluation of multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure. We also use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans. 38 Table of Contents ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. ROIC for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was calculated as follows: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings $ 2,926 $ 3,024 $ 3,217 Interest expense (multiplied by 65%) 1 224 200 216 Return $ 3,150 $ 3,224 $ 3,433 Average debt 2, 5 $ 5,032 $ 4,054 $ 4,346 Average equity 3, 5 3,904 3,155 8,236 Average benefit plan adjustments 4, 5 8,650 8,960 3,256 Average invested capital $ 17,586 $ 16,169 $ 15,838 Return on invested capital 17.9 % 19.9 % 21.7 % 1 Represents after-tax interest expense utilizing the federal statutory rate of 35%. Interest expense is added back to net earnings as it represents the return to debt holders. Debt is included as a component of average invested capital. 2 Debt consists of long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings (if any). 3 Equity includes non-cash adjustments, primarily related to benefit plan adjustments as discussed in Note 4 below. 4 Average benefit plan adjustments reflect the cumulative value of entries identified in our Statements of Stockholders’ Equity related to adjustments to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans. The total of annual benefit plan adjustments to equity were: 2010 – $(430) million; 2009 – $495 million; and 2008 – $(7,253) million. As these entries are recorded in the fourth quarter, the value added back to our average equity in a given year is the cumulative impact of all prior year entries plus 20% of the current year entry value. The cumulative impact of benefit plan adjustments through December 31, 2007 was $(1,806) million. 5 Yearly averages are calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2010, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,524 $ — $ 650 $ — $ 4,874 Interest payments 5,913 332 648 600 4,333 Other liabilities 2,483 446 400 287 1,350 Operating lease obligations 1,299 300 416 259 324 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 22,461 12,212 7,501 1,917 831 Capital expenditures 237 124 113 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 37,917 $ 13,414 $ 9,728 $ 3,063 $ 11,712 (a) The total amount of long-term debt excludes the unamortized discount of $505 million (see Note 10). Generally, our long-term debt obligations are subject to, along with other things, compliance with certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements. Interest payments include interest related to the outstanding debt through maturity. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2010. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and business acquisition agreements. Obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of obligations for sites at which we are performing remediation activities, excluding amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party. The amounts also include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 9). We estimated the timing of tax payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities and resolution of issues pending in the Internal Revenue Service Appeals Division. 39 Table of Contents Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $20.2 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $9.3 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics segment, some of which extend through 2025. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2010 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We historically have not been required to pay material penalties. In connection with our ownership of United Launch Alliance, L.L.C. (ULA), we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) each committed to provide up to $200 million in financial support to ULA, as required, until at least December 1, 2011. We had a revolving credit agreement with ULA in place through September 26, 2010. No amounts were drawn on the credit agreement. On September 27, 2010, ULA entered into with a group of banks its own $400 million revolving credit agreement which expires in October 2013. At the same time, the revolving credit agreement we and Boeing had in place was terminated. The new revolving credit agreement satisfies Boeing’s and our commitment to provide financial support of up to $200 million each to ULA, so long as the total amount of the new agreement remains at $400 million or above until at least December 1, 2011. We and Boeing have received distributions totaling $232 million each which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing, and ULA whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity to meet its obligations, so that we will not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, we, Boeing, and ULA have cross-indemnifications in place with ULA related to financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds, or foreign exchange contracts) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2010, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities. 40 Table of Contents We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on certain of our contracts. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2010, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than 1 Year (a) Years 2 and 3 (a) Years 4 and 5 (a) After 5 Years (a) Standby letters of credit $ 2,742 $ 2,388 $ 194 $ 130 $ 30 Surety bonds 403 398 5 — — Guarantees 1,030 1 59 180 790 Total commitments $ 4,175 $ 2,787 $ 258 $ 310 $ 820 (a) Approximately $2,190 million, $40 million, $6 million, and $3 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “Years 2 and 3,” “Years 4 and 5,” and “After 5 Years” periods, and approximately $40 million of surety bonds in the “Less Than 1 Year” period, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $267 million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $1.8 billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Approximately 85% of the $1.0 billion in third-party guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2010 related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we are a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of our joint venture partners. We evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities, and credit quality of potential joint venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. We believe our current joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2010, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Approximately 80% of our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development, and production activities (also referred to as DD&P contracts) which we account for under the percentage-of-completion (POC) accounting model. The POC model requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design, development, or production activities which we account for under the services accounting model. We consider the nature of our contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the accounting method for a particular contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both DD&P activities and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 60% of our total net sales over the last three years, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee (which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts) and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical, and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. 41 Table of Contents Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 35% of our total net sales over the last three years, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales over the last three years, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Design, Development, and Production Contracts We record net sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price DD&P contracts. Sales are recorded on time-and-materials contracts as the work is performed based on agreed-upon hourly rates and allowable costs. The POC method for DD&P contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required on DD&P contracts, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Award fees and incentives, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on DD&P contracts. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. For contract change orders, claims, or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. We have accounting policies in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts. Accounting for DD&P contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance), and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes in our accounting for DD&P contracts, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all DD&P contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2010 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $250 million. Services Contracts For cost-reimbursable contracts for services that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, except for award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the 42 Table of Contents recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. The majority of our service contracts are in our IS&GS segment. 2011 Change in Revenue Recognition on Service Contracts with the U.S. Government Effective January 1, 2011, we changed our methodology for recognizing net sales for service contracts with the U.S. Government. We will recognize sales on those contracts using the POC method similar to our DD&P contracts as described above. As such, we expect that over 95% of our consolidated net sales will be recognized using the POC method. We believe the POC method is preferable, as consistent revenue recognition application across all contracts with the U.S. Government better reflects the underlying economics of those contracts and aligns our financial reporting with others in our industry. Beginning with our first quarter 2011 financial statements, all prior periods presented will be retrospectively adjusted to apply the new method of accounting. The effect of this change is expected to be less than one percent of net sales and segment operating profit in 2011, and was not material to prior periods. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling, and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 11). The impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or liability on our Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan as determined under GAAP. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations. The primary year-end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans; the rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. We use judgment in 43 Table of Contents reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider past and current market conditions, and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We selected 5.5% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2010, compared to 5.875% at the end of 2009 and 6.125% at the end of 2008. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. We concluded that 8.50% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2010, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2009. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future. Our stockholders’ equity decreased on a net basis by $430 million at December 31, 2010 due to two noncash, after-tax adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the annual remeasurement of our postretirement benefit plans. The first adjustment decreased stockholders’ equity by $983 million and was driven by the decline in the discount rate used to calculate postretirement benefit liabilities, partially offset by the effects of the approximate 13% actual return on plan assets resulting from market conditions in 2010. The amount primarily represents net actuarial gains and losses resulting from the differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions, which will be amortized to expense in future periods. The second adjustment increased stockholders’ equity by $553 million and represents the recognition in earnings of amounts which were recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity in prior years. These amounts primarily related to investment losses in 2008 on the assets held in trust to support our postretirement benefit plans, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 (each as compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption). We also expect that our 2011 pension expense will increase to $1,825 million as compared with 2010 pension expense of $1,442 million, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, together with the net effect of the recognition of the 2008 investment losses, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 as discussed above. For a discussion of changes in pension expense over the past three years, see the discussion under the caption “Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net.” The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.5% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2010, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2010 by over $1.1 billion, which would have resulted in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $750 million. If the 5.5% discount rate at December 31, 2010 that was used to compute 2011 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2011 would be lower or higher by approximately $100 million. Funding Considerations The pension plan funding legislation enacted in 2006, known as the Pension Protection Act, had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions most companies were required to pay, beginning in 2008. The new funding requirements for large U.S. defense contractors like us were delayed until the earlier of 2011 or the year in which required changes to the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rules became effective. The legislation also required the CAS Board to modify its pension accounting rules by 2010 to better align the recovery of pension contributions on U.S. Government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements. To date, the CAS Board has not published final changes to its pension accounting rules, and therefore, we currently do not expect that the revised rules will be effective until after 2011. The Pension Protection Act will become applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011. 44 Table of Contents CAS rules are a major factor we consider in determining our total pension funding and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. Funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and are recognized in our net sales. The amount of funding required under CAS for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for 2010, and therefore the amount included in our segments’ operating results for the year, was $988 million. For 2011, we expect the funding required under CAS will be about $900 million. Additional funding requirements computed under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules, as well as discretionary payments, are considered to be prepayments under the CAS rules to the extent the amounts exceed CAS funding requirements. As noted above, the results of operations of our segments include pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. Because our 2011 FAS pension expense is estimated to be $1,825 million and our 2011 CAS pension expense is expected to be $900 million, we estimate that the 2011 FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be $925 million, compared to $454 million in 2010. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment is included in unallocated Corporate income (expense), net for purposes of our segment reporting. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we made discretionary contributions of $2,240 million, $1,482 million, and $109 million related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We expect to make contributions of $1.3 billion related to those plans in 2011. We also may review options for further contributions in 2011. Our inability to allocate the accelerated funding required under the Pension Protection Act in the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts in the period during which the funding is required will have the effect of increasing the amount of the FAS/CAS pension expense that is charged to earnings in 2011 and negatively affecting our cash from operations. We anticipate recovering approximately $900 million as CAS cost during 2011 as compared to our estimated funding of $1.3 billion, with the remainder being recoverable in future years. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. At the end of 2010, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $935 million. We have recorded assets totaling $810 million at December 31, 2010 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and assets in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We record a liability when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred for the amount within the range that we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or, in cases where no amount within the range is better than another, an amount at the low end of the range. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). In January 2011, both the EPA and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment announced plans to regulate two chemicals, perchlorate and hexavalent chromium, to a level that is expected to be substantially lower than the 45 Table of Contents existing standard established in California. The rulemaking process is a lengthy one and may take one or more years to complete. If a substantially lower standard is adopted, we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental asset and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding assets would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as an asset with the remainder charged to operations. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill Our goodwill at December 31, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $9.6 billion and $9.9 billion. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. Our annual testing date is October 1. Performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value. We consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires significant judgment. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. 46 Table of Contents We completed our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2010 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and, as such, no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term, as their fair value is significantly greater than their carrying value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard which revised its accounting guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The standard relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the individual deliverables, thereby affecting the timing of revenue recognition. Also, the standard expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The standard will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2011, and will apply prospectively to certain multiple-element arrangements with non-U.S. Government customers entered into or materially modified after the adoption date. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material effect on our financial results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments was approximately $6.2 billion, compared with a carrying value of $5.5 billion, excluding the $505 million unamortized discount. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our foreign currency exchange contracts, the majority of which qualify for hedge accounting treatment, hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies. Related gains and losses on these contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current period earnings. The aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion. There were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the net fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding was not material (see Note 15). We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a Rabbi Trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2010, investments in the Rabbi Trust totaled $843 million and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other assets. The Rabbi Trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. Changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in other non-operating income (expense), net. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded earnings totaling $56 million related to the increase in the value of the Rabbi Trust assets. We also contributed $49 million to the Rabbi Trust in 2010. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the Rabbi Trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in unallocated Corporate costs. The current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our Balance Sheet in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes, and the non-current portion of the liability is on our Balance Sheet in other liabilities. The resulting change in the value of the liabilities has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded expense of $41 million related to the increase in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:37.006477
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2011, 82% of our $46.5 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 17% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology, including cyber security. We have four business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on core program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing more security capability into the hands of our customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our U.S. Government customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in a disciplined manner with a focus on international and adjacent markets. Finally, we are focused on cost reduction, through actions such as our workforce reductions in 2011 and programs like our Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP) and facility reduction initiatives in 2010, to further enhance the value of our products and services. We expect a slight decline in our 2012 consolidated net sales and segment operating profit as compared to 2011, as our customers prepare to meet new security challenges without the benefit of increased resources. Our 2012 segment operating margin is expected to remain above 11%. Despite the challenges we face, we have a strong balance sheet and we expect to generate strong operating cash flows, which will allow us to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, invest in our people so that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to be successful in this environment, and to return at least 50% of free cash flow1 to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities The U.S. Government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. The Administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities in a greatly constrained fiscal environment imposed by the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Act), which reduces defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period starting in fiscal year 2012. Absent a significant redress of the structural disconnect between revenues and expenditures that can only be addressed through major tax and mandatory spending program reforms, it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for several years. Although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year, the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. The possibility remains, however, that one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the Administration’s continuing assessment of priorities. Notably, should Congress and the Administration fail to change or delay a pending sequestration of appropriations in fiscal year 2013 imposed by the Budget Act, our customers could see their budgets 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less the amount identified as expenditures for property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal-use software as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 22 Table of Contents dramatically reduced across the board in January 2013 with an attendant impact upon procurement of products and services. While the impact of sequestration is yet to be determined, automatic across-the-board budget cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten-year $487 billion top line reduction already reflected in the defense funding over a ten-year period, with a $52 billion reduction occurring in the government’s fiscal year 2013. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts in sequestration would have significant consequences to our business and industry. There would be disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facilities closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, directly undermining a key provision of the new security strategy, which is to preserve the industrial base. The Administration’s spending priorities were released on February 13, 2012 with the submission of the President’s Budget Request for fiscal year 2013. The government’s 2013 fiscal year runs from October 2012 to September 2013. Every year, Congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the President’s annual budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which then require final Presidential approval. The outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business. Department of Defense Business The passage of the Budget Act signaled the end of ten years of growth in the DoD base budget and imposed specific caps on security and non-security spending beginning in fiscal year 2013. The fiscal year 2013 request of $525 billion for the DoD base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending levels imposed by the Budget Act and is consistent with its caps on discretionary spending. The fiscal year 2013 request represents a decline of about 1% below the fiscal year 2012 DoD baseline appropriated level of $531 billion. Preliminary insights into national security funding priorities for fiscal year 2013 and beyond were revealed on January 26, 2012 by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, which were consistent with the fiscal year 2013 budget request. Specifically, the defense spending proposal estimates DoD base budgets that are essentially flat in real terms from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. In prior years, the Administration has requested and Congress has provided funds for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations, through a separate Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding outside of the base DoD budget. The OCO funding for fiscal year 2012 totaled $115 billion, and the Administration has requested $88 billion for fiscal year 2013. This significant reduction reflects the completion of U.S. military operations in Iraq in 2011. Our net sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests, and therefore, we continue to focus our attention on the DoD’s base budget for support and funding of our programs. In December 2011, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2012 to finance all U.S. Government activities through September 30, 2012, the end of its fiscal year. This full year method of financing eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procurement of products and services that characterized the first quarter of the government’s fiscal year 2012 when the operations of the federal government were financed through a series of continuing resolution temporary funding measures. As we begin 2012, presidential election year activities will likely mean a shortened session for Congress that will have to address the annual spending bills but also broader and more contentious policy issues associated with sequestration and tax policy. Given the complexity and sensitivity of these issues, Congress may resort to returning for a lame duck session after the November 2012 elections in order to deal with these more contentious issues. The fiscal year 2013 budget proposal reflects the Administration’s new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending levels imposed by the Budget Act. Despite the reduced defense spending levels in the President’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continue to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD and our programs are well supported in the fiscal year 2013 budget request. This view was strongly supported by the Secretary of Defense’s initial public release of elements of the fiscal year 2013 defense budget request on January 26, 2012. For example, the budget supports continuation of all three variants of the F-35 and still maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. Government as last year, although ramp up of production will be slowed due to budgetary constraints in the near term to allow for more testing and to minimize design changes impacting production aircraft. Additionally, the Secretary’s preliminary release specifically cited continued support for systems where we are the prime contractor or a major subcontractor such as the Global Positioning Satellite program, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system, the Space-Based Infrared System, Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, DDG-51 AEGIS destroyer, and continued operation of the U-2 manned ISR aircraft. 23 Table of Contents Given the Administration’s emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiencies in the management and operations of DoD, the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cyber security, all appear to continue to be national priorities. To address these priorities, we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these areas, diversifying our business, and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, rotary wing aviation, and land vehicles. Our products are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air, and space-based missile defense, including the Aegis Combat System, the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile program, and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) transportable defensive missile system. Even as future quantities may be adjusted to reflect reduced government resources for defense, we continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Javelin, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and Q-53 (formerly EQ-36) radar systems, and the Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS). We also have unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. We have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the DoD’s information technology systems. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost-effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers, and for improving global supply chain management. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As with the DoD, all other departments and agencies were impacted by the Budget Act. For fiscal year 2013 there is a separate non-security discretionary spending cap applied to all non-DoD entities that were not included under the security cap. The result would be that budgets for fiscal year 2013 and beyond will be reduced further below last year’s estimates. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance, and enterprise solutions. We believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions in order to reduce costs of operations, but at a slower pace in the near term. Consistent with our DoD business, more affordable logistics and sustainment, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cyber security all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. The continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. Other Business Considerations International Business We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. We conduct business with foreign governments primarily through Aeronautics and Electronic Systems. Our international sales are comprised of FMS through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II, while other countries such as Israel and Japan have selected the F-35 as their next generation combat aircraft. We expect the first international deliveries of the F-35 to begin in 2012. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 26 customers worldwide, including recent orders from Iraq and Oman, with 54 follow-on buys from 15 countries. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft’s international footprint with customers in 15 countries. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for the U.S., Norway, Canada, and Taiwan’s P-3 fleet. 24 Table of Contents With regard to the Aegis Combat System, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea, Norway, and Australia. The system also has been selected to be used as a ground-based missile defense system in Europe, referred to as “Aegis Ashore.” This segment has contracts with the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on Halifax class frigates. The new Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is also generating interest from potential international customers. Electronic Systems also produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE entered into a FMS agreement with the U.S. Government for the first international sale of the THAAD missile defense system, with other countries having expressed interest. In 2011, the Commonwealth of Australia entered into a FMS agreement for the first international sale of the MH-60R helicopter, for which we are responsible for integrating the common cockpit avionics suite, which marks the first ever purchase of an MH-60R helicopter outside of the U.S., and we also received an order to upgrade the United Kingdom’s Warrior fighting vehicles. To the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries, other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries, and the potential for deterioration of political relations. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of multiple contracts. Under our customer’s acquisition strategy, the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract will be performed concurrently with the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is advantageous in complex programs to test airplanes, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. Accordingly, we are performing the SDD contract concurrently with LRIP aircraft lots 2 through 6. The SDD portion of the F-35 program is expected to continue into 2017 and has approximately $530 million of fee remaining, only a minor portion of which has been tied to specific performance milestones to date. Any portion of the remaining fee that we or our partners receive will be dependent upon our customer’s evaluation of our progress on program milestones, most of which have yet to be determined by our customer. The current profit booking rate on the SDD contract contemplates that we will earn a portion of these outstanding award fees. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft quantities, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, executing flight tests, supplier and partner performance, software development, and receiving funding for the LRIP contracts on a timely basis. In 2011, both of the LRIP lot 1 aircraft and seven of the 12 LRIP lot 2 aircraft were delivered to the U.S. Government. We received additional funding for LRIP 5 and long lead funding for LRIP 6 in 2011. We now have 93 production aircraft on order. Although not exclusively related to the F-35 program, on October 4, 2010, the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA) withdrew its prior validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system (EVMS) at our Fort Worth, Texas location. EVMS is a tool for managing cost and schedule performance on complex programs. We understand that the DCMA has chosen to re-audit our EVMS system in 2012. The withdrawal of the prior validation and determination of compliance of the EVMS system has no impact on our internal controls over financial reporting. In January 2012, the Secretary of Defense removed the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter variant from “probation” as the STOVL variant completed highly successful initial sea trials aboard the USS Wasp and is demonstrating the kind of performance and maturity that is in line with the other two variants of the F-35. International interest in the F-35 continues to grow with two U.S. Government FMS customers to go along with our eight partner countries. In 2011, the Israeli government signed a letter of offer and acceptance with the U.S. Government for the procurement of F-35 aircraft and the Japanese Ministry of Defense selected the F-35 to be its next generation fighter. Israel and Japan are expected to be the first two countries to receive the F-35 aircraft through the U.S. Government FMS process. 25 Table of Contents Portfolio Shaping Activities Overview We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities, and through acquisition, divestiture, and internal realignment activities. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and equity investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services, or customer base, at attractive valuations. Acquisitions and Divestitures We used $649 million in 2011 for acquisition activities, including the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We have accounted for the acquisition of businesses under the acquisition method, which requires that all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisitions in 2011 primarily include QTC Holdings Inc. (QTC), which provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the U.S. Government, and Sim-Industries B.V., a commercial aviation simulation company. QTC is included within our IS&GS business segment, and Sim-Industries B.V. is included within our Electronic Systems business segment. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Statement of Earnings from the date of acquisition in the fourth quarter. During 2011, we committed to a plan to sell Savi Technology, Inc. (Savi), and we closed on the sale of Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE). In 2010, we closed on the sale of Enterprise Integration Group (EIG). For additional information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of design, development, and production (DD&P) contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis from continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. (In millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 2009 Operating Results (a) Net sales $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Cost of sales (42,795 ) (41,883 ) (39,720 ) Operating profit 3,980 4,049 4,367 Interest expense (354 ) (345 ) (308 ) Other non-operating income, net 5 74 123 Income tax expense (964 ) (1,164 ) (1,215 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 2,667 2,614 2,967 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (12 ) 264 6 Net earnings 2,655 2,878 2,973 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share (a) Continuing operations $ 7.85 $ 7.10 $ 7.63 Discontinued operations (.04 ) .71 .01 Total $ 7.81 $ 7.81 $ 7.64 (a) The amounts in the above table reflect, as appropriate, the change in our accounting for services contracts with the U.S. Government from the services accounting method to the percentage-of-completion method (Note 1) and the operating results of Savi as discontinued operations (Note 14). All prior period amounts included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect these changes. 26 Table of Contents The following provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations by focusing on key elements in our Statements of Earnings. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, and Space Systems business segments, and most of our services sales are generated in our Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Net Sales (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net Sales Products $ 36,925 $ 36,380 $ 35,689 Services 9,574 9,291 8,178 Total $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Approximately 95% of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting. Under the POC method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our “Discussion of Business Segments,” because, due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales. Net sales for 2011 were $46.5 billion, a $828 million or 2% increase over 2010 net sales of $45.7 billion. The increase was due to a $545 million or 1% increase in product sales and a $283 million or 3% increase in services sales. Net sales for 2010 were $45.7 billion, a $1.8 billion or 4% increase over 2009 net sales of $43.9 billion. The increase was due to a $691 million or 2% increase in product sales and a $1.1 billion or 14% increase in services sales. Product Sales Product sales at Aeronautics increased about $1.2 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production activities on the F-35 LRIP contracts, volume on C-130 programs (including eight additional C-130J aircraft deliveries), F-16 support activities and deliveries (two additional F-16 aircraft deliveries) and volume on C-5 programs (including one additional C-5M aircraft delivery) partially offset by lower volume on the F-22 program and F-35 SDD contract. Electronic Systems’ product sales increased approximately $60 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) and the LCS program partially offset by lower volume on certain ship and aviation programs, tactical missile programs (including Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)) and fire control programs. Product sales decreased at IS&GS in 2011 compared to 2010 by about $700 million primarily due to the absence of the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program that supported the 2010 U.S. census and a decline in activities on the Airborne Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program. Product sales at Space Systems declined about $60 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower sales on the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) program and the NASA External Tank program, due to the completion of the Space Shuttle program, partially offset by higher volume on fleet ballistic missile programs and commercial satellites. Product sales at Aeronautics increased about $1.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production volume on the F-35 LRIP contracts, activities on C-130 programs (including nine additional C-130J aircraft deliveries), and volume on C-5 programs (including one additional C-5M aircraft delivery) partially offset by lower volumes on the F-22 program, F-35 SDD contract and F-16 (including 11 fewer F-16 aircraft deliveries) program. Electronic Systems’ product sales increased approximately $125 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production on air defense programs (including PAC-3) and tactical missile programs (including Hellfire, MLRS, and JASSM) partially offset by lower sales on various underseas programs. IS&GS’ product sales were relatively unchanged between 2010 and 2009 as increasing activities on DRIS were offset by lower activities on many smaller programs. Product sales at Space Systems decreased about $460 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower volume on defensive missile systems, activities on the NASA External Tank program due to the wind down of the Space Shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities. There was one commercial satellite delivery in both 2010 and 2009, and there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009. 27 Table of Contents Services Sales Services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $165 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to growth on the Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS) program partially offset by lower volume on various other logistic and training services programs. Services sales at IS&GS increased approximately $155 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to activities on a number of smaller contracts. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $645 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to growth on various logistic and training programs and the start of the SOF CLSS program in the third quarter of 2010. IS&GS’ services sales increased about $310 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to activities on the Hanford Mission Support contract and numerous other services contracts at IS&GS. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative). For each of our contracts, we manage the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) or for services, the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts generally are bid and negotiated with our customers based on the mutual awareness of our estimated costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components, to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of sales Cost of product sales $ (32,968 ) $ (32,539 ) $ (31,643 ) % of product sales 89.3 % 89.4 % 88.7 % Cost of services sales (8,514 ) (8,382 ) (7,406 ) % of services sales 88.9 % 90.2 % 90.6 % Severance and other charges (136 ) (220 ) — Other unallocated corporate costs (1,177 ) (742 ) (671 ) Total $ (42,795 ) $ (41,883 ) $ (39,720 ) Due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our cost of product and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our “Discussion of Business Segments.” Cost of sales was $42.8 billion in 2011, a $912 million or 2% increase over 2010 cost of sales of $41.9 billion. The increase was due to a $429 million increase in cost of product sales, a $132 million increase in cost of services sales and a $435 million increase in other unallocated corporate costs, partially offset by a reduction in severance and other charges of $84 million as further discussed in the following sections. Cost of sales was $41.9 billion in 2010, a $2.2 billion or 5% increase over 2009 cost of sales of $39.7 billion. The increase was due to a $896 million increase in cost of product sales, a $976 million increase in cost of services sales, a $71 million increase in other unallocated corporate costs and an increase for severance and other charges of $220 million, as further discussed in the following sections. 28 Table of Contents Cost of Product Sales Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $1.1 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production volume on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales for Electronic Systems was relatively unchanged between 2011 and 2010. Cost of product sales at IS&GS decreased about $560 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the absence of the DRIS program and lower volume on the JTRS program. Cost of product sales decreased at Space Systems by about $120 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower volume on the NASA External Tank and Orion programs. Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $1.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production activities on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales at Electronic Systems increased about $115 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to volume on air defense and tactical missile programs. IS&GS’ cost of product sales were relatively unchanged between 2010 and 2009. Cost of product sales at Space Systems declined about $400 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower volume on various programs, including the NASA External Tank, and the absence of a commercial launch as compared to the prior year. The 0.70% increase in the percentage of cost of product sales relative to product sales in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily was due to the increased development and initial production work on the F-35 program and less work on mature programs, such as F-22 and F-16. Development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs. Cost of Services Sales Cost of services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $180 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to SOF CLSS. Cost of services sales at IS&GS decreased by about $55 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the retirement of risks during 2011 and the recognition of reserves on various programs in 2010. The 1.3% decrease in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily was due to the retirement risks and other factors on numerous programs at IS&GS, partially offset by volume on SOF CLSS, which provides a lower margin relative to other Electronic Systems programs. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Cost of services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $535 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to volume on various logistics activities, as well as the start of the SOF CLSS program. IS&GS’ cost of services sales increased approximately $325 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to volume on various service contracts, including the Hanford Mission Support contract. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Severance and other charges During 2011, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $136 million, net of state tax benefits. Of these severance charges, $49 million and $48 million related to our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and $39 million related to our IS&GS business segment and Corporate Headquarters. These charges reduced our net earnings in 2011 by $88 million ($.26 per share). These severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our Corporate Headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. The workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles, where several of our major programs are transitioning out of development and into production, and certain programs are ending. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. In 2010, we recorded a charge of $178 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the VESP. The charge, which included lump-sum special payments for qualifying executives, reduced our net earnings by $116 million ($.31 per share). The amounts of the VESP attributable to our business segments were $25 million at Aeronautics, $38 million at Electronic Systems, $42 million at IS&GS, and $41 million at Space Systems. The remaining $32 million was attributable to our Corporate Headquarters. Also, in 2010, we recorded a $42 million charge related to our decision to consolidate certain operations within our Electronic Systems business segment, including the closure of a facility in Eagan, Minnesota. This charge reduced our net earnings for 2010 by $27 million ($.07 per share). The majority of the charge was associated with the accrual of severance payments to employees, with the remainder associated with impairment of assets. We expect to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges, including the charge related to the VESP, in future periods through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers. While the VESP is expected to be recovered over several years, the other severance charges would typically be expected to be recovered within a one-year period. For example, Space Systems recovered most of its severance charge in the second half of 2011. 29 Table of Contents Other unallocated corporate costs Other unallocated corporate costs principally includes the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, stock compensation, and other corporate costs. These costs are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the costs of product and services sales (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these items). The $435 million increase between 2011 and 2010 primarily was attributable to an increase in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $468 million, which included increased FAS pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the decrease in the discount rate in 2011, together with the effect of the recognition of the 2008 investment losses, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 (each as compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption). For more information, see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans.” Other unallocated corporate costs increased $71 million between 2010 and 2009 primarily due to fluctuations in expense associated with a number of corporate activities. Changes in our cost of sales between periods were not material, except as described above. The period-over-period change in our cost of sales was due to the volume of costs resulting from production, deliveries of products, and/or services provided on our portfolio of contracts. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales that would have a material impact on our future operations. Operating Profit Our operating profit for 2011 was $4.0 billion, essentially unchanged from 2010. The increase in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment was offset by increases in operating profit in every business segment, a decrease in severance and other charges, and a decrease in other unallocated corporate costs attributable to various corporate activities. Our operating profit for 2010 was $4.0 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to operating profit of $4.4 billion in 2009. The decline in operating profit of $318 million primarily was attributable to the effects of severance and other charges, net of state tax benefits, of $220 million (Note 2). Interest Expense Interest expense for 2011 was $354 million, about the same as in 2010. Increased interest expense from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt late in the third quarter of 2011 partially was offset by the redemption of certain notes in the fourth quarter of 2011. Interest expense for 2010 was $345 million, or $37 million higher than 2009. The increase mainly was driven by interest expense on the $1.5 billion of long-term notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2009. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net was $5 million in 2011, compared to $74 million in 2010. The decrease primarily was due to premiums of $48 million on early extinguishments of debt (Note 9) and lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations in 2011. Other non-operating income, net was $74 million in 2010, compared to $123 million in 2009. The change between periods primarily reflects lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 26.5% for 2011, 30.8% for 2010, and 29.1% for 2009. These rates were lower than the statutory rate of 35% for all periods due to tax benefits for U.S. manufacturing activities, the deduction of dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the research and development (R&D) tax credit. The 2011 effective tax rate was affected by the completion by the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of its review of IRS Appeals’ resolution of certain adjustments related to tax years 2003-2008. As a result of completion of the review in April 2011, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $89 million in 2011. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 also included additional tax benefits related to U.S. manufacturing activities primarily due to an increase in 2011 and 2010 qualified production activity income and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing activity deduction rate from 6% to 9%. 30 Table of Contents The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the tax deduction for company-paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. As a result, we recorded additional income tax expense of $96 million in 2010. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected a reduction of income tax expense of $69 million primarily arising from the resolution of IRS examinations of the years 2005 through 2007 and 2008. The Administration’s recent proposal to lower the corporate tax rate would require us to reduce our deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation with a corresponding material, one-time increase to income tax expense; however, our income tax expense and payments would be reduced in subsequent years. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion ($7.85 per share) in 2011, $2.6 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2010, and $3.0 billion ($7.63 per share) in 2009. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share has benefitted from a significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program, partially offset by common stock issued under our stock-based compensation and defined contribution plans. Share repurchases of 31.8 million, 33.0 million, and 24.9 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009 represented 9%, 9%, and 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of each year. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Net earnings from discontinued operations included the operating results of Savi for all periods presented. Discontinued operations also included PAE for 2009, 2010, and through the date of its sale on April 4, 2011, and those of EIG for 2009 and through the date of its sale on November 22, 2010. We reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $12 million ($.04 per share) in 2011, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $264 million ($.71 per share) in 2010 and $6 million ($.01 per share) in 2009. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2011 included a net benefit of $40 million related to the decision to sell Savi, the principal driver of which is the recognition of a deferred tax asset for book and tax basis differences. A similar tax benefit of $15 million related to the sale of PAE was also recorded in 2011. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2010 included a gain, net of income taxes, of $184 million ($.50 per share) from the sale of EIG. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell PAE in 2010, we recorded net adjustments that increased 2010 earnings from discontinued operations by $73 million ($.20 per share). For additional information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The following table presents net sales and operating profit of our four business segments. Net sales exclude intersegment revenue, as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts. Operating profit of the business segments includes the equity earnings or losses from investees in which certain of our business segments hold equity interests, because the activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. Operating profit of the business segments excludes the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment discussed below; expense for certain stock-based compensation programs, including costs for stock options and restricted stock units; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as the severance charges in 2011 and the charges in 2010 related to the VESP and facilities consolidation within Electronic Systems (Note 2); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 14); the effects of legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to the business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. The items other than the charges related to severance, the VESP, and facilities consolidation are included in “Other unallocated corporate expense, net” in the following table which reconciles operating profit from the business segments to operating profit in our Statements of Earnings. The charges related to severance, the VESP, and facilities consolidation are presented together as a separate reconciling item. 31 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2011, we realigned an immaterial supply chain services business from our Aeronautics business segment to our Electronic Systems business segment. The realignment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The financial information in the following table has been reclassified to reflect this realignment. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 14,362 $ 13,109 $ 11,988 Electronic Systems 14,622 14,399 13,630 Information Systems & Global Solutions 9,381 9,921 9,599 Space Systems 8,134 8,242 8,650 Total $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Operating Profit Aeronautics $ 1,630 $ 1,498 $ 1,567 Electronic Systems 1,788 1,748 1,648 Information Systems & Global Solutions 874 814 874 Space Systems 989 968 967 Total business segments 5,281 5,028 5,056 Unallocated corporate expense: Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment: FAS pension expense (1,821 ) (1,442 ) (1,036 ) Less: CAS expense (899 ) (988 ) (580 ) Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment (a) (922 ) (454 ) (456 ) Severance and other charges (136 ) (220 ) — Stock compensation expense and other, net (b) (243 ) (305 ) (233 ) Total unallocated corporate expense, net (1,301 ) (979 ) (689 ) Total operating profit $ 3,980 $ 4,049 $ 4,367 (a) FAS pension expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010, and in 2010 compared to 2009, due to the decrease in the discount rate each year, together with the effect of the recognition of investment losses from 2008, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 (each as compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption). The segment operating profit includes pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be about $835 million in 2012. For more information, see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption “Postretirement Benefit Plans”). (b) The change in stock compensation expense and other, net between the periods primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with various corporate activities, none individually significant. The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $80.7 billion, $78.4 billion, and $77.3 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $55.1 billion at December 31, 2011. Our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for DD&P activities and for services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS conducted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as DD&P contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, under the POC method of accounting which represent approximately 95% of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts, which account for the majority of our net sales, provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the POC method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. 32 Table of Contents Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in net sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. For example, if the cost volume on a cost-reimbursement-type contract increased or decreased compared with a prior period, sales and operating profit for that contract also will be increased or decreased. Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on our POC contracts and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract. For example, improved conditions typically result from the retirement of risks on contracts. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. For example, if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost-reimbursable contract, the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs as well as previously incurred costs. Many of our contracts are multi-billion dollar contracts that span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs (for example, material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and costs aspects of the contract. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Aeronautics also provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification services for its aircraft. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130J Hercules, and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,362 $ 13,109 $ 11,988 Operating profit 1,630 1,498 1,567 Operating margin 11.3 % 11.4 % 13.1 % Backlog at year-end 30,500 27,500 26,800 Net sales for the Aeronautics segment increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $850 million for work performed on the F-35 LRIP contracts as production increased, higher volume of about $745 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (33 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010) and support activities, about $425 million for F-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries (22 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010), and approximately $90 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (two C-5M aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010). These increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $675 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program, which will continue to decline as production winds down with final deliveries expected to be completed in 2012, and lower net sales of about $155 million for the F-35 SDD contract as development work decreased. Net sales for the Aeronautics segment increased by $1.1 billion, or 9%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was due to additional volume from work performed on the F-35 LRIP contracts of approximately $1.6 billion, higher volume of about $690 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (25 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2010 as compared to 16 in 2009) and support activities, and higher volume on C-5 programs of about $115 million, including 33 Table of Contents delivery of the first C-5M. These increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately $660 million on the F-35 SDD contract, lower F-16 volume of approximately $340 million primarily due to a reduction of deliveries (20 F-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009), and lower volume on the F-22 program of $305 million as production continued to wind down. Operating profit for the Aeronautics segment increased $132 million, or 9%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to approximately $115 million of higher operating profit on C-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks, increased volume and risk retirements on F-16 programs of about $50 million and C-5 programs of approximately $20 million, and about $70 million due to risk retirements on other Aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011. These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on the F-22 program and F-35 SDD contract primarily due to lower volume and about $55 million on other programs, including F-35 LRIP, primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011, compared to 2010. Operating profit for the Aeronautics segment decreased by $69 million, or 4%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease primarily was attributable to a decline in operating profit on the F-22 program of about $75 million due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements as the production program winds down, lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements of approximately $45 million on the F-35 SDD contract, and a decline in operating profit of about $40 million on the F-16 program due to a reduction of deliveries. These decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and risk retirements on the F-35 LRIP contracts of approximately $100 million. The decrease in the Aeronautics segment’s operating margin from 2010 to 2009 reflects increased development and initial production work on the F-35 program and less work on more mature programs such as the F-22 and F-16. Development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs. Accordingly, while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009, operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the F-35 and C-5 programs, which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the C-130 program. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the C-130, F-35 and C-5 programs, which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the F-22 program in 2010. We expect that Aeronautics’ net sales in 2012 will be comparable with 2011. An increase in net sales on the F-35 LRIP contracts is expected to be mostly offset by a decline in volume on the F-22 production program due to completion of the production program with the last aircraft delivery in the first half of 2012. Operating profit is projected to decrease at a low single digit percentage range from 2011 levels, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Electronic Systems Our Electronic Systems business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea-based missile defense systems; ship systems integration; littoral combat ships; nuclear instrumentation and control systems for naval submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface warships; air and defense missile systems; air-to-ground precision strike weapons systems; tactical missiles; munitions; fire control and navigation systems for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; simulation and training services; and energy programs. Electronic Systems’ major programs include the Aegis Combat System, PAC-3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Apache Fire Control System, LCS, and SOF CLSS. We have classified Savi as discontinued operations (Note 14) and, therefore, financial information related to this business has been excluded from the segment information below. Electronic Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,622 $ 14,399 $ 13,630 Operating profit 1,788 1,748 1,648 Operating margin 12.2 % 12.1 % 12.1 % Backlog at year-end 24,900 23,400 23,000 Net sales for the Electronic Systems segment increased $223 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to higher volume on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) of about $420 million, logistics activities 34 Table of Contents of about $330 million related to the SOF CLSS program, which began late in the quarter ended September 26, 2010, and the LCS program of approximately $165 million. These increases partially were offset by a decline in volume of approximately $375 million for certain ship and aviation programs (primarily Maritime Patrol Aircraft and PTDS), about $200 million for various logistics and training services, and approximately $115 million for tactical missile and fire control programs. Net sales for the Electronic Systems segment increased by $769 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Contributing to the increases were higher volume of about $430 million on various training and logistics activities (including the SOF CLSS program), increased deliveries on tactical missile programs (including MLRS and JASSM) of approximately $250 million, increased volume on various surface naval warfare programs (the Aegis Combat System) of about $140 million, and higher volume of about $100 million on air defense programs (including PAC-3). These increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately $185 million on undersea warfare programs. Operating profit for the Electronic Systems segment increased $40 million, or 2%, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. Operating profit increased by about $60 million due to higher volume and retirement of risks on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) and approximately $35 million primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea warfare programs in 2010. These increases partially were offset by approximately $55 million of reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). Operating profit for the Electronic Systems segment increased by $100 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to volume and retirement of risk on various training and logistics services programs of about $50 million, approximately $65 million on tactical missiles programs (including MLRS and JASSM) due to volume and the retirement of risks, and about $40 million due to the retirement of risks on fire control programs. These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on undersea warfare programs due to lower volume and recognition of reserves. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to orders exceeding sales on air defense programs (including THAAD and PAC-3), partially offset by higher sales volume on various training and logistics activities and surface naval warfare programs. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily from increased orders for air defense and tactical missile programs and on various training and logistics services programs. These increases partially were offset by higher sales volume on ship and aviation systems and surface naval warfare programs. We expect Electronic Systems’ net sales for 2012 will be comparable with 2011. We expect flat to low single digit percentage growth in key programs such as the LCS, offset by a decline in volume on logistics and training services contracts. Operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2011 results. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides management services, Information Technology (IT) solutions, and advanced technology expertise across a broad spectrum of applications. IS&GS supports the needs of customers in human capital planning, data protection and sharing, cyber-security, financial services, health care, energy and environment, security, space exploration, biometrics, and transportation. IS&GS provides network-enabled situation awareness, delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications, and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS’ major programs include the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications contract, En-Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) contract, the Hanford Mission Support contract, and the National Science Foundation’s U.S. Antarctic Support program. We have classified PAE and EIG as discontinued operations (Note 14) and, therefore, financial information related to these businesses has been excluded from the segment information below. IS&GS’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 9,381 $ 9,921 $ 9,599 Operating profit 874 814 874 Operating margin 9.3 % 8.2 % 9.1 % Backlog at year-end 9,300 9,700 10,700 35 Table of Contents Net sales for the IS&GS segment decreased $540 million, or 5%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of approximately $665 million due to the absence of the DRIS program that supported the 2010 U.S. census and a decline in activities on the JTRS program. This decrease partially was offset by increased net sales on numerous programs. Net sales for the IS&GS segment increased $322 million, or 3%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to higher volume of $620 million on the DRIS program and the Hanford Mission Support contract. These increases partially were offset by lower volume on numerous smaller programs. Operating profit for the IS&GS segment increased $60 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Operating profit increased approximately $180 million due to volume and the retirement of risks in 2011 and the absence of reserves recognized in 2010 on numerous programs (including among others, the NASA Outsourcing Desktop Initiative (ODIN) (about $60 million) and Transportation Worker Identification Credential and Automated Flight Service Station programs). The increases in operating profit partially were offset by the absence of the DRIS program and a decline in activities on the JTRS program of about $120 million. Operating profit for the IS&GS segment decreased $60 million, or 7%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease primarily was attributable to the recognition of reserves of about $55 million on several programs (including, among others, the ODIN program). Lower volume on numerous programs offset increased operating profit from the DRIS program. The decrease in backlog during 2011 compared to 2010 mainly was due to declining activities on the JTRS program and several other smaller programs. The decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume associated with the DRIS program, the Hanford Mission Support contract, and several other smaller programs. We expect IS&GS will experience a decrease in net sales in the mid to upper single digit percentage range for 2012 as compared to 2011. The decline is primarily due to the completion of various programs including ODIN, the U.K. Census, and JTRS, and we do not expect that this work will be replaced by other contracts due to the fiscal pressures constraining government purchases of IT and other products and services. Operating profit is expected to decline in 2012 in the upper single digit percentage range as a result of the lower sales volume, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems, including activities related to the planned replacement of the Space Shuttle. Space Systems is responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Orion, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) III system, and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Space Systems has an ownership interest in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services for the U.S. Government, and in United Space Alliance (USA), which provides processing activities for the Space Shuttle program, which is winding down following the completion of the last mission in 2011. Space Systems’ operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 8,134 $ 8,242 $ 8,650 Operating profit 989 968 967 Operating margin 12.2 % 11.7 % 11.2 % Backlog at year-end 16,000 17,800 16,800 Net sales for the Space Systems segment decreased $108 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of about $90 million related to the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the last Space Shuttle mission in July 2011, a decline in volume of about $90 million related to the Orion program, and lower volume of approximately $30 million related to government satellites. These decreases partially were offset by higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about $80 million and commercial satellites of approximately $45 million (one commercial satellite delivery in both 2011 and 2010). Net sales for the Space Systems segment decreased $408 million or 5% in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline principally was due to lower volume on defensive missile systems of approximately $150 million, the NASA External Tank 36 Table of Contents program of about $130 million due to the wind down of the Space Shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities of approximately $125 million. There was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and 2009 and no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases was a growth of about $35 million due to higher volume in government satellites activities. Operating profit for the Space Systems segment increased $21 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating profit principally was attributable to retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about $60 million and decreased equity earnings of about $30 million primarily due to the completion of the Space Shuttle program. Operating profit for the Space Systems segment was unchanged for 2010 compared to 2009. Operating profit increased on government satellites programs by approximately $15 million due to higher volume and risk retirements and higher equity earnings of approximately $40 million. These increases were offset by lower volume and reserve for performance of about $40 million on commercial satellite programs and lower volume on the NASA External Tank program of approximately $15 million. Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented approximately $230 million, or 23% of this segment’s operating profit during 2011. During 2010, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented approximately $260 million, or 27% of this segment’s operating profit. Backlog decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher sales volume associated with the Orion program and on government satellite activities. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on government satellite programs and strategic missile programs, which more than offset higher sales volume compared to new orders on the Orion program in 2010. We expect Space Systems’ net sales to decline in 2012 in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower activities on government satellite programs and the Orion program. Operating profit is expected to decline in the mid to upper single digit percentage range in 2012 due to the lower sales volume as well as lower equity earnings from ULA, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows Our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the changing economic and market conditions over the past few years. We continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments. We have generated strong operating cash flows which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and postretirement benefit plan funding. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. We expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, as discussed under Capital Structure, Resources, and Other. We have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately 55% of the sales we recorded in 2011, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast to cost-reimbursable contracts, for fixed-price contracts, which represented approximately 45% of the revenues we recorded in 2011, we generally do not bill until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The U.S. Government recently has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. The use of progress payment provisions on fixed-price contracts may delay our ability to recover costs incurred and affect the timing of our cash flows. 37 Table of Contents The majority of our capital expenditures for 2011 and those planned for 2012 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and IT. Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure as well as for the development or purchase of internal-use software. We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business, including capital expenditures and independent research and development, repurchased shares, increased our dividends, made selective acquisitions of businesses, and managed our debt levels. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information and the subsequent discussion provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 4,253 $ 3,801 $ 3,487 Net cash used for investing activities (a) (813 ) (573 ) (1,832 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,119 ) (3,358 ) (1,432 ) (a) In the fourth quarter of 2011, we revised the classification of cash payments associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software from operating cash flows to investing cash flows (Note 1). Cash flows for all years above have been adjusted for this change. Cash payments for internal-use software were $173 million in 2011, $254 million in 2010, and $314 million in 2009. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $452 million to $4.3 billion in 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven by a $536 million increase in cash provided by operating working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) as discussed below and $84 million related to lower net income tax payments due to the absence of a payment made in 2010 related to matters pending with IRS appeals. These improvements partially were offset by a $134 million net increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans, and lower operating results. The increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans was due to a $45 million increase in contributions paid to the pension trust and a decrease in the recovery of CAS costs on our contracts. The improvement in cash provided by operating working capital changes primarily was due to the timing of payment of accounts payable, which partially was offset by the timing of collections of accounts receivable and customer advance payments. The change in accounts receivable primarily reflects the timing of contract negotiations and related billing activities on the F-35 program at our Aeronautics segment. The decrease in cash flows from customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred was attributable to the C-130 programs at our Aeronautics segment, which was partially offset by various programs (largely PAC-3) at our Electronic Systems segment. Our operating working capital is subject to wide fluctuations based on the timing of cash transactions related to production schedules, timing of progress and advance payments, the acquisition of inventory, the collection of accounts receivable, and the payment of accounts payable. Cash provided by changes in operating working capital balances in 2012 may decrease over 2011 primarily due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable. Consequently, we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will be lower in 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $314 million to $3.8 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to changes in our operating working capital balances of $585 million and $187 million related to lower net income tax payments. Partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash of $350 million related to our defined benefit pension plans. The improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances. These improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems business segments. The increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at Space Systems and C-130 programs at Aeronautics, partially offset by a decrease on various programs at Electronic Systems. The decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments. The reduction in cash from defined benefit pension plans was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $758 million as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in the CAS costs recovered on our contracts. 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Capital expenditures – The majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment amounted to $814 million in 2011, $820 million in 2010, and $852 million in 2009. Costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software amounted to $173 million in 2011, $254 million in 2010, and $314 million in 2009, and have trended downward with the completion of certain infrastructure systems. We expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our planned annual capital expenditures over the next few years. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $649 million in 2011 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of QTC and Sim-Industries B.V. (Note 14), compared to amounts paid in 2010 of $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. In 2009, we paid $435 million for acquisition activities. In 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of EIG, net of $17 million in transaction costs (Note 14). There were no material divestiture activities in 2011 or 2009. During 2011, we decreased our short-term investments by $510 million compared to an increase of $171 million in 2010. Financing Activities Share activity and dividends – We paid cash totaling $2.5 billion for share repurchases during 2011, which included $63 million for shares we repurchased in December 2010 but that were not paid for until January 2011. In 2010 and 2009, we paid cash totaling $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion for share repurchases. Our share repurchase program provides for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time. Under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. In 2011, our Board authorized an additional $3.5 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total authorized amount under the program to $6.5 billion (Note 11). As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased a total of 43.0 million shares under the program for $3.2 billion, and there remained $3.3 billion available for additional share repurchases. We paid our stockholders cash dividends of $1.1 billion in 2011, $969 million in 2010, and $908 million in 2009. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. We declared quarterly dividends of: $.75 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2011 and $1.00 per share for the last quarter; $.63 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2010 and $.75 per share for the last quarter; and $.57 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2009 and $.63 per share for the last quarter. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $116 million, $59 million, and $40 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 2.3 million shares, 1.4 million shares, and 1.0 million shares during the respective periods. Issuance and repayment of long-term debt – In 2011, we issued a total of $2.0 billion of long-term notes. We used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term notes that were issued in 2011 to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases. We paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, and we paid $242 million in repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities. Capital Structure, Resources, and Other At December 31, 2011, we held cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $6.5 billion. As of the end of 2011, our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. In 2011, we issued $2.0 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering consisting of $500 million due in 2016 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 2.13%, $900 million due in 2021 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 3.35%, and $600 million due in 2041 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.85%. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases. We paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. 39 Table of Contents We issued $728 million of new 5.72% Notes due 2040 (the New Notes) in 2010 in exchange for $611 million of our then outstanding debt securities. We paid a premium of $158 million, of which $117 million was in the form of New Notes and $41 million was paid in cash, which was recorded as a discount and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the New Notes using the effective interest method. The New Notes are included on our Balance Sheet net of unamortized discounts. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering, $900 million of which are due in 2019 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.25%, and $600 million of which are due in 2039 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 5.50%. In August 2011, we entered into a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks and terminated our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which was to expire in June 2012. The new credit facility expires August 2016, and we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the new credit facility by an additional amount up to $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under either facility through December 31, 2011. Borrowings under the new credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the new credit facility. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the new credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the new credit facility. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2011. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the new credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission through August 2014 to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Our stockholders’ equity was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2010. The decrease primarily was due to the repurchase of 31.8 million common shares for $2.4 billion, dividends declared of $1.1 billion during the year, and net adjustments related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment of $2.9 billion, which on a net basis increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $2.2 billion. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $2.7 billion, and employee stock activity of $596 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $1.8 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 6,934 $ — $ 153 $ 954 $ 5,827 Interest payments 6,756 378 736 713 4,929 Other liabilities 2,379 278 451 282 1,368 Operating lease obligations 1,017 264 339 168 246 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 25,109 16,336 7,451 817 505 Capital expenditures 218 162 56 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 42,413 $ 17,418 $ 9,186 $ 2,934 $ 12,875 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2011. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and business acquisition agreements. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $23.2 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $7.6 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics and Electronic Systems segments, some of which extend through 2025. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2011 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We historically have not been required to pay material penalties. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of United Launch Alliance, L.L.C. (ULA), we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have each received distributions totaling $352 million (since ULA’s formation in December 2006) which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing, and ULA, whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to 41 Table of Contents ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity, including access to its $400 million revolving credit agreement from third-party financial institutions, to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for certain financial support arrangements (e.g., letters of credit or surety bonds provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2011, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on certain of our contracts. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) TotalCommitment Less Than 1 Year (a) Years 2 and 3 (a) Years 4 and 5 (a) After 5 Years (a) Standby letters of credit $ 2,675 $ 2,245 $ 300 $ 120 $ 10 Surety bonds 367 367 — — — Guarantees 907 1 25 323 558 Total commitments $ 3,949 $ 2,613 $ 325 $ 443 $ 568 (a) Approximately $2.1 billion, $53 million, and $3 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “Years 2 and 3,” and “Years 4 and 5,” periods, and approximately $32 million of surety bonds, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $309 million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $1.8 billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Approximately 85% of the $907 million in third-party guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2011 related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture partners. We evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities, and credit quality of potential joint venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. We believe our current and former joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2011, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Approximately 90% of our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development, and production activities (also referred to as DD&P contracts) and services provided to the U.S. Government, and FMS conducted through the U.S. Government. Approximately 95% of our net sales, including net sales related to DD&P contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, are accounted for using the POC method. The POC model requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers that are not associated with DD&P activities, which we continue to account for under the services accounting model. 42 Table of Contents Beginning January 1, 2011, we evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both DD&P activities and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the POC accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. This change in accounting has not had a material effect on our financial results, and is not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both DD&P activities and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 50% of our total net sales in 2011, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee (which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts) and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical, and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 45% of our total net sales in 2011, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales in 2011, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. POC Method of Accounting We record net sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for DD&P activities, and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The POC method for DD&P contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award fees and incentives, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the POC method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and 43 Table of Contents anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts under the POC method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance), and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. For many of our contracts, we are only able to estimate costs in ranges of amounts. Those ranges are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. At the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. The initial profit booking rate of each contract is based on the initial estimated costs at completion considering risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements. Business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic reviews. Management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract also perform recurring evaluations of technical matters, scheduling, and contract costs. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. Likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. For example, if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost-reimbursable contract, the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs, as well as previously incurred costs. As examples of how changes in profit booking rates can affect our financial statements, our net profit booking rate adjustments increased operating profit, net of state taxes, by approximately $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2011, 2010, and 2009, as we were able to successfully retire risks across a broad portfolio of contracts in those periods. Services Method of Accounting For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to 44 Table of Contents contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 10). The impact of these plans and benefits on our GAAP earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, and workforce demographics. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or liability on our Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined by the PPA. The U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Different actuarial valuations are used for GAAP, ERISA and CAS resulting in three different measurements of the funded status of our plans. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations. The primary year-end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans; the rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. When reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions, and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We selected 4.75% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 related to our defined benefit pension plans, compared to 5.5% at the end of 2010 and 5.875% at the end of 2009. We selected 4.50% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 related to our retiree medical plans, compared to 5.5% at the end of 2010 and 5.875% at the end of 2009. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. We concluded that 8.0% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2011, as compared to 8.5% used in prior years. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was adjusted downward due to the impact sovereign debt among developed countries may have on the rate of economic growth. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. 45 Table of Contents Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced by $11.2 billion from the annual year-end measurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of the December 31, 2011 adjustment of $2.9 billion. These noncash, after-tax amounts primarily represent net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates and differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions, which will be amortized to expense in future periods. During 2011, $666 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of our postretirement benefit plans expense and $812 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2012. We expect that our 2012 pension expense will increase to $1.9 billion as compared with 2011 pension expense of $1.8 billion, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above. The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.75% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2011, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2011 by approximately $1.3 billion, which would have resulted in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $850 million. If the 4.75% discount rate at December 31, 2011 that was used to compute the expected 2012 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2012 would be lower or higher by approximately $125 million. Funding Considerations The PPA became applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011 and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions. We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.3 billion in 2011, $2.2 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion in 2009. We recovered $899 million in 2011, $988 million in 2010 and $580 million in 2009 as CAS costs. Amounts funded under CAS are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS funding requirements, over $3.0 billion, are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. We expect to make contributions of $1.1 billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2012 and anticipate recovering $1.1 billion as CAS cost in 2012 which is consistent with our anticipated contributions. We may review options for further contributions in 2012. The CAS Board published its revised pension accounting rules (CAS Harmonization) with an effective date of February 27, 2012 to better align the recovery of pension contributions, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the PPA. The CAS Harmonization rules will increase our CAS cost beginning in 2013. There is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules will be phased in, with the full impact occurring in 2017. While we expect our 2013 CAS costs to be higher than our estimate for 2012 of $1.1 billion, the estimated incremental impact of CAS Harmonization in 2013 will be a very modest cost increase, with much larger increases occurring successively in years 2014 through 2017. Based upon current assumptions which may change, the increase in CAS costs caused by CAS Harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now, as our CAS costs should be in excess of the pension expense we record under GAAP. Accordingly, our non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, discussed further in the “Discussion of Business Segments” section above, should eventually increase earnings rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years. In addition, the increase in CAS costs should eventually cause our CAS costs to be greater than our pension contributions as we recover the prepayment credits, which should increase our cash flow from operations. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. At the end of 2011, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $932 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $808 million at December 31, 2011 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately twenty years. 46 Table of Contents We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). Both the EPA and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment announced plans in January 2011 to regulate two chemicals, perchlorate and hexavalent chromium, to levels in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goals or standards established in California. The rulemaking process is a lengthy one and may take one or more years to complete. If a substantially lower standard is adopted, we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to operations. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. 47 Table of Contents Goodwill Our goodwill at December 31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $10.1 billion and $9.6 billion. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. Our annual testing date is October 1. Performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value. We consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values, we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values, research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2011 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and, as such, no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term, as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying values. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued new accounting standards that are not effective until after December 31, 2011. For additional information, see the “Recent accounting pronouncements” section within Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. At December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments was approximately $7.8 billion, compared with a carrying value of $7.0 billion, excluding unamortized discounts of $506 million. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2011. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to manage the exchange rate risk of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash receipts and cash payments. The majority of our foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. We also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate, long-term debt. Our interest rate swap 48 Table of Contents contracts are designated as fair value hedges. Related gains and losses on foreign currency exchange and interest rate swap contracts, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. To the extent the hedges are ineffective, gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current period earnings. The aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2011 was $450 million. There were no interest rate swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (Note 15). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2011 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our cash flows. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a Rabbi Trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2011, investments in the Rabbi Trust totaled $781 million and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other assets. The Rabbi Trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. Changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in other non-operating income, net, and were not material during 2011. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the Rabbi Trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized on our Statement of Earnings in unallocated corporate costs and were not material during 2011. The current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our Balance Sheet in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes, and the non-current portion of the liability is on our Balance Sheet in other liabilities. The resulting change in the value of the liabilities has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the Rabbi Trust. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:44.715243
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2012, 82% of our $47.2 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 17% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government), and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology, including cyber security. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Effective December 31, 2012, we operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Mission Systems and Training (MST), and Space Systems. This structure reflects the reorganization of our former Electronic Systems business segment into the new MFC and MST business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment. In connection with this reorganization, management layers at our former Electronic Systems business segment and our former Global Training and Logistics (GTL) business were eliminated, and the former GTL business was split between the two new business segments. In addition, operating results for Sandia Corporation, which manages the Sandia National Laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy, and our equity interest in the U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) joint venture were transferred from our former Electronic Systems business segment to our Space Systems business segment. The amounts, discussion, and presentation of our business segments reflect this reorganization for all years presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in global security, as well as continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing more security capability quickly into the hands of both our domestic and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities. Despite the challenges we face, we expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to be successful in this environment, and return at least 50% of free cash flow1 to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our outlook for 2013 is premised on the assumption that sequestration does not occur, that the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our programs, which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through March 27, 2013, and that Congress approves defense budget legislation for government fiscal year (GFY) 2013 at a level consistent with the President’s proposed defense budget for the second half of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year 2013. With these assumptions, we expect 2013 net sales will decline at a mid single digit percentage rate from the record 2012 net sales amount, due to an anticipated reduction in net sales at four of five of our business segments as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. We expect our 2013 segment operating profit will also decrease from 2012 levels at a slightly higher percentage rate than the decline in net sales due to the factors mentioned in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below, and 2013 segment operating profit margin will accordingly be slightly lower than 2012 levels. If sequestration or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration occur, we expect these budget reductions would have a material effect on our corporation as discussed in the “Industry Considerations” section below and Item 1A- Risk Factors. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities The U.S. Government continues to focus on discretionary spending, entitlements, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. The Administration and Congress are attempting to balance decisions 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 23 Table of Contents regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Act), which reduced defense spending by a minimum of $487 billion over a ten-year period that began in GFY 2012. In light of the Budget Act and deficit reduction pressures generally, it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for a number of years. Notably, should Congress and the Administration fail to change or further delay the pending sequestration of appropriations in GFY 2013 imposed by the Budget Act, currently scheduled to take effect on March 1, 2013 as adjusted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Taxpayer Relief Act), both our DoD and non-DoD customers’ budgets would be reduced significantly and there would be a direct and significant reduction in our customers’ contract awards. Although the Taxpayer Relief Act delayed sequestration two months from January 2, 2013, to March 1, 2013, and reduced the amount of the GFY 2013 budget cuts, the impacts to our customers remain significant with limited time to implement spending reductions required under sequestration. In addition, Congress passed a continuing resolution funding measure for GFY 2013 to finance all U.S. Government activities through March 27, 2013. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for GFY 2012 are available, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key programs continue to be supported and funded under the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), and pending decisions related to sequestration we may experience delays in the receipt of orders for our products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays may affect our results of operations and cash flows. While the specific effects of sequestration still cannot be determined, automatic across-the-board cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten-year $487 billion reduction in defense spending that began in GFY 2012 already required by the Budget Act, including the budget for Overseas Contingencies Operations (OCO) and any unobligated balances from prior years, and would have significant consequences to our business and industry. Non-DoD agencies would also have significantly reduced budgets. There would be disruption of ongoing programs, impacts to our supply chain, contractual actions (including partial or complete terminations), potential facilities closures, and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge. Current estimates suggest that sequestration would reduce total GFY 2013 non-military personnel defense funding by 9% to approximately $500 billion. In addition, general estimates suggest that sequestration could result in an approximate 5% reduction to the total GFY 2013 non-defense budget. However, if sequestration goes into effect on March 1, 2013, government agencies will have already expended funds for several months of GFY 2013. Therefore, in order to achieve the across-the-board cuts imposed by sequestration over a shorter time period, the effective percentage reductions for the remaining months of GFY 2013 would be higher than the above percentages. While current DoD planning for the ongoing continuing resolution has focused on operating accounts in lieu of other accounts such as procurement and research, development, training, and evaluation due to the ability to quickly adjust activities and programs funded in these accounts, we understand that sequestration related cuts are likely to be applied across-the-board at the individual program, project, and activity level, thus impacting all defense programs and contractors regardless of how they align to our country’s most critical national priorities and mission areas. Consequently, we expect that sequestration, or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration, would have a material effect on our corporation. Our current sales outlook for 2013 is a mid single digit percentage rate decline from our record 2012 net sales amount, presuming sequestration does not occur, the continuing resolution ends on March 27, 2013, and other factors. Based on our preliminary understanding of sequestration and noting that it is difficult to estimate how sequestration would be implemented, we believe that, should Congress and the Administration fail to change or further delay sequestration, our 2013 net sales would be lower than 2012 net sales by more than the mid single digit outlook noted above. Future years could be materially impacted. However, subject to the uncertainty described above, we expect that the impact of sequestration on our operating results may lag in certain of our businesses with longer cycles such as our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and our products businesses within our MFC and MST business segments, due to our production contract backlog being funded with money from the U.S. Government’s GFY 2012 and prior budgets. We expect that earnings and cash flow reductions, prior to restructuring activities, would generally follow a pattern similar to the net sales reductions. We are unable to reasonably estimate the cost and cash flow impact of any restructuring initiatives (potentially including but not limited to severance payments made to employees, facility closure expenses, and impairments of assets, including goodwill) to align our cost structure to a lower sales base. 24 Table of Contents Sequestration likely would result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base. Such activity likely would result in claims from our suppliers, which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreements, the costs of evaluating the supplier settlement proposals, and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements. We expect that these costs would be recovered from our customers. Lockheed Martin is committed to the fair treatment of its employees and compliance with law. Accordingly, if sequestration or other budget cuts intended to avoid sequestration occur, we will provide affected employees the notice required by the federal and applicable state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Acts when we conclude, based on the circumstances and those laws, that notice is required or otherwise appropriate. The Office of Management and Budget and DoD have issued guidance intended to assure that the costs of complying with federal and state WARN Acts are recoverable, and we expect to recover these costs. Despite the continuing uncertainty on U.S. Government budgets, the investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. The possibility remains, however, that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, the implementation of sequestration, or other budget cuts intended to avoid sequestration. Department of Defense Business The passage of the Budget Act imposed specific limits on security and non-security spending beginning in GFY 2013. The GFY 2013 DoD base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending limits imposed by the Budget Act and is consistent with its limits on discretionary spending. The GFY 2014 request has been delayed as a result of the ongoing federal budgetary negotiations. The GFY 2014 request will likely reflect a continuation of the spending limits with some variation as a result of sequester negotiations. In prior years, the Administration has requested and Congress has provided funds for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations, through a separate OCO funding outside of the base DoD budget. The OCO funding for GFY 2012 totaled $115 billion, and the Administration requested $88 billion for GFY 2013. We expect that the fiscal 2014 request will continue these reductions, reflecting the completion of U.S. military operations in Iraq and reduced operations in Afghanistan. Our net sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests and, therefore, we continue to focus our attention on the DoD’s base budget for support and funding of our programs. The GFY 2013 budget proposal reflected the Administration’s new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending levels imposed by the Budget Act. We have no specific indications that the GFY 2014 budget will deviate significantly, other than the reduction due to the sequester delay as described above, from the estimated spending levels in the GFY 2013 request. Despite these reduced defense spending levels, we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD and our programs were well supported in the GFY 2013 budget request. For example, the budget supported continuation of all three variants of the F-35 and maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. Government. Additionally, the DoD has specifically cited continued support for a broad spectrum of our programs. Given the Administration’s emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiencies in the management and operations of DoD, the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cyber security, all remain national priorities. To address these priorities, we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these areas, diversifying our business, and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing aviation, and land vehicles. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Veterans Administration, National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 25 Table of Contents As with the DoD, all other departments and agencies were impacted by the Budget Act. The result would be that budgets for GFY 2013 and beyond will be reduced further below the GFY 2012 budget. Should sequester go into effect on March 1, 2013, our non-DoD customers will also be significantly affected as the across-the-board reductions will also be applied to their available GFY 2013 discretionary funds. Our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts that work with our non-DoD customers could be significantly impacted by the across-the-board reductions, such as our IS&GS business segment. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and Government information technology solutions for our customers, including the SSA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance, and enterprise solutions. We believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions in order to reduce costs of operations, but at a slower pace in the near term. In addition, we believe there are opportunities in the health care and energy space. Consistent with our DoD business, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cyber security all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. Other Business Considerations International Business We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. We conduct business with other governments primarily through our Aeronautics, MFC, and MST business segments. Our international sales are comprised of FMS transactions contracted through the U.S. Government and direct commercial sales transactions in which we sell directly to the international customer. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight other government development partners are working together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II, and Israel and Japan have selected the F-35 as their next generation combat aircraft. The first international deliveries of the F-35 were made in 2012, with two aircraft delivered to the United Kingdom. The number of aircraft for international customers in the more recent and future low-rate initial production (LRIP) contracts continues to increase. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 26 customers worldwide, including recent orders from Iraq and Oman, with 54 follow-on buys from 15 countries. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft’s international footprint with customers in 15 countries. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms, such as our agreement to upgrade 145 F-16 aircraft for Taiwan. We have also set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for the U.S., Norway, Canada, and Taiwan’s P-3 fleet. Our MFC business segment produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Additionally, the UAE entered into a FMS agreement with the U.S. Government for the first international sale of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system, with expectations for further production awards. Other countries in the Middle East as well as those in the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. In MST, with regard to the Aegis Combat System (Aegis), we perform activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea, and Australia. The system also has been selected to be used as a ground-based missile defense system in Europe, referred to as “Aegis Ashore.” This business segment has contracts with the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on Halifax class frigates. The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is another program generating interest from potential international customers. We are responsible for integrating mission systems and sensors, including the digital cockpit and weapons, for the MH-60 maritime helicopter produced for the Royal Australian Navy, and in 2012 the Danish government signed an official letter of offer and acceptance formalizing its intent to buy nine MH-60R helicopters. We continue to upgrade the United Kingdom’s Warrior fighting vehicles, an award received in 2011. 26 Table of Contents Status of F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of multiple contracts. The development contract is being performed concurrently with the LRIP contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test airplanes, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the development portion of the F-35 program will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts to continue into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine, and Navy variants of the aircraft, commitments from our eight international partners and two international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. On the development contract, our flight tests and test points were ahead of our goals for the year and the aircraft also surpassed 5,000 flight hours. The development contract currently has $530 million of incentive fees remaining; however, we expect to have the opportunity to earn approximately $350 million of this amount over the remainder of the contract. This amount includes about $100 million of fees that we expect will be allocated to specific milestones with the remainder allocated to a customer assessment of performance at the end of the development contract. After updating our estimates at completion on the contract in 2012, we reduced the profit booking rate to reflect lower expected estimated fees at completion. The inception to date impact of the revised booking rate reduced profit by approximately $85 million during 2012. We will continue to record profit at the revised booking rate for the duration of the contract unless further adjustments are necessary. We continue to make progress on our production tempo with the delivery of 30 aircraft to our domestic and international customers during the year, bringing the cumulative deliveries total to 58, which includes 20 development aircraft and 38 production aircraft. We also made significant contractual progress recently with the completion of negotiations on the LRIP 5 aircraft contract, award of an undefinitized contract for certain LRIP 6 aircraft, and received long lead funding for LRIP 7 aircraft. We have 88 production aircraft in backlog as of December 31, 2012. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, receiving funding for LRIP contracts on a timely basis, contractual withholds, executing future flight tests, and findings resulting from testing. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities, and through acquisition, divestiture, and internal realignment activities. Internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and equity investments. We used $304 million and $649 million for the acquisitions of businesses in 2012 and 2011. In 2012, we acquired Chandler/May, Inc. (Chandler/May) and CDL Systems Ltd. (CDL) in the fourth quarter and Procerus Technologies, L.C. (Procerus) in the first quarter. These companies specialize in the design, development, manufacturing, control, and support of advanced unmanned systems, which expand our offerings in support of our customers’ increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our strategy to maintain a portfolio of technology advanced options. These companies are part of our MST business segment where they have been integrated into our portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies to align their product and service offerings to the U.S. Army. In 2011, we acquired QTC Holdings Inc. (QTC) and Sim-Industries B.V. (Sim Industries) in the fourth quarter. QTC provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the U.S. Government and has been included in our IS&GS business segment. Sim Industries designs, develops, and manufactures full-motion and fixed-based civil aviation flight simulators for a wide range of airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide and has been included in our MST business segment. These companies complement our core capabilities and align with our strategy to expand into closely related markets and expand our customer base. 27 Table of Contents In pursuing our business strategies, we have also divested certain businesses over the past three years. Recent divestitures consisted of Savi Technology, Inc. (Savi) in 2012, Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE) in 2011, and Enterprise Integration Group (EIG) in 2010. For additional information, see “Note 14 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development, and manufacturing of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2012 2011 2010 Operating results Net sales $ 47,182 $ 46,499 $ 45,671 Cost of sales (a) (42,986 ) (42,755 ) (41,827 ) Other income, net 238 276 261 Operating profit (a) 4,434 4,020 4,105 Interest expense (383 ) (354 ) (345 ) Other non-operating income (expense), net (a) 21 (35 ) 18 Income tax expense (1,327 ) (964 ) (1,164 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 2,745 2,667 2,614 Net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations — (12 ) 264 Net earnings $ 2,745 $ 2,655 $ 2,878 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share Continuing operations $ 8.36 $ 7.85 $ 7.10 Discontinued operations — (.04 ) .71 Total $ 8.36 $ 7.81 $ 7.81 (a) In the fourth quarter of 2012, gains and losses on investments used to fund our deferred compensation plan liabilities were reclassified from other non-operating income (expense), net to other unallocated costs within cost of sales for all years presented on our Statements of Earnings in order to align the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities. The amounts in the above table and all prior year amounts included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect, as appropriate, this reclassification. Net gains on these investments in 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $67 million, $40 million, and $56 million. The following provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, MFC, MST, and Space Systems business segments, and most of our services sales are generated in our IS&GS and MFC business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): Net Sales 2012 2011 2010 Net sales Products $ 37,817 $ 36,925 $ 36,380 Services 9,365 9,574 9,291 Total $ 47,182 $ 46,499 $ 45,671 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting. Under the POC method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our “Business Segment Results of Operations” section because, due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales. 28 Table of Contents Product Sales Our product sales represent about 80% of our net sales for both 2012 and 2011. Product sales increased $892 million, or 2% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to production volume and deliveries, as well as higher risk retirements on certain programs. Product sales increased about $555 million at Aeronautics (e.g., F-35 LRIP contracts, F-16 deliveries); about $510 million at MST (e.g., ship and aviation system programs); about $225 million at Space Systems (e.g., commercial satellites, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) program); and about $100 million at MFC (e.g., tactical missile programs and air and missile defense programs). These increases partially were offset by lower product sales of about $495 million at IS&GS (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), U.K. Census). Our product sales represent about 80% of our net sales for both 2011 and 2010. Product sales increased $545 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared to 2010 due to production volume and deliveries, as well as higher risk retirements on certain programs. Product sales increased about $1.2 billion at Aeronautics (e.g., F-35 LRIP contracts, C-130 programs) and about $320 million at MFC (e.g., air and missile defense programs). These increases partially were offset by lower product sales of about $700 million at IS&GS (e.g., Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program that supported the 2010 U.S. census, JTRS); about $260 million at MST (e.g., ship and aviation system programs); and about $60 million at Space Systems (e.g., Orion program and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) External Tank program). Services Sales Our services sales represent about 20% of our net sales for 2012 and 2011. Our services sales decreased $209 million, or 2%, during 2012 compared to 2011. Services sales at MFC decreased about $105 million primarily due to lower volume and risk retirements on various services programs. Services sales at MST decreased about $60 million primarily due to lower volume on various training services programs. Services sales at IS&GS decreased about $40 million primarily due to the substantial completion of the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA (ODIN) during 2011 and lower volume on the Hanford Mission Support (Hanford) contract, partially offset by higher net sales from QTC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our services sales represent about 20% of our net sales for 2011 and 2010. Our services sales increased $283 million, or 3%, during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in services sales was attributable to higher services sales at both our MFC and IS&GS business segments. Services sales at MFC increased about $215 million primarily due to growth on the Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS) program, partially offset by decreased volume on various services programs. Services sales at IS&GS increased about $155 million due to activities on a number of smaller contracts. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative). For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Cost of sales Cost of product sales $ 33,495 $ 32,968 $ 32,539 % of product sales 88.6 % 89.3 % 89.4 % Cost of services sales 8,383 8,514 8,382 % of services sales 89.5 % 88.9 % 90.2 % Severance and other charges 48 136 220 Other unallocated costs 1,060 1,137 686 Total $ 42,986 $ 42,755 $ 41,827 Due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our cost of product and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our “Business Segment Results of Operations” section. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales that would have a material impact on our future operations. 29 Table of Contents Cost of Product Sales The increase of $527 million, or 2%, in cost of product sales during 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher cost of product sales at our Aeronautics, MST, and Space Systems business segments, partially offset by lower cost of product sales at our IS&GS and MFC business segments. Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $520 million primarily due to increased production volume on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales at MST increased by about $485 million primarily due to increased volume on ship and aviation system programs partially offset by reserves of about $55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). Cost of product sales at Space Systems increased by about $180 million primarily due to increased volume on commercial satellites programs, Orion, and various strategic and defensive missile programs. Cost of product sales at IS&GS decreased by about $530 million primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 as well as lower volume on numerous other programs. Cost of product sales at MFC decreased by about $70 million primarily due to higher risk retirements from tactical missile programs and fire control systems programs as well as the favorable resolution of contractual matters, partially offset by volume on air and missile defense programs. The 0.7% decrease in the percentage of cost of product sales relative to product sales in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily was due to higher risk retirements (primarily tactical missile programs) as well as the favorable resolution of contractual matters at MFC and higher risk retirements and lower reserves on ship and aviation system programs at MST. The increase of $429 million, or 1%, in cost of product sales during 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher cost of product sales at our Aeronautics and MFC business segments, partially offset by lower cost of product sales at our IS&GS, MST, and Space Systems business segments. Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $1.1 billion primarily due to higher production volume on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales at MFC increased about $260 million primarily due to production on air and missile defense programs. Cost of product sales at IS&GS decreased about $560 million primarily due to the absence of the DRIS program and lower volume on the JTRS program. Cost of product sales at MST decreased about $230 million primarily due to decreased volume on certain ship and aviation system programs and recording of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010. Cost of product sales decreased at Space Systems by about $120 million primarily due to lower volume on the NASA External Tank and Orion programs. Cost of Services Sales Our cost of services sales decreased $131 million, or 2%, during 2012 compared to 2011. Most of our cost of services sales are in the IS&GS and MFC business segments. The decrease in cost of services sales primarily was attributable to lower cost of services sales at our MFC and MST business segments, partially offset by higher cost of services sales at our IS&GS business segment. Cost of services sales at MFC decreased approximately $105 million primarily due to lower volume on various services programs. Cost of services sales at MST decreased approximately $90 million primarily due to lower volume on various training services programs. Cost of services sales at IS&GS increased approximately $80 million primarily due to higher net sales from QTC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011, and various other services programs partially offset by lower costs from the substantial completion of ODIN in 2011 and lower volume on the Hanford contract. The 0.6% increase in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily was due to risk retirements on the ODIN and Hanford contracts in 2011. Our cost of services sales increased $132 million, or 2%, during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in cost of services sales primarily was attributable to higher cost of services sales at our MFC business segment, partially offset by lower cost of services sales at our IS&GS business segment. Cost of services sales at MFC increased approximately $190 million primarily due to growth on the SOF CLSS program. Cost of services sales at IS&GS decreased by about $55 million primarily due to higher margins as the result of risk retirements on various programs (including ODIN) during 2011 and the recording of reserves on various programs in 2010. The 1.3% decrease in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily was due to the retirement of risks and other factors on numerous programs at IS&GS, partially offset by volume on SOF CLSS, which provides a lower margin relative to other MFC programs. Severance and Other Charges During 2012, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $48 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $25 million related to our Aeronautics business segment and $23 million related to the reorganization of our former Electronic Systems business segment (Note 3). These charges reduced our net earnings by $31 million ($.09 per share) and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. The severance actions at our Aeronautics business segment resulted from cost reduction initiatives, including the consolidation of selected program support activities among certain Aeronautics locations. 30 Table of Contents During 2011, we recorded severance charges related to various severance actions totaling $136 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $49 million, $48 million, and $39 million related to our Aeronautics business segment, Space Systems business segment, and our IS&GS business segment and Corporate Headquarters. These charges reduced our net earnings by $88 million ($.26 per share) and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. These severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our Corporate Headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. The workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles, where several of our major programs are either transitioning out of development and into production or are ending. During 2010, we recorded a charge of $178 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP). The charge, which included lump-sum special payments for qualifying executives, reduced our net earnings by $116 million ($.31 per share). The amounts of the VESP attributable to our business segments were $25 million at Aeronautics, $42 million at IS&GS, $17 million at MFC, $21 million at MST, and $41 million at Space Systems. The remaining $32 million was attributable to our Corporate Headquarters. Also, in 2010, our MST business segment decided to consolidate certain of its operations, including the closure of a facility in Eagan, Minnesota. Accordingly, we recorded a charge to cost of sales of $42 million, net of state tax benefits, which reduced our net earnings by $27 million ($.07 per share). The majority of the charge was associated with the accrual of severance payments to employees, with the remainder associated with impairment of assets. We expect to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges, including the charge related to the VESP, in future periods through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers. While the VESP is expected to be recovered over several years, the other severance charges are typically expected to be recovered within a one-year period after the charge has been incurred, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. Other Unallocated Costs Other unallocated costs principally include the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, stock-based compensation, and other corporate costs. These costs are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the costs of product and services sales (see “Note 3 – Information on Business Segments” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of these items). The $77 million decrease in other unallocated costs between 2012 and 2011 primarily was due to a decrease in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $92 million, partially offset by fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. Other unallocated costs increased $451 million between 2011 and 2010, primarily attributable to an increase in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $468 million, which included increased FAS pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate in 2011. For more information, see the related discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans.” Other Income, Net Other income, net for 2012 was $238 million, compared to $276 million in 2011 and $261 million in 2010. The changes between years primarily were due to fluctuations in equity earnings in investees in our Space Systems business segment. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2012 was $383 million, compared to $354 million in 2011 and $345 million in 2010. The increase between the years primarily was due to increased interest expense from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt on September 9, 2011, partially offset by the redemption of $500 million in certain long-term notes in the fourth quarter of 2011. Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net Other non-operating income (expense), net was $21 million in 2012, compared to $(35) million in 2011 and $18 million in 2010. The change between years primarily was due to premiums of $48 million on early extinguishments of debt that occurred in 2011 (Note 8). Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 32.6% for 2012, 26.5% for 2011, and 30.8% for 2010. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities. 31 Table of Contents The effective income tax rate for 2012 included a reduction in the income tax benefit of the U.S. manufacturing deduction primarily caused by the $2.5 billion discretionary pension contributions in the fourth quarter of 2012, which increased income tax expense by $59 million ($.18 per share). As a result of the accelerated pension contributions in 2012, we expect to capture most of the reduced manufacturing deduction over the next two years through higher taxable income. The effective income tax rate for 2011 included a reduction to income tax expense of $89 million, or $.26 per diluted share, through the elimination of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completing its review of the Internal Revenue Service Appeals Division’s resolution of adjustments related to tax years 2003 through 2008. The effective income tax rates for 2011 and 2010 also included the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit that expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which retroactively reinstates the R&D credit for two years, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. Since tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the Corporation did not recognize the tax benefit of the R&D tax credit in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2010 was affected by the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the tax deduction for company-paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. As a result, we recorded additional income tax expense of $96 million in 2010. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.75 billion ($8.36 per share) in 2012, $2.67 billion ($7.85 per share) in 2011, and $2.61 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2010. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share in 2011 and 2010 benefited from a net decrease of common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased, which were partially offset by share issuances under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net decreases of 25.1 million and 27.0 million in 2011 and 2010 represented 7% and 7% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of each year. Net (Loss) Earnings from Discontinued Operations Amounts related to discontinued operations in 2012 were not significant and, accordingly, were included in operating profit. Discontinued operations for 2011 include the operating results and other adjustments of Savi, a logistics business that was in our former Electronic Systems business segment sold in the third quarter of 2012 , and PAE, a business formerly within our IS&GS business segment sold in the second quarter of 2011. Discontinued operations for 2010 include the operating results of Savi, PAE, and EIG through the date of its sale in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net loss from discontinued operations were $12 million ($.04 per share) in 2011, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $264 million ($.71 per share) in 2010. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2011 included a deferred tax asset of $66 million that we expected to realize on the sale of Savi because our tax basis was higher than our book basis. This tax benefit was largely offset by operating losses and other adjustments. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2010 included a gain, net of income taxes, of $184 million ($.50 per share) from the sale of EIG. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell PAE in 2010, we recorded net adjustments that increased 2010 earnings from discontinued operations by $73 million ($.20 per share). For more information, see “Note 14 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Results of Operations We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, IS&GS, MFC, MST, and Space Systems. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions similar to our third-party contracts. Operating profit of our business segments includes equity earnings or losses from investees because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those business segments. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation programs; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to significant severance actions in 2012 and 2011 and the charges in 2010 related to the VESP and the facilities consolidation within MST (Note 13); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 14); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated expenses, net” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. 32 Table of Contents The results of operations of our business segments include pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. CAS governs the extent to which pension costs can be allocated to and recovered on U.S. Government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (Note 14) for all years presented. Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales Aeronautics $ 14,953 $ 14,362 $ 13,109 Information Systems & Global Solutions 8,846 9,381 9,921 Missiles and Fire Control 7,457 7,463 6,930 Mission Systems and Training 7,579 7,132 7,443 Space Systems 8,347 8,161 8,268 Total net sales $ 47,182 $ 46,499 $ 45,671 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,699 $ 1,630 $ 1,498 Information Systems & Global Solutions 808 874 814 Missiles and Fire Control 1,256 1,069 973 Mission Systems and Training 737 645 713 Space Systems 1,083 1,063 1,030 Total business segment operating profit 5,583 5,281 5,028 Unallocated expenses, net: Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment: FAS pension expense (1,941 ) (1,821 ) (1,442 ) Less: CAS expense 1,111 899 988 Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment (a) (830 ) (922 ) (454 ) Severance and other charges (b) (48 ) (136 ) (220 ) Stock-based compensation (167 ) (157 ) (168 ) Other, net (c) (104 ) (46 ) (81 ) Total unallocated expenses, net (1,149 ) (1,261 ) (923 ) Total consolidated operating profit $ 4,434 $ 4,020 $ 4,105 (a) FAS pension expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011, and in 2011 to 2010, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate in 2012 and 2011. The segment operating profit includes pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with CAS. The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be about $(485) million in 2013. For more information, see the related discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans”). (b) Severance and other charges include the severance charges recorded in 2012 associated with our Aeronautics business segment and the reorganization of our former Electronic Systems business segment; for 2011, include the severance charges associated with our Aeronautics, IS&GS, and Space Systems business segments, and Corporate Headquarters; and for 2010, include the charges related to the VESP and the facilities consolidation within our MST business segment (Note 13). Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (c) The change between years primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $82.3 billion, $80.7 billion, and $78.4 billion at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $54.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. 33 Table of Contents We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) or for services, the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components, to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs (for example, material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and costs aspects of the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the POC method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the POC method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. In the discussion of comparative segment results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by changes in estimated profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the POC method of accounting. Increases in the estimated profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the estimated profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit may also be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters, reserves for disputes, asset impairments and insurance recoveries, among others. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates, or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments and other matters, increased segment operating profit, net of state income taxes, by approximately $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion for 2012, 2011, and 2010. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments and resolution of contractual matters at our MST and MFC business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2012 are inclusive of approximately $500 million in unfavorable items, about $100 million higher than 2011. The variance is primarily due to an adjustment on our F-35 program as described in our 34 Table of Contents Aeronautics business segment’s results of operations discussion. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our IS&GS and Aeronautics business segments. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-130 Hercules, and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 14,953 $ 14,362 $ 13,109 Operating profit 1,699 1,630 1,498 Operating margins 11.4 % 11.3 % 11.4 % Backlog at year-end 30,100 30,500 27,500 2012 compared to 2011 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2012 increased $591 million, or 4%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $745 million from F-35 LRIP contracts principally due to increased production volume; about $285 million from F-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries (37 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers; and approximately $140 million from C-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries (four C-5M aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the F-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012; approximately $110 million from the F-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume; and about $95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other Aeronautics programs due to higher volume. Net sales for C-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries. Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2012 increased $69 million, or 4%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $105 million from C-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements; about $50 million from F-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements; approximately $50 million from F-35 LRIP contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements; and about $50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain F-16 contracts. Partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $90 million from the F-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012; approximately $50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the F-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012; and approximately $45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other Aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit for C-5 programs was comparable to 2011. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011. 2011 compared to 2010 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2011 increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, compared to 2010. The growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $850 million for work performed on the F-35 LRIP contracts as production increased; higher volume of about $745 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (33 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010) and support activities; about $425 million for F-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries (22 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010); and approximately $90 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (two C-5M aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010). These increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $675 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program and lower net sales of about $155 million for the F-35 development contract as development work decreased. 35 Table of Contents Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2011 increased $132 million, or 9%, compared to 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to approximately $115 million of higher operating profit on C-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks; increased volume and risk retirements on F-16 programs of about $50 million and C-5 programs of approximately $20 million; and about $70 million due to risk retirements on other Aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011. These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on the F-22 program and F-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about $55 million on other programs, including F-35 LRIP, primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011 compared to 2010. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $90 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on F-35 contracts and C-130 programs, partially offset by higher orders on F-16 programs. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher orders on F-35 contracts, which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the C-130 programs. Trends We expect Aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2013 as compared to 2012. A decrease in net sales from a decline in F-16 and C-130J aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on F-35 LRIP contracts. Operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2012 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides management services, integrated information technology solutions, and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on October 1, 2012, the start of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year. IS&GS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 8,846 $ 9,381 $ 9,921 Operating profit 808 874 814 Operating margins 9.1 % 9.3 % 8.2 % Backlog at year-end 8,700 9,300 9,700 2012 compared to 2011 IS&GS’ net sales for 2012 decreased $535 million, or 6%, compared to 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 (primarily JTRS; ODIN; and U.K. Census); and about $255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs (primarily Hanford; Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T); Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC); and Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)). Partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately $140 million from QTC, which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011; and about $65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs, primarily federal cyber security programs and Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) operational support. IS&GS’ operating profit for 2012 decreased $66 million, or 8%, compared to 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $50 million due to the favorable impact of the ODIN contract completion in 2011; about $25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012; and approximately $20 million due to lower volume on certain programs (primarily C2BMC and WIN-T). Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $15 million from the TWIC program; and about $10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs, primarily federal cyber security programs and PTDS operational support. Operating profit for the JTRS program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. 36 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 IS&GS’ net sales for 2011 decreased $540 million, or 5%, compared to 2010. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of approximately $665 million due to the absence of the DRIS program that supported the 2010 U.S. census and a decline in activities on the JTRS program. This decrease partially was offset by increased net sales on numerous programs. IS&GS’ operating profit for 2011 increased $60 million, or 7%, compared to 2010. Operating profit increased approximately $180 million due to volume and the retirement of risks in 2011 and the absence of reserves recognized in 2010 on numerous programs (including among others, ODIN (about $60 million) and TWIC and Automated Flight Service Station programs). The increases in operating profit partially were offset by the absence of the DRIS program and a decline in activities on the JTRS program of about $120 million. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $130 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs in 2011 (primarily ODIN, U.K. Census, and JTRS). The decrease in backlog during 2011 compared to 2010 mainly was due to declining activities on the JTRS program and several other smaller programs. Trends We expect IS&GS’ net sales to decline in 2013 in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets. Operating profit is expected to decline in 2013 in the mid single digit percentage range consistent with the expected decline in net sales, resulting in margins that are comparable with 2012 results. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; logistics and other technical services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Javelin, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache Fire Control System (Apache), Sniper®, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®), and SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 7,457 $ 7,463 $ 6,930 Operating profit 1,256 1,069 973 Operating margins 16.8 % 14.3 % 14.0 % Backlog at year-end 14,700 14,400 12,800 2012 compared to 2011 MFC’s net sales for 2012 were comparable to 2011. Net sales decreased approximately $130 million due to lower volume and risk retirements on various services programs, and about $60 million due to lower volume from fire control systems programs (primarily Sniper®; LANTIRN®; and Apache). The decreases largely were offset by higher net sales of approximately $95 million due to higher volume from tactical missile programs (primarily Javelin and Hellfire) and approximately $80 million for air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD). MFC’s operating profit for 2012 increased $187 million, or 17%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher risk retirements and volume of about $95 million from tactical missile programs (primarily Javelin and Hellfire); increased risk retirements and volume of approximately $60 million for air and missile defense programs (primarily THAAD and PAC-3); and about $45 million from a resolution of contractual matters. Partially offsetting these increases was lower risk retirements and volume on various programs, including $25 million for services programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $145 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. 37 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 MFC’s net sales for 2011 increased $533 million, or 8%, compared to 2010. The increase was attributable to higher volume of about $420 million on air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD); and about $245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the SOF CLSS program, which began late in the third quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $20 million from tactical missile programs (primarily MLRS and JASSM). MFC’s operating profit for 2011 increased $96 million, or 10%, compared to 2010. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $60 million for air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks; and approximately $25 million for various services programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $35 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010. Backlog Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs (primarily LANTIRN® and Sniper®) and on various services programs, partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased orders on air and missile defense programs (primarily THAAD). Trends We expect MFC’s net sales for 2013 will be comparable with 2012. We expect low double digit percentage growth in air and missile defense programs, offset by an expected decline in volume on logistics services programs. Operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2012 results. Mission Systems and Training Our MST business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; unmanned technologies and platforms; ship systems integration; and military and commercial training systems. MST’s major programs include Aegis, MK-41 Vertical Launching System (VLS), TPQ-53 Radar System, MH-60, LCS, and PTDS. MST’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 7,579 $ 7,132 $ 7,443 Operating profit 737 645 713 Operating margins 9.7 % 9.0 % 9.6 % Backlog at year-end 10,700 10,500 10,600 2012 compared to 2011 MST’s net sales for 2012 increased $447 million, or 6%, compared to 2011. The increase in net sales for 2012 was attributable to higher volume and risk retirements of approximately $395 million from ship and aviation system programs (primarily PTDS; LCS; VLS; and MH-60); about $115 million for training and logistics solutions programs primarily due to net sales from Sim Industries, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011; and approximately $30 million as a result of increased volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Aegis). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $70 million from undersea systems programs due to lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems; and about $25 million due to lower volume on various other programs. MST’s operating profit for 2012 increased $92 million, or 14%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $175 million from ship and aviation system programs, which reflects higher volume and risk retirements on certain programs (primarily VLS; PTDS; MH-60; and LCS) and reserves of about $55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). Partially offsetting the increase was lower operating profit of approximately $40 million from undersea systems programs due to reduced profit booking rates on certain programs and lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems; and about $40 million due to lower volume on various other programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $150 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. 38 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 MST’s net sales for 2011 decreased $311 million, or 4%, compared to 2010. The decrease was attributable to decreased volume of approximately $390 million for certain ship and aviation system programs (primarily Maritime Patrol Aircraft and PTDS) and approximately $75 million for training and logistics solutions programs. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher sales of about $165 million from production on the LCS program. MST’s operating profit for 2011 decreased $68 million, or 10%, compared to 2010. The decrease was attributable to decreased operating profit of approximately $55 million as a result of increased reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation system programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program) and approximately $40 million due to lower volume and increased reserves on training and logistics solutions. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher operating profit of approximately $30 million in 2011 primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $55 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010. Backlog Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily MH-60 and LCS), partially offset decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Aegis). Backlog decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. Trends We expect MST’s net sales to decline in 2013 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due to the completion of PTDS deliveries in 2012 and expected lower volume on training services programs. Operating profit and margin are expected to increase slightly from 2012 levels primarily due to anticipated improved contract performance. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) III system, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, and Orion. Operating results for our Space Systems business segment include our equity interests in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services for the U.S. Government, United Space Alliance (USA), which provided processing activities for the Space Shuttle program and is winding down following the completion of the last Space Shuttle mission in 2011, and a joint venture that manages the U.K.’s Atomic Weapons Establishment program. Space Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 8,347 $ 8,161 $ 8,268 Operating profit 1,083 1,063 1,030 Operating margins 13.0 % 13.0 % 12.5 % Backlog at year-end 18,100 16,000 17,800 2012 compared to 2011 Space Systems’ net sales for 2012 increased $186 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $150 million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries (two commercial satellites delivered in 2012 compared to one during 2011); about $125 million from the Orion program due to higher volume and an increase in risk retirements; and approximately $70 million from increased volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs. Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $105 million from certain government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) as a result of decreased volume and a decline in risk retirements; and about $55 million from the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. 39 Table of Contents Space Systems’ operating profit for 2012 increased $20 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $60 million from commercial satellite programs due to increased deliveries and reserves recorded in 2011; and about $40 million from the Orion program due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. Partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of approximately $45 million from lower volume and risk retirements on certain government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS); about $20 million from lower risk retirements and lower volume on the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011; and approximately $20 million from lower equity earnings as a decline in launch related activities at ULA partially was offset by the resolution of contract cost matters associated with the wind-down of USA. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments described above, were approximately $15 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. 2011 compared to 2010 Space Systems’ net sales for 2011 decreased $107 million, or 1%, compared to 2010. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of about $90 million related to the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the last Space Shuttle mission in July 2011; a decline in volume of about $90 million related to the Orion program; and lower volume of approximately $30 million related to government satellites. These decreases partially were offset by higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about $80 million and commercial satellites of approximately $45 million (one commercial satellite delivery in both 2011 and 2010). Space Systems’ operating profit for 2011 increased $33 million, or 3%, compared to 2010. The increase in operating profit principally was attributable to retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about $60 million, partially offset by decreased equity earnings of about $15 million primarily due to the wind-down of USA. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $15 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010. Equity earnings Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA, USA, and AWE represented approximately $265 million, or 24% of this segment’s operating profit during 2012. During 2011 and 2010, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA, USA, and AWE represented approximately $285 million and $300 million, or 27% and 29% of this segment’s operating profit. Backlog Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to higher orders on government satellites activities, partially offset by lower orders on the Orion program. Backlog decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher sales volume associated with the Orion program and on government satellite activities. Trends We expect Space Systems’ net sales to decline in 2013 in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due primarily to the absence of any commercial satellite deliveries in 2013. Operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in 2013 primarily due to lower equity earnings from USA, as no further significant activity is expected due to its wind-down in 2012, and lower sales volume, resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business, including capital expenditures and independent research and development, returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, made selective acquisitions of businesses, and managed our debt levels. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and postretirement benefit plan funding. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the 40 Table of Contents foreseeable future. We have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, as discussed in the “Capital Structure, Resources, and Other” section. We have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2012, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. By way of contrast, we generally do not bill our fixed-price contracts until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. Such payments may precede our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby increasing our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on receivables. The amount of withholds increased to approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2012, primarily at our Aeronautics business segment related to U.S. Government audits of our business systems and certain delivered F-35 aircraft. While the impact of withholding delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2012 and those planned for 2013 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and information technology. Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities, inclusive of our efforts to consolidate and reduce leased facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure as well as for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information (in millions) followed by a discussion of the key elements: 2012 2011 2010 Operating activities Net earnings $ 2,745 $ 2,655 $ 2,878 Non-cash adjustments 2,133 1,194 1,721 Changes in working capital (1,061 ) 674 138 Other, net (2,256 ) (270 ) (936 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,561 $ 4,253 $ 3,801 Net cash used for investing activities $ (1,222 ) $ (813 ) $ (573 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (2,023 ) $ (2,119 ) $ (3,358 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,898 $ 3,582 $ 2,261 Operating Activities 2012 compared to 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $2.7 billion in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to changes in working capital of $1.7 billion and increased pension contributions of $1.1 billion, net of CAS recoveries. The decrease of $1.7 billion in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was driven by higher payments of accounts payable due to timing as well as the timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to 41 Table of Contents inventories. Additionally, growth in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of finalizing contract negotiations on the F-35 LRIP contracts in the fourth quarter of 2012, which delayed our billings, as well as the impact of U.S. Government withholdings on the F-35 program reduced the cash provided by operating activities. 2011 compared to 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $452 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to changes in working capital. Cash provided by working capital increased by $536 million due to increases in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments and an increase in customer advances due to the timing of production and billing schedules. This improvement in cash from working capital partially was offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of contract negotiations and billing activities on the F-35 program. Partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by working capital was higher pension contributions, net of CAS recoveries of $134 million. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures amounted to $942 million in 2012, $987 million in 2011, and $1.1 billion in 2010. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities – Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $304 million in 2012 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Chandler/May, CDL, and Procerus (Note 14). In 2011, we paid $649 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of QTC and Sim-Industries (Note 14). In 2010, we paid $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. In 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of EIG (Note 14). During 2011, we decreased our short-term investments by $510 million compared to an increase of $171 million in 2010. Financing Activities Dividends and share activity – We paid dividends totaling $1.4 billion ($4.15 per share) in 2012, $1.1 billion ($3.25 per share) in 2011, and $969 million ($2.64 per share) in 2010. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2012. We declared quarterly dividends of $1.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2012 and $1.15 per share for the last quarter; $.75 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2011 and $1.00 per share for the last quarter; and $.63 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2010 and $.75 per share for the last quarter. We paid cash totaling $1.0 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.4 billion for share repurchases during 2012, 2011, and 2010. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $6.5 billion of our common stock. Under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. As of December 31, 2012, we had repurchased a total of 54.3 million shares of our common stock under the program for $4.2 billion, and there remained $2.3 billion authorized for additional share repurchases. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2012, 2011, and 2010 totaled $440 million, $116 million, and $59 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 6.7 million shares, 2.3 million shares, and 1.4 million shares during the respective periods. Long-term debt – In 2012, we paid $225 million to complete an exchange of debt (Note 8) to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In 2011, we issued a total of $2.0 billion of long-term notes with fixed coupon rates ranging from 2.13% to 4.85%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term notes that were issued in 2011 to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we also repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases and paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. Capital Structure, Resources, and Other At December 31, 2012, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $500 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash was repatriated at the end of 2012, we estimate that about $45 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits. 42 Table of Contents Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $6.2 billion, and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. In August 2011, we entered into a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks and terminated our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that was to expire in June 2012. The credit facility expires August 2016, and we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the credit facility by an additional amount up to $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under either facility through December 31, 2012. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the credit facility. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the credit facility. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility, as well as in our debt agreements. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2012. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through August 2014 to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Our stockholders’ equity was $39 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $962 million from December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $3.2 billion, which was partially offset by the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses of $858 million in 2012; dividends declared of $1.4 billion during the year; and the repurchase of 11.3 million common shares for $1.0 billion. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $2.7 billion and employee stock activity of $900 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $108 million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. If in the future we were to have a deficit in stockholders’ equity as a result of further adjustments associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plans, the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenants. The debt-related financial covenants in our revolving credit facility exclude the effect of adjustments to stockholders’ equity resulting from re-measuring the funded status of postretirement plans. In addition, as a Maryland corporation, so long as we are able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business, we anticipate that we would be able to pay dividends and make stock repurchases in an amount limited to our net earnings in either the current or the preceding fiscal year or from the net earnings for the preceding eight quarters. 43 Table of Contents Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2012, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 7,165 $ 150 $ — $ 952 $ 6,063 Interest payments 6,243 355 698 633 4,557 Other liabilities 2,628 271 430 365 1,562 Operating lease obligations 859 229 279 151 200 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 24,837 14,859 8,127 1,697 154 Capital expenditures 216 102 78 36 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 41,948 $ 15,966 $ 9,612 $ 3,834 $ 12,536 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2012. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $22.8 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2012, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $9.3 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC, and MST business segments, some of which extend through 2026. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2012 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have each received distributions totaling $494 million (since ULA’s formation in December 2006) which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing, and ULA, whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the 44 Table of Contents inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity, including access to its $560 million revolving credit agreement from third-party financial institutions, to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2012, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2012, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period TotalCommitment Less Than 1 Year (a) Years 2 and 3 (a) Years 4 and 5 (a) After 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 1,074 $ 759 $ 236 $ 79 $ — Surety bonds 357 357 — — — Guarantees 816 2 98 170 546 Total commitments $ 2,247 $ 1,118 $ 334 $ 249 $ 546 (a) Approximately $609 million, $23 million, and $3 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year,” “Years 2 and 3,” and “Years 4 and 5,” periods, and approximately $34 million of surety bonds, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. At December 31, 2012, third-party guarantees totaled $816 million, of which approximately 85% related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. We believe our current and former joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2012, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities, and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the POC method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services accounting model. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the POC accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to other governments conducted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts. 45 Table of Contents Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 45%, 50%, and 60% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical, and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 50%, 45%, and 35% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales in each of 2012, 2011, and 2010, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. POC Method of Accounting We record net sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The POC method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the POC method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts under the POC method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance), and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and 46 Table of Contents availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs (for example, material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and costs aspects of the contract. Alternatively, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by changes in estimated profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the POC method of accounting. Increases in the estimated profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the total estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the estimated profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit may also be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters, reserves for disputes, asset impairments and insurance recoveries, among others. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates, or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Services Method of Accounting Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. 47 Table of Contents Postretirement Benefit Plans Overview Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 9). In recent years, we have taken certain actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results, including no longer offering a defined benefit pension plan to new, non-represented employees starting in January 2006. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with our union represented population and as a result substantially all represented employees hired after June 2012 do not participate in a defined benefit pension plan. We have also made substantial cash contributions over the years to our defined benefit pension plans including $3.6 billion in 2012. Additionally, during 2012 lump settlement payments of $310 million were made from the defined benefit pension trust to certain former employees who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payments, and the corresponding benefit obligation that was released was $375 million. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our GAAP earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, rates of return on plan assets, and other actuarial assumptions including expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover and mortality, as well as the timing of funding. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the future benefits to be paid to plan participants. The present value is calculated using a discount rate that is determined at the end of each year. Historically low interest rates over the last few years have significantly increased our benefit obligation. This has contributed to a lower funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as determined by GAAP. The funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined by the PPA. This ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. The ERISA liability does not reflect anticipated future pay increases for plan participants as required under GAAP and is currently measured using a higher discount rate than for GAAP, primarily due to The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) which provides temporary funding relief due to the historically low interest rate environment. By way of contrast, under ERISA our plans are about 90% funded at December 31, 2012 and 2011, while for GAAP our defined benefit pension plans are about 67% funded at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations. The primary year-end assumptions used to determine the funded status and estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and employee turnover and mortality for all postretirement benefit plans; funding levels; the expected rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. These assumptions we make impact both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets as well as funding levels in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. When reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We selected 4.00% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 related to our defined benefit pension plans, compared to 4.75% at the end of 2011 and 5.50% at the end of 2010. We selected 3.75% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 related to our retiree medical plans, compared to 4.50% at the end of 2011 and 5.50% at the end of 2010. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate 48 Table of Contents discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. We concluded that 8.00% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2012, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2011, and we used 8.50% at December 31, 2010. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $13.5 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of the December 31, 2012 adjustment of $3.2 billion. These non-cash, after-tax amounts primarily represent net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates and differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions, which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately 10 years. During 2012, $858 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and $1.0 billion is expected to be recognized as expense in 2013. If in the future we were to have a deficit in stockholders’ equity as a result of further adjustments associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plans, the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenants nor do we anticipate the deficit to hinder our ability to pay dividends and make stock repurchases as further described in the “Capital Structure, Resources, and Other” section above. We expect that our 2013 pension expense will be $1.9 billion, which is comparable to our 2012 pension expense. An increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above was offset by an increase in the expected dollar amount of return on plan assets primarily due to the $2.5 billion of discretionary contributions to the qualified defined benefit plans in the fourth quarter of 2012. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.00% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2012, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2012 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.00% discount rate at December 31, 2012 that was used to compute the expected 2013 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2013 would be lower or higher by approximately $145 million. If the 8.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2012 that was used to compute the expected 2013 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2013 would be lower or higher by approximately $80 million. Funding Considerations The PPA became applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011 and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions. We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $3.6 billion in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2011, and $2.2 billion in 2010, inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. We recovered $1.1 billion in 2012, $899 million in 2011 and $988 million in 2010 as CAS costs. Amounts funded under CAS are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS funding requirements, over $8.0 billion inclusive of interest as of December 31, 2012, are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. We would expect our required contributions to be temporarily lowered beginning in 2013 through 2015 as a result of MAP-21. We expect to make contributions of $1.5 billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2013 and anticipate recovering $1.5 billion as CAS cost on our contracts in 2013. The CAS Board published its revised pension accounting rules (CAS Harmonization) with an effective date of February 27, 2012 to better align the recovery of pension contributions, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government 49 Table of Contents contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the PPA. The CAS Harmonization rules increase our CAS cost beginning in 2013. There is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules is phased in, with the full impact occurring in 2017. The incremental impact of CAS Harmonization in 2013 is a very modest CAS cost increase, and we expect much larger increases will occur successively in years 2014 through 2017. Based upon current assumptions which may change, we expect that the increase in CAS costs caused by CAS Harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now, as our CAS costs would be in excess of the pension expense we record under GAAP. Accordingly, we expect our non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, discussed further in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section above, will soon increase earnings rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years. In addition, we expect that our future CAS pension recoveries will soon be equal to or greater than our required pension contributions, which should increase our cash flow from operations. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $950 million and $932 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $821 million and $808 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 12 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments, and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). Both the EPA and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment announced plans in January 2011 to regulate two chemicals, perchlorate and hexavalent chromium, to levels in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goals or standards established in California. The rulemaking processes are lengthy and may take years to complete. If substantially lower standards are adopted, we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding 50 Table of Contents environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill Our goodwill balances were $10.4 billion and $10.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires judgment to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. We initially test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels as well as goodwill. The corporate allocations include our postretirement benefit plans liabilities as determined in accordance with CAS in order to align the basis of the carrying values with the fair values of our reporting units. CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is allocated to and recognized in the estimated fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for CAS is currently higher than the discount rate used for GAAP, but is expected to trend downward over the next few years and would increase the amount of CAS liabilities allocated to each reporting unit, contributing to a decline in the carrying value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public trading values and values observed in market transactions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, discount rates, perpetual growth rates, and relevant comparable company earnings multiples and transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions; changes in working capital; long-term business plans; and recent operating performance. The 51 Table of Contents discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on our weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2012 we tested goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units, including the reporting units of our former Electronic Systems business segment and the reporting units of our new MFC and MST business segments. The results of our 2012 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, as such, no impairment existed. The fair value of each reporting unit was premised on the assumption that sequestration does not occur as it remains difficult to determine when and how sequestration would be implemented; that the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our programs, which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through March 27, 2013; and that Congress approves defense budget legislation for the U.S. Government’s fiscal year 2013 at a level consistent with the President’s proposed defense budget for the second half of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year 2013. While the specific effects of sequestration cannot be determined, we expect that across-the-board reductions would cause our sales, profits, and cash flows to be lower than our current projections. Such circumstances could eventually result in an impairment of our goodwill. Certain of our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our IS&GS business segment and certain services businesses within our MFC and MST business segments. However, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near-term, as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying values. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding assumptions about expected future sales, profits, and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Income Taxes We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time increase to income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $6.1 billion and $5.7 billion, based on a 35% Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If the Federal statutory income tax rate had been lowered to 25% at December 31, 2012, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $1.7 billion, and we would have recorded a corresponding, one time increase in income tax expense of $1.7 billion. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the annual re-measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We adopted a new accounting standard during 2012, which resulted only in a change in how we present other comprehensive loss in our consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For more information, see the “Recent accounting pronouncements” section within “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. As bond yields are at historical lows and move inversely to bond prices, the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $8.2 billion at December 31, 2012, and the outstanding principal amount was $7.2 billion, excluding unamortized discounts of $892 million. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2012. We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate economic exposures. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items, or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $503 million and $450 million. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (Note 15). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2012 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our cash flows. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2012, investments in the trust totaled $874 million and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our Statements of Earnings in other unallocated costs, and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2012. 53 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:40.830818
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2014,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Business Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2013, 82% of our $45.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 17% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government), and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology, including cyber security. We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Mission Systems and Training (MST), and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We are operating in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of both our domestic and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives as demonstrated by our plan to close and consolidate several of our facilities as we announced in November 2013. We also expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return at least 50% of free cash flow1 to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We expect 2014 net sales will decline slightly from 2013 due to projected lower net sales at Space Systems and IS&GS, partially offset by an anticipated increase in net sales at Aeronautics. We expect our 2014 segment operating profit will also decrease from 2013 at a slightly higher percentage rate than the decline in net sales due an anticipated decrease in segment operating profit at each of our business segments, with the exception of Aeronautics. Accordingly, segment operating profit margin is also expected to be lower than 2013 levels. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Funding Constraints The U.S. Government, our principal customer, continues to face significant fiscal and economic challenges such as financial deficits, budget uncertainty, increasing debt levels, and an economy with restrained growth. In order to address these challenges, the U.S. Government continues to focus on discretionary spending, entitlement programs, taxes, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. In doing so, the Administration and Congress must balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment largely imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act). The Budget Control Act established limits on discretionary spending, which provided for reductions to planned defense spending of $487 billion over a 10 year period that began with government fiscal year (GFY) 2012 (a U.S. Government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30). The Budget Control Act also provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, which went into effect on March 1, 2013, that would reduce planned defense spending by another $500 billion over a nine-year period that began in GFY 2013. These additional spending reductions are arbitrary as they would be applied across-the-board to numerous programs and contracts without regard to national priorities. While the defense budget will sustain the largest single reduction, other civil agencies and programs are also impacted by significant spending reductions. In light of the Budget Control Act and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending by the U.S. Government will remain constrained for a number of years. 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 24 Table of Contents For GFY 2013, which ended on September 30, 2013, sequestration resulted in a $37 billion reduction to the defense budget in addition to reductions as a result of the discretionary spending limits already imposed under the Budget Control Act. The impacts of sequestration in GFY 2013 were less than originally expected due to congressional actions that reduced the cuts as well as the DoD’s ability to allocate a portion of the reductions to prior year unobligated balances and multi-year investment appropriations. Accordingly, we have experienced minimal impacts to date. In December 2013, Congress and the Administration enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Bipartisan Budget Act). Notably, the Bipartisan Budget Act increased the limits on discretionary spending for GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 imposed by the Budget Control Act, among other fiscal changes. In particular, the Bipartisan Budget Act allows for approximately $63 billion of additional funding, including approximately $22 billion and $9 billion for defense spending during GFY 2014 and GFY 2015, respectively, and similar amounts for nondefense programs over the same period. The revised defense spending limits are set at approximately $520 billion for GFY 2014 and approximately $521 billion for GFY 2015. This agreement allows for more certainty in the budget planning process and provides the DoD the flexibility to better address its priorities. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act retains the lower spending limits, including the across-the-board spending reduction methodology, for GFYs 2016 through 2021 as provided for in the Budget Control Act. As a result, there remains uncertainty regarding how sequester cuts beyond GFY 2015 will be applied as the DoD and other agencies may have significantly less flexibility regarding how to allocate cuts in future years. While we have not yet seen the specific budget allocations by program, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources. On January 17, 2014, the U.S. Government passed its GFY 2014 budget to finance all activities through September 30, 2014, the end of its current fiscal year, after operating under continuing resolution temporary funding measures from October 1, 2013 to January 18, 2014. The budget provides discretionary defense spending at levels consistent with the planned defense spending limits in the Bipartisan Budget Act and eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procuring products and services under the continuing resolution. Under continuing resolutions, partial-year funding is available at prior year levels, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Other Matters While the recent budget actions provide a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the U.S. Government’s fiscal challenges, sequestration remains a long-term concern. If not further modified, sequestration could have significant negative impacts on our industry and company in future periods. There may be disruption of ongoing programs, impacts to our supply chain, contractual actions (including partial or complete terminations), potential facilities closures, and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry that will severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge. Sequestration, or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration, could have a material negative effect on our company as would any failure to address issues raised by the debt ceiling. Additionally, we are seeking to lessen our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government by focusing on expanding into adjacent markets close to our core capabilities and growing international sales but may not be successful in this strategy. Despite the continued uncertainty surrounding U.S. Government budgets, the investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. The possibility remains, however, that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S. Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, the implementation of sequestration (particularly in those circumstances where sequestration is implemented across-the-board without regard to national priorities), or other budget cuts in lieu of sequestration. Additionally, decreases in production volume associated with sequestration, or other budget cuts in lieu of sequestration, will increase unit costs making our products less affordable for both our domestic and international customers. Sequestration may also result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base. Such activity could result in claims from our suppliers, which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreements, the costs of evaluating the supplier settlement proposals, and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements. Furthermore, sequestration, or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration, could result in severance charges. We expect costs associated with claims from our suppliers and severance charges will be recovered from our customers. Generally, we expect that the impact of sequestration or other budget reductions in lieu of sequestration on our operating results will lag in certain of our businesses with longer cycles such as our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and our products businesses within our MFC and MST business segments, due to our production contract backlog. However, our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our IS&GS business segment and certain services businesses within our MFC and MST business segments. 25 Table of Contents Other Business Considerations International Business A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on expanding our in-country presence and strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and local production joint technology offices. For example, in 2013 we acquired Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company, and we opened a new in-country office in Saudi Arabia that will enable development of partnerships to create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace, and security sectors. We conduct business with international customers primarily through our Aeronautics, MFC, and MST business segments. In our Aeronautics business segment, there remains strong international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program includes commitments from eight international partner countries and two international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35. The international role on the program is growing as we opened the final assembly and checkout facility in Italy and began international pilot and maintainer training in 2013. We delivered three F-35 aircraft to international partners in 2013, including two aircraft to the Netherlands and one aircraft to the United Kingdom. The number of F-35 aircraft for international customers in recent low-rate initial production (LRIP) contracts continues to increase, with the LRIP 6 and 7 contracts including new aircraft awards for Australia, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. The award from Iraq in 2013 for 18 additional F-16 aircraft extends production through the middle of 2017. Also, we delivered the first C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to both the Republic of Tunisia and to Israel in 2013. The delivery to Tunisia marks the first to an African country. Our MFC business segment produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air and missile defense systems, which continue to generate significant international interest. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. During 2013, we received an award to provide PAC-3 missile defense equipment to Kuwait. Other international customers include Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 2013, we also finalized the multi-billion dollar award for the THAAD missile defense system from the UAE, which is the first international customer for this system. Other countries in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. In our MST business segment, we continue to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Canada, Japan, Spain, Korea, and Australia. In 2013, we received an award from Japan to upgrade processors and other equipment on their ballistic missile defense ships. The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is another significant program generating interest from potential international customers. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of a development contract and multiple production contracts. The development contract is being performed concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the development portion of the F-35 program will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and two international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. On the development contract, the U.S. Government continues to complete various operational tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations, and weapons testing, with the aircraft surpassing 10,000 flight hours. In 2013, we reduced the profit booking rate on the development contract after revising our estimate of fees that we expect to earn on the contract as well as our estimates of the remaining costs to complete the development contract. These revisions collectively reduced profit by $85 million during 2013, which reflect the inception-to-date impact of the change in the profit booking rate. Progress continues to be made on the production of aircraft. In 2013, the F-35 program reached a significant milestone as we completed the assembly of the 100th aircraft. During 2013, we delivered 35 aircraft to our domestic and international partners, resulting in total deliveries of 73 production aircraft as of December 31, 2013. We have 93 production aircraft in backlog as of December 31, 2013, including orders from our international partners. 26 Table of Contents Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with lifecycle operations and sustainment, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, and findings resulting from testing. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities, and through acquisition, divestiture, and internal realignment activities. Internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, and equity investments. Acquisitions We paid $269 million and $259 million in 2013 and 2012 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of businesses. In 2013, we acquired Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company specializing in information technology, civil government services, and the energy market. This acquisition is aligned with our strategy to grow international sales and has been included in our IS&GS business segment. In 2012, we acquired Chandler/May, Inc. (Chandler/May), CDL Systems Ltd. (CDL), and Procerus Technologies, L.C. (Procerus). These companies specialize in the design, development, manufacturing, control, and support of advanced unmanned systems, which expand our offerings in support of our customers’ increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our strategy to maintain a portfolio of advanced technology options. These companies are part of our MST business segment where they have been integrated into our portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies to align their product and service offerings to the U.S. Army. In 2011, we paid $624 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of QTC Holdings Inc. (QTC) and Sim-Industries B.V. (Sim-Industries). QTC provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the U.S. Government and has been included within our IS&GS business segment. Sim-Industries designs, develops, and manufactures full-motion and fixed-based civil aviation flight simulators for a wide range of airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide and is part of our MST business segment. These companies complement our core capabilities and align with our strategy to expand into closely related markets and expand our customer base. For additional information, see “Note 14 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. Divestitures In pursuing our business strategies, we have also divested certain businesses over the past three years. Recent divestitures consisted of Savi Technology, Inc. (Savi) in 2012 and Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE) in 2011. For additional information, see “Note 14 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development, and manufacturing of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2013 2012 2011 Operating results Net sales $ 45,358 $ 47,182 $ 46,499 Cost of sales (41,171 ) (42,986 ) (42,755) Other income, net 318 238 276 Operating profit 4,505 4,434 4,020 Interest expense (350 ) (383 ) (354) Other non-operating income (expense), net — 21 (35) Income tax expense (1,205 ) (1,327 ) (964) Net earnings from continuing operations 2,950 2,745 2,667 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations 31 — (12) Net earnings $ 2,981 $ 2,745 $ 2,655 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share Continuing operations $ 9.04 $ 8.36 $ 7.85 Discontinued operations .09 — (.04) Total $ 9.13 $ 8.36 $ 7.81 Amounts reported in other income, net (primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees) on our Statements of Earnings are included in the segment operating profit and segment operating margins of our “Business Segment Results of Operations” but are excluded from the consolidated net sales and cost of sales tables below. Net Sales Products sales are predominantly generated in our Aeronautics, MFC, MST, and Space Systems business segments, and most of our services sales are generated in our IS&GS and MFC business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales Products $35,691 $37,817 $36,925 Services 9,667 9,365 9,574 Total net sales $45,358 $47,182 $46,499 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our “Business Segment Results of Operations” section because, due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales. Products Sales Our products sales represent about 80% of our net sales for both 2013 and 2012. Products sales decreased $2.1 billion, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower volume and deliveries. Products sales decreased about $915 million at Aeronautics primarily due to fewer aircraft deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-130) and lower volume and risk retirements on F-22 due to completion of aircraft deliveries in 2012, partially offset by increased volume and risk retirements on F-35 production contracts and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-5 program; about $750 million at IS&GS for various programs due to lower volume (such as Next Generation Identification (NGI) and En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) 28 Table of Contents programs); about $440 million at MST due to fewer deliveries (primarily Persistent Threat Detection Systems (PTDS) as final surveillance system deliveries occurred during the second quarter of 2012) and lower volume (primarily integrated warfare systems and sensors programs); and about $405 million at Space Systems due to lower volume (primarily commercial satellites and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) program) partially offset by increased volume (primarily various government satellite programs). The decreases were partially offset by higher products sales of about $380 million at MFC due to increased volume and risk retirements (primarily THAAD and deliveries of PAC-3). Our products sales represent about 80% of our net sales for both 2012 and 2011. Products sales increased $892 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher volume and deliveries, as well as higher risk retirements on certain programs. Products sales increased about $555 million at Aeronautics due to increased volume and risk retirements on F-35 production contracts and deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-5), partially offset by decreased volume and risk retirements (primarily F-22); about $510 million at MST due to increased deliveries (primarily PTDS) and increased volume (primarily LCS); about $225 million at Space Systems due to increased volume (primarily commercial satellites and Orion); and about $100 million at MFC due to increased volume (primarily THAAD and PAC-3). These increases partially were offset by lower products sales of about $495 million at IS&GS due to the substantial completion of certain programs (such as Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and U.K. Census). Services Sales Our services sales represent about 20% of our net sales for 2013 and 2012. Services sales increased $302 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Services sales increased about $270 million at IS&GS primarily due to the start-up of certain programs (such as the Defense Information Systems Agency – Global Information Grid Services Management-Operations (DISA GSM-O) and the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support); and about $85 million at Aeronautics primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily F-16). The increases were partially offset by lower services sales of about $80 million at MFC for various technical services programs due to lower volume, partially offset by various fire control programs (primarily Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS)) due to higher volume. Services sales for 2013 were comparable to 2012 at both MST and Space Systems. Our services sales represent about 20% of our net sales for 2012 and 2011. Services sales decreased $209 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to 2011. Services sales decreased about $105 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume and risk retirements on various technical services programs. Services sales decreased about $60 million at MST primarily due to lower volume on various training services programs. Services sales decreased about $40 million at IS&GS primarily due to the substantial completion of the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA (ODIN) during 2011 and lower volume on the Hanford Mission Support (Hanford) contract, partially offset by higher net sales from QTC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative). For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs at the completion of the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Cost of sales Cost of products sales $ 31,346 $ 33,495 $ 32,968 % of products sales 87.8 % 88.6 % 89.3% Cost of services sales 8,588 8,383 8,514 % of services sales 88.8 % 89.5 % 88.9% Goodwill impairment charge 195 — — Severance charges 201 48 136 Other unallocated costs 841 1,060 1,137 Total cost of sales $ 41,171 $ 42,986 $ 42,755 Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of products and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of products and services sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our “Business Segment Results of Operations” section. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of products and services sales that would have a material impact on our future operations. 29 Table of Contents Cost of Products Sales Cost of products sales decreased $2.1 billion, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower volume and deliveries. Cost of products sales decreased about $770 million at Aeronautics due to fewer aircraft deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-130) and lower volume (primarily F-22), partially offset by increased volume for F-35 production contracts, increased aircraft deliveries and the impact of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 for the C-5 program and lower risk retirements on various programs (primarily C-130); about $685 million at IS&GS for various programs primarily due to decreased volume; about $570 million at MST primarily due to fewer deliveries and net increased risk retirements for the PTDS program and various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs and for the favorable resolution of certain contract cost matters (including the terminated presidential helicopter program); and about $315 million at Space Systems due to lower volume (primarily commercial satellites and Orion). The decreases were partially offset by higher cost of products sales of about $190 million at MFC due to increased volume (primarily THAAD and deliveries of PAC-3), partially offset by various other programs due increased risk retirements (primarily fire control programs). The 0.8% decrease in the percentage of cost of products sales relative to products sales in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily was due to higher risk retirements (primarily at MFC and MST) and the favorable resolution of contractual matters at MST. Cost of products sales increased $527 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher volume and deliveries. Cost of products sales increased about $520 million at Aeronautics due to increased volume (primarily F-35 production contracts) and increased deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-5); about $485 million at MST due to increased deliveries (primarily PTDS) and volume (primarily LCS), partially offset by reserves of about $55 million for contract cost matters on certain contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 (including the terminated presidential helicopter program); and about $180 million at Space Systems due to increased volume (primarily commercial satellites programs, Orion and various strategic and defensive missile programs). The increases were partially offset by lower cost of products sales of about $530 million at IS&GS primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 and lower volume on various other programs; and about $70 million at MFC due to higher risk retirements (primarily tactical missile and fire control programs) and the favorable resolution of contractual matters, partially offset by increased deliveries (PAC-3) and volume (THAAD). The 0.7% decrease in the percentage of cost of products sales relative to products sales in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily was due to higher risk retirements (primarily at MFC) as well as the favorable resolution of contractual matters at MFC and higher risk retirements and lower reserves on ship and aviation system programs at MST. Cost of Services Sales Our cost of services sales increased $205 million, or 2%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Most of our cost of services sales are in the IS&GS and MFC business segments. The increase in cost of services sales was primarily attributable to higher cost of services sales at our IS&GS and Aeronautics business segments partially offset by lower cost of services sales at our MFC business segment. Cost of services sales increased about $245 million at IS&GS primarily due to the start-up of various programs. Cost of services sales increased about $40 million at Aeronautics primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily F-16). Cost of services sales decreased about $75 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume of various technical services programs, partially offset by higher volume from various fire control programs (primarily SOF CLSS). The 0.7% decrease in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts at Aeronautics. Our cost of services sales decreased $131 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in cost of services sales primarily was attributable to lower cost of services sales at our MFC and MST business segments, partially offset by higher cost of services sales at our IS&GS business segment. Cost of services sales decreased approximately $105 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on various technical services programs. Cost of services sales decreased approximately $90 million at MST primarily due to lower volume on various training services programs. Cost of services sales increased approximately $80 million at IS&GS primarily due to higher net sales from QTC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011, and various other services programs partially offset by lower costs from the substantial completion of ODIN in 2011 and lower volume on the Hanford contract. The 0.6% increase in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to risk retirements on the ODIN and Hanford contracts in 2011. Goodwill Impairment Charge In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $195 million, net of state tax benefits, which reduced our net earnings by $176 million ($.54 per share). The charge related to the Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment and was due to the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures on the Technical Services business, which typically has smaller customer contracts of a shorter duration. For additional information, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Goodwill” section below and “Note 1 –Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges 2013 Actions During 2013, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $201 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $83 million, $37 million, and $81 million related to our IS&GS, MST, and Space Systems business segments. These charges reduced our net earnings by $130 million ($.40 per share) and primarily related to a plan we committed to in November 2013 to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce our total workforce by approximately 4,000 positions within our IS&GS, MST, and Space Systems business segments. These charges also include $30 million related to certain severance actions at our IS&GS business segment that occurred in the first quarter of 2013, which were subsequently paid in 2013. The November 2013 plan resulted from a strategic review of these businesses’ facility capacity and future workload projections and is intended to better align our organization and cost structure and improve the affordability of our products and services given the continued decline in U.S. Government spending as well as the rapidly changing competitive and economic landscape. Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. During 2013, we paid approximately $15 million in severance payments associated with these actions, with the remainder expected to be paid through the middle of 2015. In addition to the severance charges described above, we expect to incur accelerated and incremental costs (e.g., accelerated depreciation expense related to long-lived assets at the sites to be closed, relocation of equipment and other employee related costs) of approximately $15 million, $50 million, and $135 million at our IS&GS, MST, and Space Systems business segments related to the facility closures and consolidations. The accelerated and incremental costs will be expensed as incurred in the respective business segment’s results of operations through their completion in 2015. We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. Of the total accelerated and incremental costs to be incurred mentioned above, we expect $25 million, net of recoveries, at MST and $55 million, net of recoveries, at Space Systems will be incurred in 2014. Also, we expect the restructuring charges will reduce our 2014 cash flow from operations by approximately $150 million, mostly due to expected severance payments in 2014. 2012 and 2011 Actions During 2012, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $48 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $25 million related to our Aeronautics business segment and $23 million related to the reorganization of our former Electronic Systems business segment. These charges reduced our net earnings by $31 million ($.09 per share) and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. These severance actions resulted from cost reduction initiatives to better align our organization with changing economic conditions. Upon separation, terminated employees received lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, all of which were paid in 2013. During 2011, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $136 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $49 million, $48 million, and $39 million related to our Aeronautics, Space Systems, and our IS&GS business segments and Corporate Headquarters. These charges reduced our net earnings by $88 million ($.26 per share) and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. These severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our Corporate Headquarters and are intended to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. The workforce reductions at the business segments also reflected changes in program lifecycles, where several of our major programs were either transitioning out of development and into production or were ending. Upon separation, terminated employees received lump-sum severance payments based on years of service. During 2011, we made approximately half of the severance payments associated with these 2011 severance actions, and paid the remaining amounts in 2012. Other Unallocated Costs Other unallocated costs principally include FAS/CAS pension expense, stock-based compensation, and other corporate costs. These costs are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the costs of products and services sales (see “Note 4 – Information on Business Segments” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of these items). The decreases of $219 million and $77 million in other unallocated costs from 2012 to 2013 and 2011 to 2012 31 Table of Contents were primarily attributable to the decrease in FAS/CAS pension expense, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. We expect FAS/CAS pension income of $345 million in 2014 as further discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” section below. Other Income, Net Other income, net for 2013 was $318 million, compared to $238 million in 2012 and $276 million in 2011. The changes between years primarily were due to fluctuations in equity earnings in investees in our Space Systems business segment, as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2013 was $350 million, compared to $383 million in 2012 and $354 million in 2011. The decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt from the December 2012 debt exchange (Note 9). The increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to increased interest expense from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt in September 2011, partially offset by the redemption of $500 million in certain long-term notes in October 2011 (Note 9). Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net Other non-operating income, net decreased $21 million from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2012. Other non-operating income (expense), net was $21 million in 2012 and $(35) million in 2011, with the change between years primarily due to premiums of $48 million on early extinguishments of debt that occurred in 2011 (Note 9). Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.0% for 2013, 32.6% for 2012, and 26.5% for 2011. The rates generally benefit from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature. The U.S. manufacturing deduction benefit for 2013 and 2011 reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points as compared to 2012. These fluctuations between years occurred because our tax-deductible discretionary pension contributions of $2.5 billion in 2012, which reduced U.S. manufacturing deduction benefits by $59 million ($.18 per share), were significantly higher than in 2013 or 2011. Our effective income tax rate for 2013 was reduced by approximately two percentage points because of U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credits. On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which retroactively reinstated the R&D tax credit for two years, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. As the effects of tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, $37 million ($.11 per share) of tax benefit attributable to 2012 was recorded during 2013, in addition to $39 million ($.12 per share) of tax benefit attributable to 2013. Since we recorded two years of R&D tax credit in 2013, we expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2014 whether or not Congress reenacts the R&D tax credit for 2014. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was increased by approximately one percentage point due to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 (Note 1), as only a portion of the charge will qualify for a tax deduction. Our effective income tax rate for 2011 was reduced by approximately two and one-half percentage points because in April 2011 the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Appeals Division’s resolution of certain adjustments related to our tax years 2003 through 2008. As a result, we recognized additional tax benefits and reduced our income tax expense for 2011 by $89 million ($.26 per share). Our effective income tax rate for 2011 also was reduced by approximately one percentage point due to R&D tax credits. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time 32 Table of Contents increase to income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $3.9 billion and $6.1 billion, based on a 35% Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If the Federal statutory income tax rate had been lowered to 25% at December 31, 2013, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $1.1 billion, and we would have recorded a corresponding, one time increase in income tax expense of $1.1 billion. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the annual measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.95 billion ($9.04 per share) in 2013, $2.75 billion ($8.36 per share) in 2012, and $2.67 billion ($7.85 per share) in 2011. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. Net Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2013 included a benefit of $31 million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to a business previously sold. Discontinued operations for 2011 included the operating results and other adjustments of Savi, a logistics business sold in 2012 that was in our former Electronic Systems business segment, and PAE, a business sold in 2011 that was formerly within our IS&GS business segment. Net loss from discontinued operations was $12 million ($.04 per share) in 2011, and included a deferred tax asset of $66 million that we expected to realize on the sale of Savi because our tax basis was higher than our book basis. This tax benefit was largely offset by operating losses and other adjustments. For more information, see “Note 14 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, IS&GS, MFC, MST, and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions that share many similar characteristics (e.g., contract structures, funding profiles, target cost values, contract progress reports) with our third-party contracts, primarily with the U.S. Government. Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of those business segments. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairment (Note 1) and significant severance actions (Note 2); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 14); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated expenses, net” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. The results of operations of our business segments include pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. CAS governs the extent to which pension costs can be allocated to and recovered on U.S. Government contracts. The CAS cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. 33 Table of Contents The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (Note 14) for all years presented. Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales Aeronautics $ 14,123 $ 14,953 $ 14,362 Information Systems & Global Solutions 8,367 8,846 9,381 Missiles and Fire Control 7,757 7,457 7,463 Mission Systems and Training 7,153 7,579 7,132 Space Systems 7,958 8,347 8,161 Total net sales $ 45,358 $ 47,182 $ 46,499 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,612 $ 1,699 $ 1,630 Information Systems & Global Solutions 759 808 874 Missiles and Fire Control 1,431 1,256 1,069 Mission Systems and Training 905 737 645 Space Systems 1,045 1,083 1,063 Total business segment operating profit 5,752 5,583 5,281 Unallocated expenses, net FAS/CAS pension adjustment FAS pension expense (1,948 ) (1,941 ) (1,821) Less: CAS cost 1,466 1,111 899 FAS/CAS pension expense (a) (482 ) (830 ) (922) Goodwill impairment charge (b) (195 ) — — Severance charges (c) (201 ) (48 ) (136) Stock-based compensation (189 ) (167 ) (157) Other, net (180 ) (104 ) (46) Total unallocated expenses, net (1,247 ) (1,149 ) (1,261) Total consolidated operating profit $ 4,505 $ 4,434 $ 4,020 (a) We expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2014 of about $345 million as further discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” section below. (b) We recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment. For more information, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. (c) See “Note 2 – Restructuring Charges” of our consolidated financial statements for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments and Corporate Headquarters. Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $82.6 billion, $82.3 billion, and $80.7 billion at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $55.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft), and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated costs to provide the product or service. 34 Table of Contents This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. In the discussion of comparative segment results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our sales, segment operating profit, and segment operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and segment operating margins may also be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above; cost recoveries on all restructuring charges; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and insurance recoveries; among others. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates, or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased segment operating profit, net of state income taxes, by approximately $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2013, 2012, and 2011. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our MST and MFC business segments and, to a lesser extent, the increase in the favorable resolution of contractual matters for the corporation. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments and the favorable resolution of contractual matters at our MST and MFC business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2013 and 2012 are inclusive of approximately $600 million and $500 million in unfavorable items, which include a significant profit reduction on the F-35 development contract in both years, as well as a significant profit reduction on the C-5 program in 2013, each as described in our Aeronautics business segment’s results of operations discussion below. Unfavorable items in 2012 were about $100 million higher than 2011, primarily due to a significant profit reduction on the F-35 development contract in 2012 as mentioned above. 35 Table of Contents Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales $ 14,123 $ 14,953 $ 14,362 Operating profit 1,612 1,699 1,630 Operating margins 11.4 % 11.4 % 11.3% Backlog at year-end 28,000 30,100 30,500 2013 compared to 2012 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2013 decreased $830 million, or 6%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $530 million for the F-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (13 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 37 delivered in 2012) partially offset by aircraft configuration mix; about $385 million for the C-130 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (25 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 34 in 2012) partially offset by increased sustainment activities; approximately $255 million for the F-22 program, which includes about $205 million due to decreased production volume as final aircraft deliveries were completed during the second quarter of 2012 and $50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter during the second quarter of 2012; and about $270 million for various other programs (primarily sustainment activities) due to decreased volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $295 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements; approximately $245 million for the C-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries (six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012) and other modernization activities; and about $70 million for the F-35 development contract due to increased volume. Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2013 decreased $87 million, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $85 million for the F-22 program, which includes approximately $50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume; approximately $70 million for the C-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities; about $65 million for the C-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements; approximately $35 million for the F-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix. The decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $180 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit was comparable for the F-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $75 million lower for 2013 compared to 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2012 increased $591 million, or 4%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $745 million from F-35 production contracts principally due to increased production volume; about $285 million from F-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries (37 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers; and approximately $140 million from C-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries (four C-5M aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the F-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012; approximately $110 million from the F-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume; and about $95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other Aeronautics programs due to higher volume. Net sales for C-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries. 36 Table of Contents Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2012 increased $69 million, or 4%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $105 million from C-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements; about $50 million from F-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements; approximately $50 million from F-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements; and about $50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain F-16 contracts. Partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $90 million from the F-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012; approximately $50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the F-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012; and approximately $45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other Aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit for C-5 programs was comparable to 2011. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on F-16, C-5, and C-130 programs, partially offset by higher orders on the F-35 program. Backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on F-35 and C-130 programs, partially offset by higher orders on F-16 programs. Trends We expect Aeronautics’ net sales to increase in 2014 in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net sales from F-35 production contracts. Operating profit is expected to increase slightly from 2013, resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between the years due to program mix. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise, integrated information technology solutions, and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS has been impacted by the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets. IS&GS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales $ 8,367 $ 8,846 $ 9,381 Operating profit 759 808 874 Operating margins 9.1 % 9.1 % 9.3% Backlog at year-end 8,300 8,700 9,300 2013 compared to 2012 IS&GS’ net sales decreased $479 million, or 5%, for 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of about $495 million due to decreased volume on various programs (command and control programs for classified customers, NGI, and ERAM programs); and approximately $320 million due to the completion of certain programs (such as Total Information Processing Support Services, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), and ODIN). The decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of about $340 million due to the start-up of certain programs (such as the DISA GSM-O and the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support). IS&GS’ operating profit decreased $49 million, or 6%, for 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $55 million due to certain programs nearing the end of their lifecycles, partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $15 million due to the start-up of certain programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were comparable for 2013 compared to 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 IS&GS’ net sales for 2012 decreased $535 million, or 6%, compared to 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 (primarily JTRS; ODIN; and U.K. Census); and about $255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs (primarily Hanford; 37 Table of Contents Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T); Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC); and TWIC). Partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately $140 million from QTC, which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011; and about $65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs, primarily federal cyber security programs and PTDS operational support. IS&GS’ operating profit for 2012 decreased $66 million, or 8%, compared to 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $50 million due to the favorable impact of the ODIN contract completion in 2011; about $25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012; and approximately $20 million due to lower volume on certain programs (primarily C2BMC and WIN-T). Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $15 million from the TWIC program; and about $10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs, primarily federal cyber security programs and PTDS operational support. Operating profit for the JTRS program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower orders on several programs (such as ERAM and NGI), higher sales on certain programs (the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support and the DISA GSM-O), and declining activities on several smaller programs primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets. Backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs in 2011 (primarily ODIN, U.K. Census, and JTRS). Trends We expect IS&GS’ net sales to decline in 2014 in the high single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets. Operating profit is also expected to decline in 2014 in the high single digit percentage range consistent with the expected decline in net sales, resulting in margins that are comparable with 2013 results. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics and other technical services; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Javelin, Apache Fire Control System (Apache), Sniper®, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®), and SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales $ 7,757 $ 7,457 $ 7,463 Operating profit 1,431 1,256 1,069 Operating margins 18.4 % 16.8 % 14.3 % Backlog at year-end 15,000 14,700 14,400 2013 compared to 2012 MFC’s net sales for 2013 increased $300 million, or 4%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $450 million for air and missile defense programs (THAAD and PAC-3) due to increased production volume and deliveries; about $70 million for fire control programs due to net increased deliveries and volume; and approximately $55 million for tactical missile programs due to net increased deliveries. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $275 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume driven by the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures. The increase for fire control programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on the Sniper® and LANTIRN® programs, increased volume on the SOF CLSS program, partially offset by lower volume on Longbow Fire Control Radar and other programs. The increase for tactical missile programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on JASSM and other programs, partially offset by fewer deliveries on the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System and Javelin programs. 38 Table of Contents MFC’s operating profit for 2013 increased $175 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $85 million for air and missile defense programs (THAAD and PAC-3) due to increased risk retirements and volume; about $85 million for fire control programs (Sniper®, LANTIRN® and Apache) due to increased risk retirements and higher volume; and approximately $75 million for tactical missile programs (Hellfire and various programs) due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of about $45 million for the resolution of contractual matters in the second quarter of 2012; and approximately $15 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume partially offset by increased risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million higher for 2013 compared to 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 MFC’s net sales for 2012 were comparable to 2011. Net sales decreased approximately $130 million due to lower volume and risk retirements on various services programs, and about $60 million due to lower volume from fire control systems programs (primarily Sniper®; LANTIRN®; and Apache). The decreases largely were offset by higher net sales of approximately $95 million due to higher volume from tactical missile programs (primarily Javelin and Hellfire) and approximately $80 million for air and missile defense programs (primarily PAC-3 and THAAD). MFC’s operating profit for 2012 increased $187 million, or 17%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher risk retirements and volume of about $95 million from tactical missile programs (primarily Javelin and Hellfire); increased risk retirements and volume of approximately $60 million for air and missile defense programs (primarily THAAD and PAC-3); and about $45 million from a resolution of contractual matters. Partially offsetting these increases was lower risk retirements and volume on various programs, including $25 million for services programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $145 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. Backlog Backlog increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders on the THAAD program and lower sales volume compared to new orders on certain fire control systems programs in 2013, partially offset by lower orders on technical services programs and certain tactical missile programs. Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs (primarily LANTIRN® and Sniper®) and on various services programs, partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs. Trends We expect MFC’s net sales to be flat to slightly down in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in net sales on technical services programs partially offset by an increase in net sales from missiles and fire control programs. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single digit percentage range, driven by a reduction in expected risk retirements in 2014. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to slightly decline from 2013. Mission Systems and Training Our MST business segment provides ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. MST’s major programs include Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, MH-60, TPQ-53 Radar System, and MK-41 Vertical Launching System (VLS). MST’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales $ 7,153 $ 7,579 $ 7,132 Operating profit 905 737 645 Operating margins 12.7 % 9.7 % 9.0 % Backlog at year-end 10,800 10,700 10,500 2013 compared to 2012 MST’s net sales for 2013 decreased $426 million, or 6%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $275 million for various ship and aviation systems programs due to lower volume 39 Table of Contents (primarily PTDS as final surveillance system deliveries occurred during the second quarter of 2012); about $195 million for various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Naval systems) due to lower volume; approximately $65 million for various training and logistics programs due to lower volume; and about $55 million for the Aegis program due to lower volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $155 million for the LCS program due to increased volume. MST’s operating profit for 2013 increased $168 million, or 23%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlement of contract cost matters on certain programs (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program); about $55 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily radar and Halifax class modernization programs) due to increased risk retirements; and approximately $30 million for undersea systems programs due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of about $55 million for training and logistics programs, primarily due to the recording of approximately $30 million of charges mostly related to lower-of-cost-or-market considerations; and about $25 million for ship and aviation systems programs (primarily PTDS) due to lower risk retirements and volume. Operating profit related to the LCS program was comparable. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $170 million higher for 2013 compared to 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 MST’s net sales for 2012 increased $447 million, or 6%, compared to 2011. The increase in net sales for 2012 was attributable to higher volume and risk retirements of approximately $395 million from ship and aviation system programs (primarily PTDS; LCS; VLS; and MH-60); about $115 million for training and logistics solutions programs primarily due to net sales from Sim-Industries, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011; and approximately $30 million as a result of increased volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Aegis). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $70 million from undersea systems programs due to lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems; and about $25 million due to lower volume on various other programs. MST’s operating profit for 2012 increased $92 million, or 14%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $175 million from ship and aviation system programs, which reflects higher volume and risk retirements on certain programs (primarily VLS; PTDS; MH-60; and LCS) and reserves of about $55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). Partially offsetting the increase was lower operating profit of approximately $40 million from undersea systems programs due to reduced profit booking rates on certain programs and lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems; and about $40 million due to lower volume on various other programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above, were approximately $150 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. Backlog Backlog increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders and lower sales on integrated warfare system and sensors programs (primarily Aegis) and lower sales on various service programs, partially offset by lower orders on ship and aviation systems (primarily MH-60). Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily MH-60 and LCS), partially offset by decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Aegis). Trends We expect MST’s net sales to be flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low double digit percentage range from 2013 primarily due to the absence of favorable contractual resolutions that occurred in 2013 as described above and expected charges, net of recoveries, in 2014 for incremental costs related to the November 2013 restructuring plan as described in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” section above, resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Advanced Extremely High 40 Table of Contents Frequency (AEHF) system, Orion, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) III system, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space Systems business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net sales $ 7,958 $ 8,347 $ 8,161 Operating profit 1,045 1,083 1,063 Operating margins 13.1 % 13.0 % 13.0 % Backlog at year-end 20,500 18,100 16,000 2013 compared to 2012 Space Systems’ net sales for 2013 decreased $389 million, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $305 million for commercial satellite programs due to fewer deliveries (zero delivered during 2013 compared to two for 2012); and about $290 million for the Orion program due to lower volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $130 million for government satellite programs due to net increased volume; and about $65 million for strategic and defensive missile programs (primarily FBM) due to increased volume and risk retirements. The increase for government satellite programs was primarily attributable to higher volume on AEHF and other programs, partially offset by lower volume on GOES-R, MUOS, and SBIRS programs. Space Systems’ operating profit for 2013 decreased $38 million, or 4%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $50 million for the Orion program due to lower volume and risk retirements and about $30 million for government satellite programs due to decreased risk retirements, which were partially offset by higher equity earnings from joint ventures of approximately $35 million. The decrease in operating profit for government satellite programs was primarily attributable to lower risk retirements for MUOS, GPS III, and other programs, partially offset by higher risk retirements for the SBIRS and AEHF programs. Operating profit for 2013 included about $15 million of charges, net of recoveries, related to the November 2013 restructuring plan. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $15 million lower for 2013 compared to 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 Space Systems’ net sales for 2012 increased $186 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $150 million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries (two commercial satellites delivered in 2012 compared to one during 2011); about $125 million from the Orion program due to higher volume and an increase in risk retirements; and approximately $70 million from increased volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs. Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $105 million from certain government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) as a result of decreased volume and a decline in risk retirements; and about $55 million from the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Space Systems’ operating profit for 2012 increased $20 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $60 million from commercial satellite programs due to increased deliveries and reserves recorded in 2011; and about $40 million from the Orion program due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. Partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of approximately $45 million from lower volume and risk retirements on certain government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS); about $20 million from lower risk retirements and lower volume on the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011; and approximately $20 million from lower equity earnings as a decline in launch related activities at ULA partially was offset by the resolution of contract cost matters associated with the wind-down of United Space Alliance (USA). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments described above, were approximately $15 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. Equity earnings Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems (primarily ULA in 2013) represented approximately $300 million, or 29% of this segment’s operating profit during 2013. During 2012 and 2011, total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems from ULA, USA, and the U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment joint venture represented approximately $265 million and $285 million, or 24% and 27% of this segment’s operating profit. 41 Table of Contents Backlog Backlog increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders on the Orion program, partially offset by lower orders on government satellite programs (primarily AEHF). Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to higher orders on government satellites activities, partially offset by lower orders on the Orion program. Trends We expect Space Systems’ net sales to decline in 2014 in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in volume on satellite programs in 2014. Operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in 2014 primarily due to lower earnings on satellite programs, expected charges, net of recoveries, in 2014 for accelerated depreciation expense and incremental costs related to the November 2013 restructuring plan as described in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” section above, and lower equity earnings. As a result, operating margins are expected to decline between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business, including capital expenditures and independent research and development, returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, made selective acquisitions of businesses, and managed our debt levels. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, and postretirement benefit plan funding. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. Our cash balances and cash from operations have historically been sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, our liquidity and cash flows could be materially impacted in the future if the U.S. Government were to shut down due to impasses over budget and/or debt ceiling negotiations. As discussed in the “Capital Resources” section, we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, should they occur. We also have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2013, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. The amount of withholds was approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2012. We collected substantially all of this amount in 2013 as we resolved certain deficiencies related to U.S. Government audits of our business systems, primarily at our Aeronautics business segment. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2013 and those planned for 2014 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and information technology. Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. 42 Table of Contents In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities, inclusive of our efforts to consolidate and reduce leased facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 1,898 $ 3,582 $ 2,261 Operating activities Net earnings 2,981 2,745 2,655 Non-cash adjustments 1,570 2,133 1,210 Changes in working capital (98 ) (1,061 ) 674 Other, net 93 (2,256 ) (286) Net cash provided by operating activities 4,546 1,561 4,253 Net cash used for investing activities (1,121 ) (1,177 ) (788) Net cash used for financing activities (2,706 ) (2,068 ) (2,144) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 719 (1,684 ) 1,321 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 2,617 $ 1,898 $ 3,582 Operating Activities 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.0 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to lower pension contributions, a lower increase in working capital, a tax refund in 2013 as discussed below, and improved operating results. We made $2.25 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during 2013, compared to $3.6 billion during 2012. The $1.0 billion decline in the growth of working capital (defined as receivables, net and inventories, net less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to higher cash receipts related to accounts receivable, primarily on F-35 production contracts (including amounts from resolving U.S. Government contractual withholds). Partially offsetting the improved accounts receivable collections were higher payments to suppliers, primarily on F-35 production contracts. In addition, there was lower growth in inventories in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to the timing of advance payments applied to inventory. We made tax payments, net of refunds received, of $787 million during 2013, compared to $890 million during 2012. We expect our 2014 net tax payments will increase over our 2013 tax payments, which were reduced by a $550 million refund from the IRS primarily attributable to our tax-deductible discretionary pension contributions during the fourth quarter of 2012. 2012 compared to 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $2.7 billion in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to changes in working capital of $1.7 billion and increased pension contributions of $1.1 billion, net of CAS recoveries. The decrease of $1.7 billion in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was driven by higher payments of accounts payable due to timing as well as the timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories. Additionally, growth in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of finalizing contract negotiations on F-35 production contracts in the fourth quarter of 2012, which delayed our billings, as well as the impact of U.S. Government withholdings on the F-35 program reduced the cash provided by operating activities. Investing Activities Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures amounted to $836 million in 2013, $942 million in 2012, and $987 million in 2011. Acquisitions and other activities – Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $269 million in 2013 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of Amor Group (Note 14). In 2012, we paid $259 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Chandler/May, CDL, and 43 Table of Contents Procerus (Note 14). In 2011, we paid $624 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of QTC and Sim-Industries (Note 14). In 2011, we received cash of $510 million from the maturity of short-term investments. Financing Activities Dividends and share activity – We paid dividends totaling $1.5 billion ($4.78 per share) in 2013, $1.4 billion ($4.15 per share) in 2012, and $1.1 billion ($3.25 per share) in 2011. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2013. We declared quarterly dividends of $1.15 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2013 and $1.33 per share for the last quarter; $1.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2012 and $1.15 per share for the last quarter; and $.75 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2011 and $1.00 per share for the last quarter. We paid $1.8 billion, $1.0 billion, and $2.5 billion for repurchases of our common stock during 2013, 2012, and 2011. In September 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $3.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. We had total remaining authorization of $3.6 billion for future common share repurchases under our program as of December 31, 2013. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2013, 2012, and 2011 totaled $827 million, $440 million, and $116 million. Those exercises resulted in the issuance of 10.0 million shares, 6.7 million shares, and 2.3 million shares of our common stock during the respective periods. Long-term debt – In 2013, we repaid $150 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.38% due to their scheduled maturities. In 2012, we paid $225 million to complete an exchange of debt (Note 9) to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In 2011, we issued a total of $2.0 billion of long-term notes with fixed coupon rates ranging from 2.13% to 4.85%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term notes that were issued in 2011 to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we also repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases and paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. Capital Structure, Resources, and Other At December 31, 2013, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $450 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash was repatriated at the end of 2013, we estimate that about $50 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits. Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $6.2 billion, and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had in place with a group of banks a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in August 2016. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the credit facility by an additional amount up to $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility through December 31, 2013. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the credit facility. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the credit facility. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility, as well as in our debt agreements. We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2013. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through August 2014 to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, 44 Table of Contents amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Our stockholders’ equity increased from $39 million at December 31, 2012 to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase was due to the annual December 31 measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $2.9 billion, primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, and the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses of $1.0 billion in 2013; net earnings of $3.0 billion; and employee stock activity of $1.3 billion. These increases partially were offset by dividends declared of $1.6 billion during the year and the repurchase of 16.0 million common shares for $1.7 billion. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $434 million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2013, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 6,933 $ — $ 952 $ — $ 5,981 Interest payments 5,873 347 677 601 4,248 Other liabilities 2,656 248 443 377 1,588 Operating lease obligations 914 227 298 165 224 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 28,208 13,838 10,505 3,162 703 Capital expenditures 197 107 88 2 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 44,781 $ 14,767 $ 12,963 $ 4,307 $ 12,744 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2013. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $26.4 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do 45 Table of Contents not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2013, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $9.9 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC, and MST business segments, some of which extend through 2027. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2013 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2013, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have each received distributions totaling $527 million (since ULA’s formation in December 2006) which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing, and ULA, whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make required payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. Based on current expectations of ULA’s cash flow needs, we currently believe that ULA should have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity, including access to its $560 million revolving credit agreement from third-party financial institutions, to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2013, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2013, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $1,313 $ 964 $231 $101 $ 17 Surety bonds 358 358 — — — Guarantees 696 6 192 — 498 Total commitments $2,367 $1,328 $423 $101 $515 (a) Approximately $760 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. At December 31, 2013, third-party guarantees totaled $696 million, of which approximately 90% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2013, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities, and credit quality of our current and former venture partners. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services accounting model. 46 Table of Contents We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments contracted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 45% of our total net sales in 2013 and 2012 and 50% of our total net sales in 2011, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical, and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 50% of our total net sales in 2013 and 2012 and 45% of our total net sales in 2011, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012, and 2011, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Percentage-of-Completion Method of Accounting We record net sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. 47 Table of Contents Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance), and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our sales, segment operating profit, and segment operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and segment operating margins may also be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above; cost recoveries on all restructuring charges; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and insurance recoveries; among others. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates, or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Services Method of Accounting Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. 48 Table of Contents Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Overview Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 10). In recent years, we have taken certain actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results, including no longer offering a defined benefit pension plan to non-union represented employees hired after December 2005. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. We have also made substantial cash contributions over the years to our defined benefit pension plans including $2.25 billion in 2013, $3.6 billion in 2012, and $2.3 billion in 2011. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, rates of return on plan assets, and other actuarial assumptions including participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the future benefits to be paid to plan participants based on past service. The present value is calculated using a discount rate that is determined at the end of each year. Historically low interest rates over the last few years have significantly increased our benefit obligation. This has contributed to a lower funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as determined by GAAP but has been partially mitigated by a rise in interest rates during 2013. The funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined by the PPA. This ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. The ERISA liability does not reflect anticipated future pay increases for plan participants as required under GAAP and is currently measured using a higher discount rate than for GAAP, primarily due to The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) which provides temporary funding relief due to the historically low interest rate environment. By way of contrast, under ERISA our plans are about 90% funded at December 31, 2013 and 2012, while for GAAP our defined benefit pension plans are about 78% and 67% funded at December 31, 2013 and 2012. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations. The primary year-end assumptions used to determine the funded status and estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, employee turnover, and participant mortality estimates for all postretirement benefit plans; the expected rates of increase in future compensation levels for the 49 Table of Contents participants in our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make impact both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. When reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We determined that 4.75% was an appropriate discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2013 related to our defined benefit pension plans, compared to 4.00% at the end of 2012 and 4.75% at the end of 2011. We selected 4.50% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2013 related to our retiree medical plans, compared to 3.75% at the end of 2012 and 4.50% at the end of 2011. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. We determined that 8.00% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2013, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $9.6 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans, net of the December 31, 2013 measurement which increased equity by $2.9 billion primarily as a result of the increase in the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates from 6.375% at the end of 2007 to 4.75% at the end of 2013 and investment losses incurred during 2008, which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately 10 years. During 2013, $1.0 billion of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and $700 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2014. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.75% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2013, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2013 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.75% discount rate at December 31, 2013 that was used to compute the expected 2014 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2014 would be lower or higher by approximately $130 million. If the 8.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2013 that was used to compute the expected 2014 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2014 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Funding Considerations The PPA became applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011 and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions. We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.25 billion in 2013, $3.6 billion in 2012, and $2.3 billion in 2011, inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. Under CAS, amounts funded are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. We recovered $1.5 billion in 2013, $1.1 billion in 2012 and $899 million in 2011 as CAS costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS funding requirements are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2013, our prepayment credits were approximately $9.6 billion, inclusive of interest. Pursuant to the CAS Harmonization rules, the prepayment balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment returns on plan assets. 50 Table of Contents The CAS Board published its revised pension accounting rules (CAS Harmonization) with an effective date of February 27, 2012 to better align the recovery of pension contributions, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the PPA. The CAS Harmonization rules increased our CAS cost beginning in 2013. There is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules is phased in, with the full impact occurring in 2017. We expect the incremental impact of CAS Harmonization will increase successively over years 2014 through 2017. Based upon current assumptions which may change, we expect that the increase in 2014 CAS costs caused by CAS Harmonization should be in excess of the pension expense we record under GAAP (FAS pension expense). Accordingly, we expect our FAS/CAS pension adjustment, discussed further in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section above, will increase earnings in 2014 as mentioned below rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years. Trends Our CAS recoveries are expected to exceed our cash contributions in 2014 and for several years thereafter, as we utilize the $9.6 billion prepayment credits under the CAS rules. In 2014, we anticipate recovering $1.6 billion as CAS cost on our contracts and expect to make contributions of $1.0 billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, which would increase our cash flow from operations. We expect our required contributions to continue to be temporarily lowered in 2014 and 2015 as a result of MAP-21. We expect that our 2014 FAS pension expense will be $1.3 billion, which is less than our 2013 FAS pension expense of $1.9 billion, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate. Also, we expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2014 of about $345 million, as compared to FAS/CAS pension expense of $482 million in 2013, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate and higher CAS costs due to recoveries. We expect our 2014 earnings per share to be higher than in 2013, primarily due to our expected FAS/CAS pension income in 2014. Mortality assumptions, as published by the IRS, are used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants during which they are expected to receive benefit payments. Actuarial studies are currently being conducted that indicate life expectancies are longer and would have the resultant impact of increasing the amount of benefit payments to plan participants. The pension obligation recognized at December 31, 2013 and the amounts estimated for 2014 pension expense, CAS cost, and funding do not reflect the impact of these actuarial studies as such studies have not yet been finalized. The new mortality assumptions, which we expect to adopt at our next measurement date, currently are expected to increase the amount of our pension obligation and decrease our net earnings. We also expect to incorporate the new mortality assumptions into our annual incremental pension funding requirements pursuant to ERISA no earlier than 2016. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by a state agency. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $997 million and $950 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $863 million and $821 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 13 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments, and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing 51 Table of Contents of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). California and the U.S. EPA are each evaluating the need to regulate hexavalent chromium in drinking water, distinct from the current standards which regulate total chromium. In 2011, California’s health risk agency announced a non-enforceable public health goal for hexavalent chromium which California’s regulatory agency must consider when promulgating an enforceable drinking water standard, which it is expected to do by late 2014. The goal calls for levels significantly below levels encompassed within the current total chromium standard. In August 2013, California’s regulatory agency proposed a draft drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium closer to levels encompassed within the current standard. We expect that environmental groups will continue to seek a standard closer to the non-enforceable public health goal and we cannot predict the outcome of California’s regulatory proceedings. In addition, California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard with respect to a second contaminant, perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is also considering whether to regulate that contaminant in drinking water. With respect to either contaminant, if substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill Our goodwill balances were $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and test more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may 52 Table of Contents include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. We initially test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any assumed intangible assets that may not have any corresponding carrying amount in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The carrying amount of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels as well as goodwill. The corporate allocations include our postretirement benefit plans liabilities, as determined in accordance with CAS, in order to align the basis of the carrying amounts with the determination of the fair values of our reporting units, which are measured using CAS cost. CAS cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, affects the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for CAS is currently higher than the discount rate used for GAAP but is expected to trend downward over the next few years, which would increase the amount of CAS liabilities allocated to each reporting unit, contributing to a reduction in the carrying amount of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public trading values and values observed in market transactions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, discount rates, perpetual growth rates, and relevant comparable company earnings multiples and transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions; changes in working capital; most recent long-term business plans in place at the time of our testing date; and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of these tests indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, with the exception of our Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures on the Technical Services business, which typically has smaller customer contracts of a shorter duration, adversely impacted the fair value of this reporting unit. As a result, we compared the implied value of that reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill, and since the carrying amount exceeded the implied value, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $195 million, net of state tax benefits, in the fourth quarter of 2013 equal to that differential. The fair value of each reporting unit was based on our best estimates and judgment, particularly assumptions regarding the planned defense spending levels of the U.S. Government, our principal customer. If customer budget pressures continue, these circumstances could eventually result in other impairments of goodwill in the future. Our reporting units in our IS&GS business segment and our services businesses at our MFC and MST business segments have smaller customer contracts of short duration and are most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions. Following the goodwill impairment charge described above, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of a goodwill impairment charge in the near-term, as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying amounts. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding assumptions about expected future sales, profits, and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2013, and the outstanding principal amount was $7.0 billion, excluding unamortized discounts of $882 million. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2013. We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items, or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1.2 billion and $503 million. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (Note 15). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2013 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2013, investments in the trust totaled $1.0 billion and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our Statements of Earnings in other unallocated costs, and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2013. 54 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:40.662664
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2015,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Business Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics and information services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2014, 79% of our $45.6 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 59% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 20% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Mission Systems and Training (MST) and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash flow1 to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next three years. We expect 2015 net sales will decline in the low single digit range from 2014 levels as we continue to see downward pressure from the effects of U.S. Government budget reductions, primarily in our services businesses. We expect our 2015 segment operating profit will decline in the mid to high single digit range from 2014 levels due to an expected decrease in segment operating profit at all five business segments. Accordingly, we expect 2015 segment operating profit margin will be below the 2014 levels, in the 11.5% to 12.0% range. Our outlook for 2015 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2015 budget. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2015 net sales and operating profit margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Funding Constraints The U.S. Government, our principal customer, continues to face significant fiscal and economic challenges such as financial deficits, budget uncertainty, increasing debt levels, and an economy with restrained growth. To address these challenges, the U.S. Government continues to focus on discretionary spending, entitlement programs, taxes, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. In doing so, the Administration and Congress must balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment largely imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act). The Budget Control Act established limits on discretionary spending, which provided for reductions to planned defense spending of $487 billion over a 10 year period that began with GFY 2012 (a U.S. Government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30). The Budget Control Act also provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, which went into effect on March 1, 2013, that would have reduced planned defense spending by an additional $500 billion over a nine-year period that began in GFY 2013. In December 2013, the U.S. Government enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Bipartisan Budget Act), which increased the limits on discretionary spending for GFY 2015 among other fiscal changes. Although the Bipartisan Budget 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 25 Table of Contents Act allows for more certainty in the budget planning process for GFY 2015, it retained sequestration cuts for GFYs 2016 through 2021, including the across-the-board spending reduction methodology provided for in the Budget Control Act. As a result, there remains uncertainty regarding how sequestration cuts beyond GFY 2015 will be applied as the DoD and other agencies may have significantly less flexibility in how to apply budget cuts in future years. While the defense budget sustained the largest single reductions under the Budget Control Act, other civil agencies and programs have also been impacted by significant spending reductions. In light of the Budget Control Act and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending by the U.S. Government will remain constrained for a number of years. On December 16, 2014, the U.S. Government passed the GFY 2015 omnibus spending bill to finance most federal activities through September 30, 2015, the end of its current fiscal year, after operating under continuing resolution temporary funding measures from October 1, 2014 to December 16, 2014. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security remains funded through a continuing resolution until February 27, 2015. The omnibus spending bill provides for a revised defense spending limit of $585 billion for GFY 2015 and eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procuring products and services under the continuing resolution. Under continuing resolutions, partial-year funding is available at prior year levels, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. On February 2, 2015, the President submitted a budget proposal for GFY 2016, which included $534 billion for defense spending, about $35 billion more than the spending limits under the Budget Control Act. The budget also provides for $51 billion in additional war spending. We anticipate there will continue to be a significant debate within the U.S. Government over defense spending throughout the budget process for GFY 2016 and beyond. The outcome of these debates could have long-term consequences for our industry and company as described below. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products and services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources. Potential Impacts of Budget Reductions While recent budget actions provide a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the U.S. Government’s fiscal challenges, sequestration remains a long-term concern. If not further modified, sequestration could have significant negative impacts on our industry and company in future periods. There may be disruption of ongoing programs, impacts to our supply chain, contractual actions (including partial or complete terminations), potential facilities closures, and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry that will severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge. Sequestration, or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration, could have a material negative effect on our company. Despite the continued uncertainty surrounding U.S. Government budgets, the investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. Additionally, we are seeking to lessen our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government by focusing on expanding into adjacent markets close to our core capabilities and growing international sales but we may not be successful in this strategy. The possibility remains, however, that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S. Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, or budget reductions, including sequestration (particularly in those circumstances where sequestration is implemented across-the-board without regard to national priorities). Additionally, decreases in production volume associated with budget cuts, including sequestration, will increase unit costs making our products less affordable for both our U.S. and international customers. In particular, sequestration may also result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base. Such activity could result in claims from our suppliers, which may include the amount established in any settlement agreements, the costs of evaluating the supplier settlement proposals, and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements. Budget cuts, including sequestration, could result in restructuring charges, impairment of assets, including goodwill, or other charges. We expect costs associated with claims from our suppliers and restructuring charges will be recovered from our customers. Generally, we expect that the impact of budget reductions on our operating results will lag in certain of our businesses with longer cycles such as our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and our products businesses within our MFC and MST business segments, due to our production contract backlog. However, our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our IS&GS business segment and certain services businesses within our MFC and MST business segments. We have also experienced increased market pressures in these services businesses including lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. Additionally, our services businesses across most of our business segments have experienced lower volume due to improved product field performance that require less service support. 26 Table of Contents Other Business Considerations International Business A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on expanding our in-country presence and strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and local production joint technology offices. Since 2013, we have acquired Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company, and we have opened new in-country offices including Israel, United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia that will enable development of partnerships to create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace and security sectors. We conduct business with international customers primarily through our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments. In our Aeronautics business segment, there remains strong international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program includes commitments from eight international partner countries and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35. The international role on the program is growing as we installed the Autonomic Logistics Information System Central Point of Entry kit at the final assembly and checkout facility in Italy. We also delivered the first two Australian F-35 aircraft in 2014. The number of F-35 aircraft for international customers in recent low-rate initial production (LRIP) contracts continues to increase, with the recent LRIP 8 contract including aircraft orders for Israel and Japan. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. The award from Iraq in 2013 for 18 additional F-16 aircraft extends production into 2017. Also, we delivered 11 C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to various international customers in 2014. Our MFC business segment produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air and missile defense systems, which continue to generate significant international interest. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. During 2014, we received an award to provide PAC-3 missile defense equipment to Qatar. Other international customers include Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Kuwait and the UAE. Other countries in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products. In our MST business segment, we continue to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, ship integration and test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea and Australia. We have an ongoing program in Canada for combat systems equipment upgrades on 13 Halifax-class frigates. In our Training and Logistics Solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Qatar, and Australia. Also, we integrate mission avionics on the MH-60 program for Australia and Denmark. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of a development contract and multiple production contracts, including sustainment activities. The development contract is being performed concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the development portion of the F-35 program will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government continues to complete various operational tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations, and weapons testing, with the F-35 aircraft fleet recently surpassing 25,000 flight hours. In November 2014, the U.S. Government successfully completed testing of the carrier variant at sea aboard the USS Nimitz. Progress continues to be made on the production of aircraft. As of December 31, 2014, we have delivered 109 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners including delivery of the final LRIP contract 5 aircraft, and have 100 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners. 27 Table of Contents Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the aircraft. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities. Internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments. Acquisitions In 2014, we paid $898 million for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisitions of Systems Made Simple, Zeta Associates, Inc. (Zeta) and Industrial Defender, Inc. (Industrial Defender). Systems Made Simple provides solutions that leverage information technology in the healthcare domain to improve, increase, enable and ensure the exchange and interoperability of information between patients, providers and payers and has been included in our IS&GS business segment. Zeta designs systems that enable collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of information for intelligence and defense communities and has been included in our Space Systems business segment. Industrial Defender is a provider of cyber security solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries and has been included in our IS&GS business segment. In 2013, we paid $269 million for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisition of Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company specializing in information technology, civil government services and the energy market. This acquisition is aligned with our strategy to grow international sales and has been included in our IS&GS business segment. In 2012, we paid $259 million for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisitions of Chandler/May, Inc. (Chandler/May), CDL Systems Ltd. (CDL) and Procerus Technologies, L.C. (Procerus). These companies specialize in the design, development, manufacturing, control and support of advanced unmanned systems, which expand our offerings in support of our customers’ increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our strategy to maintain a portfolio of advanced technology options. These companies are part of our MST business segment where they have been integrated into our portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies to align their product and service offerings to the U.S. Army. For additional information, see “Note 13 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 45,600 $ 45,358 $ 47,182 Cost of sales (40,345 ) (41,171 ) (42,986) Gross profit 5,255 4,187 4,196 Other income, net 337 318 238 Operating profit 5,592 4,505 4,434 Interest expense (340 ) (350 ) (383) Other non-operating income, net 6 — 21 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 5,258 4,155 4,072 Income tax expense (1,644 ) (1,205 ) (1,327) Net earnings from continuing operations 3,614 2,950 2,745 Net earnings from discontinued operations — 31 — Net earnings $ 3,614 $ 2,981 $ 2,745 Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $ 11.21 $ 9.04 $ 8.36 Discontinued operations — .09 — Total diluted earnings per common share $ 11.21 $ 9.13 $ 8.36 Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations. Net Sales We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Product sales are predominantly generated in our Aeronautics, MFC, MST and Space Systems business segments and most of our service sales are generated in our IS&GS and MFC business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Products $ 36,093 $ 35,691 $ 37,817 Services 9,507 9,667 9,365 Total net sales $ 45,600 $ 45,358 $ 47,182 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method. Product Sales Our product sales represent about 80% of our total sales for both 2014 and 2013. Product sales increased $402 million, or 1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Higher product sales of about $815 million at Aeronautics and approximately $280 million at MFC were partially offset by lower product sales of about $570 million at IS&GS and approximately $125 million at Space Systems. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was attributable to higher volume on F-35 production contracts 29 Table of Contents and sustainment activities, increased aircraft deliveries (F-16 program) and increased risk retirements (F-22 program). Product sales at MFC increased as a result of increased volume on air and missile defense systems programs (primarily THAAD), and increased deliveries on fire control programs (including the Apache Fire Control System (Apache)). Lower product sales at IS&GS were primarily due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs, driven by reductions in direct warfighter support and defense budgets tied to command and control programs. The decline at Space Systems was due to lower volume for government satellite programs (primarily Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Global Positioning System III (GPS-III), and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)), partially offset by the Orion program due to increased volume (primarily the first unmanned test flight of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV)). Our product sales represent about 80% of our total sales for both 2013 and 2012. Product sales decreased $2.1 billion, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower volume and deliveries. Product sales decreased about $915 million at Aeronautics primarily due to fewer aircraft deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-130) and lower volume and risk retirements on F-22 due to completion of aircraft deliveries in 2012, partially offset by increased volume and risk retirements on F-35 production contracts and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-5 program; about $750 million at IS&GS for various programs due to lower volume (such as Next Generation Identification (NGI) and En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) programs); about $440 million at MST due to fewer deliveries (primarily PTDS as final surveillance system deliveries occurred during the second quarter of 2012) and lower volume (primarily integrated warfare systems and sensors programs); and about $405 million at Space Systems due to lower volume (primarily commercial satellites and the Orion program) partially offset by increased volume (primarily various government satellite programs). The decreases were partially offset by higher product sales of about $380 million at MFC due to increased volume and risk retirements (primarily THAAD and deliveries of PAC-3). Service Sales Our service sales represent about 20% of our total sales for 2014 and 2013. Service sales decreased $160 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were primarily due to lower service sales at MFC of about $355 million due to various technical services programs as a result of decreased volume reflecting market pressures, and lower service sales at Aeronautics of about $20 million attributable to decreased sustainment activities. These decreases were partially offset by higher service sales at Space Systems of about $230 million primarily for commercial space transportation programs due to launch-related activities. Our service sales represent about 20% of our total sales for 2013 and 2012. Service sales increased $302 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Service sales increased about $270 million at IS&GS primarily due to the start-up of certain programs (such as the Defense Information Systems Agency – Global Information Grid Services Management-Operations (DISA GSM-O) and the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support); and about $85 million at Aeronautics primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily F-16). The increases were partially offset by lower service sales of about $80 million at MFC for various technical services programs due to lower volume, partially offset by various fire control programs (primarily Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS)) due to higher volume. Service sales for 2013 were comparable to 2012 at both MST and Space Systems. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Cost of sales – products $ (31,965 ) $ (31,346 ) $ (33,495) % of product sales 88.6 % 87.8 % 88.6% Cost of sales – services (8,393 ) (8,588 ) (8,383) % of service sales 88.3 % 88.8 % 89.5% Goodwill impairment charges (119 ) (195 ) — Severance charges — (201 ) (48) Other unallocated, net 132 (841 ) (1,060) Total cost of sales $ (40,345 ) $ (41,171 ) $ (42,986) 30 Table of Contents Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product Costs Product costs increased $619 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Product costs increased about $815 million at Aeronautics, approximately $320 million at MFC and about $85 million at MST. Increases in product costs at Aeronautics and MFC were primarily due to the reasons for higher product sales at each respective business segment described above, and net warranty reserve adjustments recorded in 2014 at MFC (including Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), and Guided Multiple Launcher Rocker Systems (GMLRS)). The increase at MST was primarily due to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in the prior year (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program) that were not repeated in 2014 and higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs during 2014. These increases in product costs were partially offset by decreases of about $475 million at IS&GS and $130 million at Space Systems, primarily due to the reasons for lower product sales at each respective business segment described above. The 0.8% increase in product costs as a percentage of product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the items increasing product costs at MFC and MST mentioned above, and decreased risk retirements at Aeronautics (primarily F-16). Product costs decreased $2.1 billion, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower volume and deliveries. Product costs decreased about $770 million at Aeronautics due to fewer aircraft deliveries (primarily F-16 and C-130) and lower volume (primarily F-22), partially offset by increased volume for F-35 production contracts, increased aircraft deliveries and the impact of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 for the C-5 program and lower risk retirements on various programs (primarily C-130); about $685 million at IS&GS for various programs primarily due to decreased volume; about $570 million at MST primarily due to fewer deliveries and net increased risk retirements for the PTDS program and various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs and for the favorable resolution of certain contract cost matters (including the terminated presidential helicopter program); and about $315 million at Space Systems due to lower volume (primarily commercial satellites and the Orion program). The decreases were partially offset by higher product costs of about $190 million at MFC due to increased volume (primarily THAAD and deliveries of PAC-3), partially offset by various other programs due increased risk retirements (primarily fire control programs). The 0.8% decrease in product costs as a percentage of product sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher risk retirements (primarily at MFC and MST) and the favorable resolution of contractual matters at MST. Service Costs Service costs decreased $195 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Lower service costs of about $325 million at MFC and approximately $40 million at Aeronautics were partially offset by an increase in service costs of approximately $225 million at Space Systems. The decrease at MFC was attributable to lower volume for various technical services programs. The decline at Aeronautics was mostly attributable to decreased sustainment activities. The increase at Space Systems was primarily attributable to commercial space transportation programs due to launch-related activities. The 0.5% decrease in service costs as a percentage of service sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to items decreasing service costs at MFC. Service costs increased $205 million, or 2%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Most of our service costs are in the IS&GS and MFC business segments. The increase in service costs was primarily attributable to higher service costs at our IS&GS and Aeronautics business segments partially offset by lower service costs at our MFC business segment. Service costs increased about $245 million at IS&GS primarily due to the start-up of various programs. Service costs increased about $40 million at Aeronautics primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily F-16). Service costs decreased about $75 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume of various technical services programs, partially offset by higher volume from various fire control programs (primarily SOF CLSS). The 0.7% decrease in service costs as a percentage of service sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts at Aeronautics. Goodwill Impairment Charges In the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $119 million and $195 million, which reduced our net earnings by $107 million ($.33 per share) and $176 million ($.54 per share). For additional information, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Goodwill” section below and “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges 2013 Actions During 2013, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $201 million of which $83 million, $37 million and $81 million related to our IS&GS, MST and Space Systems business segments. These charges reduced our net earnings by $130 million ($.40 per share) and primarily related to a plan we committed to in November 2013 to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce our total workforce by approximately 4,000 positions within our IS&GS, MST and Space Systems business segments. These charges also include $30 million related to certain severance actions at our IS&GS business segment that occurred in the first quarter of 2013, which were subsequently paid in 2013. The November 2013 plan resulted from a strategic review of facility capacity and future workload projections for these businesses and is intended to better align our organization and cost structure and improve the affordability of our products and services given the changes in U.S. Government spending as well as the rapidly changing competitive and economic landscape. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. As of December 31, 2014, we have paid approximately $107 million in severance payments associated with this action, of which approximately $92 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining severance payments are expected to be paid through the middle of 2015. We also expect to incur total accelerated costs (e.g., accelerated depreciation expense related to long-lived assets at the sites to be closed) and incremental costs (e.g., relocation of equipment and other employee related costs) of approximately $15 million, $50 million and $175 million at our IS&GS, MST and Space Systems business segments through the completion of this plan in 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we have incurred total accelerated and incremental costs of approximately $110 million, most of which was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. The accelerated and incremental costs are recorded as incurred in cost of sales on our Statements of Earnings and included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. Of the total accelerated and incremental costs to be incurred mentioned above, we have recovered approximately $50 million in 2014 and expect to recover approximately $50 million in 2015. Also, we expect the restructuring charges will reduce our 2015 cash flow from operations by approximately $170 million, mostly due to expected incremental costs in 2015. 2012 Actions During 2012, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $48 million of which $25 million related to our Aeronautics business segment and $23 million related to the reorganization of our former Electronic Systems business segment. These charges reduced our net earnings by $31 million ($.09 per share) and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. These severance actions resulted from cost reduction initiatives to better align our organization with changing economic conditions. Upon separation, terminated employees received lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, all of which were paid in 2013. Other Unallocated, Net Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the Business Segment Results of Operations section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was $132 million of income for 2014, compared to $841 million and $1.1 billion of expense in 2013 and 2012. The fluctuation between each respective period was primarily attributable to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income of $376 million for 2014 compared to expense of $482 million and $830 million for 2013 and 2012, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The changes in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment between the periods were attributable to various items impacting the calculations of financial accounting standards (FAS) pension expense and U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost. FAS pension expense in 2014 was less than 2013 and 2012 due to higher discount rates used to calculate our qualified defined benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, beginning in the quarter ended September 28, 2014, FAS pension expense was reduced by the June 2014 plan amendments to certain of our defined benefit pension plans to freeze future retirement benefits, partially offset by the impact of using new longevity (also known 32 Table of Contents as mortality) assumptions (Note 9). The higher CAS pension cost in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization, partially offset by the effect of higher interest rates required by the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA), which was enacted on August 8, 2014. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” for a discussion of HATFA and CAS Harmonization and the impact on our CAS pension cost. Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees. Other income, net for 2014 was $337 million, compared to $318 million in 2013 and $238 million in 2012. The changes between years primarily were due to fluctuations in earnings from equity method investees in our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2014 was $340 million, compared to $350 million in 2013 and $383 million in 2012. The decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt from the debt exchange that occurred in December 2012. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net in 2014 was comparable to 2013. Other non-operating income, net decreased $21 million from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2012. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 31.3% for 2014, 29.0% for 2013 and 32.6% for 2012. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development (R&D) tax credit, which were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of the non-cash goodwill impairment charges in 2014 and 2013. The U.S. manufacturing deduction benefit for 2014 and 2013 reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points as compared to 2012. The decrease between years occurred because our tax-deductible discretionary pension contributions of $2.5 billion in 2012, which reduced U.S. manufacturing deduction benefits by $59 million ($.18 per share), were significantly higher than in 2014 and 2013. In 2014, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for one year, retroactive to the beginning of 2014, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.9 percentage point. In 2013, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for two years, retroactive to the beginning of 2012. As a result, the effective income tax rate for 2013 reflects the credit for all of 2013 and 2012, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points. Since the R&D tax credit again expired on December 31, 2014, this benefit will not be incorporated into the Corporation’s 2015 outlook or results unless and until legislation is enacted. A limited amount of the non-cash goodwill impairment charges will be deductible for tax purposes. Accordingly, the non-cash goodwill impairment charges increased our effective income tax rates by 0.6 percentage point for 2014 and 1.2 percentage points for 2013 (Note 1). Future changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable and our deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $5.5 billion and $3.9 billion, based on a 35% Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If legislation reducing the Federal statutory income tax rate to 25% had been enacted at December 31, 2014, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $1.6 billion and we would have recorded a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $1.6 billion. This additional expense would be less if the legislation phased in the tax rate reduction or if the final rate was higher than 25%. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. 33 Table of Contents Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion ($11.21 per share) in 2014, $3.0 billion ($9.04 per share) in 2013 and $2.7 billion ($8.36 per share) in 2012. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately five million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 as a result of share repurchases, which were partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2013 include a benefit of $31 million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to a business sold prior to 2013. Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, IS&GS, MFC, MST and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is part of our Space Systems business segment, is our primary equity method investee. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (Note 1) and significant severance actions (Note 14); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 13); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2014, we have FAS/CAS pension income and, conversely, to the extent FAS pension expense exceeds CAS pension cost, which occurred for 2013 and 2012, we have FAS/CAS pension expense. 34 Table of Contents The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (Note 13) for all years presented. Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales Aeronautics $ 14,920 $ 14,123 $ 14,953 Information Systems & Global Solutions 7,788 8,367 8,846 Missiles and Fire Control 7,680 7,757 7,457 Mission Systems and Training 7,147 7,153 7,579 Space Systems 8,065 7,958 8,347 Total net sales $ 45,600 $ 45,358 $ 47,182 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,649 $ 1,612 $ 1,699 Information Systems & Global Solutions 699 759 808 Missiles and Fire Control 1,358 1,431 1,256 Mission Systems and Training 843 905 737 Space Systems 1,039 1,045 1,083 Total business segment operating profit 5,588 5,752 5,583 Unallocated items FAS/CAS pension adjustment FAS pension expense (a) (1,144 ) (1,948 ) (1,941) Less: CAS pension cost (b) 1,520 1,466 1,111 FAS/CAS pension income (expense) (c) 376 (482 ) (830) Goodwill impairment charges (d) (119 ) (195 ) — Severance charges (e) — (201 ) (48) Stock-based compensation (164 ) (189 ) (167) Other, net (89 ) (180 ) (104) Total unallocated items 4 (1,247 ) (1,149) Total consolidated operating profit $ 5,592 $ 4,505 $ 4,434 (a) FAS pension expense in 2014 was less than in 2013 due to higher discount rates used to calculate our qualified defined benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, beginning in the quarter ended September 28, 2014, FAS pension expense was reduced by the June 2014 plan amendments to certain of our defined benefit pension plans to freeze future retirement benefits, partially offset by the impact of using new longevity assumptions (Note 9). (b) The higher CAS pension cost reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization, partially offset by the effect of higher interest rates required by the HATFA, enacted on August 8, 2014. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” for a discussion of HATFA and CAS Harmonization and the impact on our CAS pension cost. (c) We expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2015 of about $475 million as further discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” section below. (d) We recognized non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment in 2014 and 2013. For more information, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. (e) See “Note 14 – Restructuring Charges” of our consolidated financial statements for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments and Corporate Headquarters. Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $80.5 billion, $82.6 billion and $82.3 billion at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $56.5 billion at December 31, 2014. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. 35 Table of Contents We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges and insurance recoveries. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; certain asset impairments; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; and reserves for disputes. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion for 36 Table of Contents 2014, 2013 and 2012. The decrease in our consolidated net adjustments for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our MST and MFC business segments and, to a lesser extent, the increase in the favorable resolution of contractual matters for the corporation. The consolidated net adjustments for 2014 are inclusive of approximately $650 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs at MST and net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including JASSM and GMLRS) at MFC as described in the respective business segment’s results of operations below. The consolidated net adjustments for 2013 and 2012 are inclusive of approximately $600 million and $500 million in unfavorable items, which include a significant profit reduction on the F-35 development contract in both years, as well as a significant profit reduction on the C-5 program in 2013, each as described in our Aeronautics business segment’s results of operations discussion below. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 14,920 $ 14,123 $ 14,953 Operating profit 1,649 1,612 1,699 Operating margins 11.1 % 11.4 % 11.4% Backlog at year-end $ 27,600 $ 28,000 $ 30,100 2014 compared to 2013 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2014 increased $797 million, or 6%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $790 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume and sustainment activities; about $55 million for the F-16 program due to increased deliveries (17 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 13 delivered in 2013) partially offset by contract mix; and approximately $45 million for the F-22 program due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the F-35 development contract due to decreased volume, partially offset by the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013; and about $40 million for the C-130 program due to fewer deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 25 delivered in 2013) and decreased sustainment activities, partially offset by contract mix. Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2014 increased $37 million, or 2%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $85 million for the F-35 development contract due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013; about $75 million for the F-22 program due to increased risk retirements; approximately $50 million for the C-130 program due to increased risk retirements and contract mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries; and about $25 million for the C-5 program due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $130 million for the F-16 program due to decreased risk retirements, partially offset by increased deliveries; and about $70 million for sustainment activities due to decreased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit was comparable for F-35 production contracts as higher volume was offset by lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $105 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 2013 compared to 2012 Aeronautics’ net sales for 2013 decreased $830 million, or 6%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $530 million for the F-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (13 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 37 delivered in 2012) partially offset by aircraft configuration mix; about $385 million for the C-130 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (25 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 34 in 2012) partially offset by increased sustainment activities; approximately $255 million for the F-22 program, which includes about $205 million due to 37 Table of Contents decreased production volume as final aircraft deliveries were completed during the second quarter of 2012 and $50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter during the second quarter of 2012; and about $270 million for various other programs (primarily sustainment activities) due to decreased volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $295 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements; approximately $245 million for the C-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries (six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012) and other modernization activities; and about $70 million for the F-35 development contract due to increased volume. Aeronautics’ operating profit for 2013 decreased $87 million, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $85 million for the F-22 program, which includes approximately $50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume; approximately $70 million for the C-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities; about $65 million for the C-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements; approximately $35 million for the F-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix. The decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $180 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit was comparable for the F-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $75 million lower for 2013 compared to 2012. Backlog Backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on F-16 and F-22 programs. Backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on F-16, C-5 and C-130 programs, partially offset by higher orders on the F-35 program. Trends We expect Aeronautics’ 2015 net sales to be comparable or slightly behind 2014 due to a decline in F-16 deliveries as well as a decline in F-35 development activity, partially offset by an increase in production contracts. Operating profit is also expected to decrease in the low single digit range, due primarily to contract mix, resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between years. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise, integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence and other government customers. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies’ information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. IS&GS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 7,788 $ 8,367 $ 8,846 Operating profit 699 759 808 Operating margins 9.0 % 9.1 % 9.1% Backlog at year-end $ 8,700 $ 8,300 $ 8,700 2014 compared to 2013 IS&GS’ net sales decreased $579 million, or 7%, for 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of about $645 million for 2014 due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs, driven by reductions in direct warfighter support (including JIEDDO and PTDS) and defense budgets tied to command and control programs; and approximately $490 million for 2014 due to a decline in volume for various ongoing programs, which reflects lower funding levels and programs impacted by in-theater force reductions. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $550 million for 2014 due to the start-up of new programs, growth in recently awarded programs and integration of recently acquired companies. 38 Table of Contents IS&GS’ operating profit decreased $60 million, or 8%, for 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to the activities mentioned above for sales, lower risk retirements and reserves recorded on an international program, partially offset by severance recoveries related to the restructuring announced in November 2013 of approximately $20 million for 2014. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $30 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 2013 compared to 2012 IS&GS’ net sales decreased $479 million, or 5%, for 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of about $495 million due to decreased volume on various programs (command and control programs for classified customers, NGI and ERAM programs); and approximately $320 million due to the completion of certain programs (such as Total Information Processing Support Services, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential and the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA). The decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of about $340 million due to the start-up of certain programs (such as the DISA GSM-O and the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support). IS&GS’ operating profit decreased $49 million, or 6%, for 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $55 million due to certain programs nearing the end of their life cycles, partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $15 million due to the start-up of certain programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were comparable for 2013 compared to 2012. Backlog Backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to several multi-year international awards and various U.S. multi-year extensions. This increase was partially offset by declining activities on various direct warfighter support and command and control programs impacted by defense budget reductions. Backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower orders on several programs (such as ERAM and NGI), higher sales on certain programs (the National Science Foundation Antarctic Support and the DISA GSM-O) and declining activities on several smaller programs primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets. Trends We expect IS&GS’ net sales to decline in 2015 in the low to mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets, an increasingly competitive environment, including the disaggregation of existing contracts, and new contract award delays, partially offset by increased sales resulting from acquisitions that occurred during the year. Operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in 2015 primarily driven by volume and an increase in intangible amortization from 2014 acquisition activity, resulting in 2015 margins that are lower than 2014 results. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics and other technical services; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, Sniper®, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 7,680 $ 7,757 $ 7,457 Operating profit 1,358 1,431 1,256 Operating margins 17.7 % 18.4 % 16.8% Backlog at year-end $ 13,600 $ 15,000 $ 14,700 2014 compared to 2013 MFC’s net sales for 2014 decreased $77 million, or 1%, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $385 million for technical services programs due to decreased volume reflecting market pressures; and about $115 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily High Mobility Artillery 39 Table of Contents Rocket System and Army Tactical Missile System). The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $180 million for air and missile defense programs primarily due to increased volume for THAAD; about $115 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (including Apache); and about $125 million for various other programs due to increased volume. MFC’s operating profit for 2014 decreased $73 million, or 5%, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $45 million for technical services programs due to decreased volume and reserves recorded on certain programs; about $20 million for tactical missile programs due to net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including JASSM and GMLRS) and fewer deliveries; and approximately $45 million for various other programs due to lower risk retirements. The decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $20 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD and PAC-3); and about $15 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Apache), partially offset by lower risk retirements (primarily Sniper®). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 2013 compared to 2012 MFC’s net sales for 2013 increased $300 million, or 4%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $450 million for air and missile defense programs (THAAD and PAC-3) due to increased production volume and deliveries; about $70 million for fire control programs due to net increased deliveries and volume; and approximately $55 million for tactical missile programs due to net increased deliveries. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $275 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume driven by the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures. The increase for fire control programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on the Sniper® and LANTIRN® programs, increased volume on the SOF CLSS program, partially offset by lower volume on Longbow Fire Control Radar and other programs. The increase for tactical missile programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on JASSM and other programs, partially offset by fewer deliveries on GMLRS and Javelin programs. MFC’s operating profit for 2013 increased $175 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $85 million for air and missile defense programs (THAAD and PAC-3) due to increased risk retirements and volume; about $85 million for fire control programs (Sniper®, LANTIRN® and Apache) due to increased risk retirements and higher volume; and approximately $75 million for tactical missile programs (Hellfire and various programs) due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of about $45 million for the resolution of contractual matters in the second quarter of 2012; and approximately $15 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume partially offset by increased risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million higher for 2013 compared to 2012. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on THAAD, fire control systems programs and technical services programs, partially offset by higher orders on certain tactical missile programs and PAC-3. Backlog increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders on the THAAD program and lower sales volume compared to new orders on certain fire control systems programs in 2013, partially offset by lower orders on technical services programs and certain tactical missile programs. Trends We expect MFC’s net sales to decline in the mid single digit percentage range in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a decline in the services business as a result of the increased competitive environment and a slight decline in our Air and Missile Defense business, specifically THAAD and PAC-3 volume. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single digit percentage range, driven by reduced volume and fewer risk retirements in 2015 compared to 2014. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2014 levels. 40 Table of Contents Mission Systems and Training Our MST business segment provides ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. MST’s major programs include Aegis Combat System (Aegis), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), MH-60, TPQ-53 Radar System and MK-41 Vertical Launching System. MST’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 7,147 $ 7,153 $ 7,579 Operating profit 843 905 737 Operating margins 11.8 % 12.7 % 9.7 % Backlog at year-end $ 11,700 $ 10,800 $ 10,700 2014 compared to 2013 MST’s net sales for 2014 were comparable to 2013. Net sales decreased by approximately $85 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume and deliveries; and about $55 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program) in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014. The decreases were offset by higher net sales of approximately $80 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to increased volume (primarily Space Fence); and approximately $40 million for training and logistics solutions programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Close Combat Tactical Trainer). MST’s operating profit for 2014 decreased $62 million, or 7%, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program) in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014; and approximately $45 million due to higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs. The decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $45 million for performance matters and reserves recorded in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014; and about $60 million for various programs due to increased risk retirements (including MH-60 and radar surveillance programs). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $50 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 2013 compared to 2012 MST’s net sales for 2013 decreased $426 million, or 6%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $275 million for various ship and aviation systems programs due to lower volume (primarily PTDS as final surveillance system deliveries occurred during the second quarter of 2012); about $195 million for various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Naval systems) due to lower volume; approximately $65 million for various training and logistics programs due to lower volume; and about $55 million for the Aegis program due to lower volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $155 million for the LCS program due to increased volume. MST’s operating profit for 2013 increased $168 million, or 23%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlement of contract cost matters on certain programs (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program); about $55 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily radar and Halifax class modernization programs) due to increased risk retirements; and approximately $30 million for undersea systems programs due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of about $55 million for training and logistics programs, primarily due to the recording of approximately $30 million of charges mostly related to lower-of-cost-or-market considerations; and about $25 million for ship and aviation systems programs (primarily PTDS) due to lower risk retirements and volume. Operating profit related to the LCS program was comparable. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $170 million higher for 2013 compared to 2012. Backlog Backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher orders on new program starts (such as Space Fence). Backlog increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders and lower sales on integrated warfare system and sensors programs (primarily Aegis) and lower sales on various service programs, partially offset by lower orders on ship and aviation systems (primarily MH-60). 41 Table of Contents Trends We expect MST’s 2015 net sales to be comparable to 2014 net sales, with the increased volume from new program starts, specifically Space Fence and the Combat Rescue and Presidential Helicopter programs, offset by a decline in volume due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs. Operating profit is expected to decline in the mid single digit percentage range from 2014 levels, driven by a reduction in expected risk retirements in 2015. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to slightly decline from 2014 levels. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), AEHF, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), MUOS, Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) and Orion. Operating profit for our Space Systems business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Net sales $ 8,065 $ 7,958 $ 8,347 Operating profit 1,039 1,045 1,083 Operating margins 12.9 % 13.1 % 13.0 % Backlog at year-end $ 18,900 $ 20,500 $ 18,100 2014 compared to 2013 Space Systems’ net sales for 2014 increased $107 million, or 1%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $340 million for the Orion program due to increased volume (primarily the first unmanned test flight of the Orion MPCV); and about $145 million for commercial space transportation programs due to launch-related activities. The increases were offset by lower net sales of approximately $335 million for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily AEHF, GPS-III and MUOS); and about $45 million for various other programs due to decreased volume. Space Systems’ operating profit for 2014 was comparable to 2013. Operating profit decreased by approximately $20 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume (primarily AEHF and GPS-III), partially offset by increased risk retirements (primarily MUOS); and about $20 million due to decreased equity earnings for joint ventures. The decreases were offset by higher operating profit of approximately $30 million for the Orion program due to increased volume. Operating profit was reduced by approximately $40 million for charges, net of recoveries, related to the restructuring action announced in November 2013. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $10 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 2013 compared to 2012 Space Systems’ net sales for 2013 decreased $389 million, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $305 million for commercial satellite programs due to fewer deliveries (zero delivered during 2013 compared to two for 2012); and about $290 million for the Orion program due to lower volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $130 million for government satellite programs due to net increased volume; and about $65 million for strategic and defensive missile programs (primarily FBM) due to increased volume and risk retirements. The increase for government satellite programs was primarily attributable to higher volume on AEHF and other programs, partially offset by lower volume on GOES-R, MUOS and SBIRS programs. Space Systems’ operating profit for 2013 decreased $38 million, or 4%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $50 million for the Orion program due to lower volume and risk retirements and about $30 million for government satellite programs due to decreased risk retirements, which were partially offset by higher equity earnings from joint ventures of approximately $35 million. The decrease in operating profit for government satellite programs was primarily attributable to lower risk retirements for MUOS, GPS III and other programs, partially offset by higher risk retirements for the SBIRS and AEHF programs. Operating profit for 2013 included about $15 million of charges, net of recoveries, related to the November 2013 restructuring plan. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $15 million lower for 2013 compared to 2012. 42 Table of Contents Equity earnings Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems (primarily ULA in 2014 and 2013) represented approximately $280 million and $300 million, or 27% and 29% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2014 and 2013. During 2012, total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems from ULA, United Space Alliance and the U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment joint venture represented approximately $265 million, or 24%, of this business segment’s operating profit. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders and higher sales on the Orion program, partially offset by higher orders on SBIRS. Backlog increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to higher orders on the Orion program, partially offset by lower orders on government satellite programs (primarily AEHF). Trends We expect Space Systems’ net sales to decline in the mid single digit percentage range in 2015 as compared to 2014; primarily due to lower delivery based sales in 2015. Operating profit is expected to decline in the low-double digit percentage range, primarily driven by lower equity earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. As a result, operating profit margin is expected to decline between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2014. First, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 13% to $1.50 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. Further, based on our current cash projections, in October 2014 we announced a new cash deployment initiative in which we plan to reduce our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares over the next three years, market conditions and our fiduciary obligations permitting. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. As mentioned in the “Capital Resources” section below, we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, should they occur. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2014, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based 43 Table of Contents payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2014 and those planned for 2015 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities, inclusive of our efforts to consolidate and reduce leased facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 2,617 $ 1,898 $ 3,582 Operating activities Net earnings 3,614 2,981 2,745 Non-cash adjustments 876 1,570 2,133 Changes in working capital (372 ) (98 ) (1,061) Other, net (252 ) 93 (2,256) Net cash provided by operating activities 3,866 4,546 1,561 Net cash used for investing activities (1,723 ) (1,121 ) (1,177) Net cash used for financing activities (3,314 ) (2,706 ) (2,068) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,171 ) 719 (1,684) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,446 $ 2,617 $ 1,898 Operating Activities 2014 compared to 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $680 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher tax payments, net of refunds received and increases in working capital. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were approximately $760 million higher in 2014 due to an increase in net income and lower refunds received in 2014 (attributable to timing of discretionary pension contributions made during the fourth quarter of 2012). The decrease of $274 million in cash provided by working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was primarily attributed to lower cash receipts related to accounts receivable, primarily timing on the F-35 production contracts (including amounts received in 2013 from resolving U.S. Government contractual withholds that were not repeated in 2014). Partially offsetting the decreases in operating cash flows were lower pension contributions in 2014. We made $2.0 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2014, compared to $2.25 billion in 2013. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under the caption “Funding Considerations”) for discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding. 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.0 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to lower pension contributions, a lower increase in working capital, a tax refund in 2013 as discussed below and improved operating results. We made $2.25 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during 2013, compared to $3.6 billion during 2012. The $1.0 billion decline in the growth of working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to higher cash receipts related to accounts receivable, primarily on F-35 production contracts (including amounts from resolving U.S. Government contractual withholds). Partially offsetting the improved accounts receivable collections were higher payments to suppliers, primarily on F-35 production contracts. In addition, there was lower growth in inventories in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to the timing of advance payments applied to inventory. We made tax payments, net of refunds received, of $787 million during 2013, compared to $890 million during 2012. 44 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities increased $602 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased acquisition activities in 2014. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $898 million in 2014 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Zeta, Systems Made Simple, and Industrial Defender (Note 13). In 2013, we paid $269 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of Amor Group (Note 13). In 2012, we paid $259 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Chandler/May, CDL and Procerus (Note 13). Capital expenditures amounted to $845 million in 2014, $836 million in 2013 and $942 million in 2012. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities increased $608 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2014, higher dividends paid and increased repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term notes in 2013. We paid dividends totaling $1.8 billion ($5.49 per share) in 2014, $1.5 billion ($4.78 per share) in 2013 and $1.4 billion ($4.15 per share) in 2012. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. We declared quarterly dividends of $1.33 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2014 and $1.50 per share for the last quarter; $1.15 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2013 and $1.33 per share for the last quarter; and $1.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2012 and $1.15 per share for the last quarter. We paid $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion to repurchase 11.5 million, 16.2 million and 11.1 million shares of our common stock during 2014, 2013 and 2012. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $308 million, $827 million and $440 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 3.7 million shares, 10.0 million shares and 6.7 million shares of our common stock. In 2013, we repaid $150 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.38% due to their scheduled maturities. In 2012, we paid $225 million to complete an exchange of debt due to the low interest rate environment. Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2014, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $500 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash had been repatriated at the end of 2014, we estimate that about $55 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits. Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $6.2 billion and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. In August 2014, we entered into a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and concurrently terminated our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in August 2016. The new credit facility expires in August 2019. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the new credit facility up to an additional $500 million. The credit facility also includes a sublimit of up to $300 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. There were no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility through December 31, 2014. Borrowings under the new credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the new credit facility. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the new credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the new credit facility. The leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders’ equity related to postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility, as well as in our debt agreements. 45 Table of Contents We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Our stockholders’ equity was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $1.5 billion from December 31, 2013. The decrease was due to the re-measurements of our postretirement benefit plans of $2.9 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the amortization of $706 million in 2014 postretirement benefit plan expense; the repurchase of 11.5 million common shares for $1.9 billion; and dividends declared of $1.8 billion during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $3.6 billion and employee stock activity of $799 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation). As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2014, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 7,028 $ — $ 952 $ 900 $ 5,176 Interest payments 5,529 347 632 603 3,947 Other liabilities 2,811 307 468 364 1,672 Operating lease obligations 856 228 314 164 150 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 33,424 15,173 12,514 5,136 601 Capital expenditures 248 172 74 1 1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 49,896 $ 16,227 $ 14,954 $ 7,168 $ 11,547 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2014. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $32.0 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. 46 Table of Contents Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. The costs to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The ability to recover investments that we make are generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2014, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $13.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments, some of which extend through 2027. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2014 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have each received distributions from ULA, including distributions of $527 million that we and Boeing have each received (since ULA’s formation in December 2006) which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing and ULA, whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make required payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. Based on current expectations of ULA’s cash flow needs, we currently believe that ULA should have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity, including access to its $560 million revolving credit agreement from third-party financial institutions, to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2014, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2014, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $1,265 $ 941 $144 $120 $ 60 Surety bonds 348 348 — — — Guarantees 774 22 111 127 514 Total commitments $2,387 $1,311 $255 $247 $574 (a) Approximately $710 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. 47 Table of Contents At December 31, 2014, third-party guarantees totaled $774 million, of which approximately 85% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2014, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under a services accounting model. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments contracted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 40% of our total net sales in 2014 and 45% of our total net sales in 2013 and 2012, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 55% of our total net sales in 2014 and 50% of our total net sales in 2013 and 2012, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. 48 Table of Contents Percentage-of-Completion Method of Accounting We record net sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges and insurance recoveries. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; certain asset impairments; 49 Table of Contents restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; and reserves for disputes. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Services Method of Accounting Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Overview Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 9). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits. The freeze will take effect in two stages. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will be frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 will not be used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan. As a result of these plan amendments, we were required to re-measure the assets and benefit obligations for the affected defined benefit pension plans in June 2014. We also elected to re-measure the assets and benefit obligations of substantially 50 Table of Contents all other defined benefit pension plans in June 2014 to align the measurement date across substantially all of our defined benefit pension plans. As a result of the re-measurements, in June 2014 we recorded a net increase of $1.1 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension obligations and a net increase of $79 million to our nonqualified defined benefit pension obligations, which combined resulted in a corresponding increase of $735 million to other comprehensive loss during 2014, net of $402 million of tax benefits. Additionally, in recent years, we have taken other actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results, including no longer offering a defined benefit pension plan to non-union represented employees hired after December 2005 and negotiating similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. Further, during 2014, lump-sum settlement payments of $427 million were made from the defined benefit pension trust to certain former employees who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payments and the corresponding benefit obligation was reduced by $529 million. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels through December 31, 2015 for our non-union plans, and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Actuarial Assumptions The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a plan amendment (as described above), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, employee turnover, participant longevity, the expected rates of increase in future compensation levels through December 31, 2015 for our non-union plans, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We utilized a discount rate of 4.00% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2014, compared to 4.75% at December 31, 2013 and 4.00% at December 31, 2012. We utilized a discount rate of 3.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical plans at December 31, 2014, compared to 4.50% at December 31, 2013 and 3.75% at December 31, 2012. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Longevity assumptions are used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants during which they are expected to receive benefit payments. Recent actuarial studies indicate life expectancies are longer and would have the resultant effect of increasing the total expected benefit payments to plan participants. Our benefit obligations at December 31, 2014 reflect the new longevity assumptions which had the effect of increasing the qualified defined benefit pension benefit obligations by $3.4 billion. We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% at December 31, 2014, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $11.8 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of the $2.9 billion for the 2014 remeasurement. The cumulative non- 51 Table of Contents cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates from 6.375% at the end of 2007 to 4.00% at the end of 2014 and investment losses incurred during 2008, which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately 10 years. During 2014, $706 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $850 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2015. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.00% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2014, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2014 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.00% discount rate at December 31, 2014 that was used to compute the expected 2015 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2015 would be lower or higher by approximately $125 million. If the 8.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2014 that was used to compute the expected 2015 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2015 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Funding Considerations We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.0 billion in 2014, $2.25 billion in 2013 and $3.6 billion in 2012, inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. This ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. In July 2012, the U.S. Government passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirements under the PPA. As a result of MAP-21 there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirements. The impact of MAP-21 decreased each year and was scheduled to phase out by 2016. On August 8, 2014, the HATFA was enacted, which extends the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in 2018 and phase out by 2021. Accordingly, the HATFA has the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise would have been had the MAP-21 methodology not been extended. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 94% and 93% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 76% and 78% funded at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $1.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012 as CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that will be phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. We expect the incremental impact of CAS Harmonization will increase successively over years 2014 through 2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2014, our prepayment credits were approximately $10.8 billion, inclusive of the impacts of HATFA, as compared to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2013. The prepayment balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets. 52 Table of Contents Trends We do not plan to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2015 through 2017 because none are required using current assumptions. However, we anticipate recovering approximately $1.6 billion of CAS pension cost in 2015 and our CAS recoveries in 2016 and 2017 to be sequentially higher than in 2015 as we begin to recover the $10.8 billion of prepayment credits at December 31, 2014 under the CAS rules. We expect our 2015 FAS pension expense to be $1.1 billion, which is less than our 2014 FAS pension expense of $1.2 billion, primarily due to the plan amendments announced in June 2014, offset by the impact of the new longevity assumptions and the decline in the discount rate. Also, we expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2015 of about $475 million, as compared to FAS/CAS pension income of $376 million in 2014, primarily due to higher CAS pension costs due to CAS Harmonization. FAS/CAS pension income is expected to increase sequentially from 2015 at an approximate 50% rate annually in 2016 and 2017. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by a state agency. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $965 million and $997 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $836 million and $863 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 12 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). On July 1, 2014, a regulation became effective in California setting the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water at 10 parts per billion (ppb). In May 2014, the Manufacturers and Technology Association filed a suit alleging the 10 ppb threshold is lower than is required to protect public health and thus imposes unjustified costs on the regulated community. We cannot predict the outcome of this suit or whether other challenges may be advanced by the regulated community or environmental groups which had sought a significantly higher and lower standard, respectively. If the new standard remains at 10 ppb, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. In addition, California is reevaluating its existing drinking water standard with respect to a second contaminant, perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is also considering whether to regulate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level, for perchlorate or, if the U.S. EPA were to adopt a standard for hexavalent chromium lower than 10 ppb, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period. 53 Table of Contents Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill Our goodwill balances were $10.9 billion and $10.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. When testing goodwill for impairment, we initially compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any assumed intangible assets that may not have any corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 54 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. Corporate allocations include our postretirement benefit plans liabilities, as determined in accordance with CAS, in order to align the basis of the carrying values with the determination of the fair values of our reporting units, which are measured using CAS pension cost. CAS pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, affects the fair value of each reporting unit. The amount of CAS pension liability allocated to each reporting unit is significantly influenced by a number of factors, including the discount rate used to estimate the obligation. On August 8, 2014, the HATFA was enacted, which extended the pension interest rate relief of the prior MAP-21. As a result, the interest rate used to calculate CAS pension costs recovered under our contracts with the U.S. Government increased with the resulting effect of decreasing the amount of CAS pension liability allocated to each reporting unit, contributing to an increase in the carrying value of each reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of these tests indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, with the exception of our Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment. Technical Services, for which we recorded a $195 million goodwill impairment in 2013, experienced further declines in fair value during 2014. Technical Services which typically has smaller customer contracts of a shorter duration, has been adversely impacted by market pressures such as lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. As a result, we compared the implied value of that reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill, and since the carrying value exceeded the implied value, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 equal to that differential. We continue to experience uncertainty in our business environment due to significant fiscal and economic challenges facing the U.S. Government, our primary customer, as well as market pressures. While initiatives such as the Bipartisan Budget Act provide a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the U.S. Government’s fiscal challenges, budget reductions, including sequestration, remain a long-term concern as the Bipartisan Budget Act retained sequestration cuts for GFYs 2016 through 2021 and the across-the-board spending reduction methodology provided for in the Budget Control Act. Generally, our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our Civil reporting unit within our IS&GS business segment, Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment and certain services businesses within our MST business segment. The Civil reporting unit has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies’ information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. The carrying value of our Civil reporting unit included goodwill of $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. Currently, we estimate that the fair value of our Civil reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a margin of approximately 15%. Budget reductions, contract cancellations and terminations or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to further decline below our current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our current assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Civil reporting unit is at risk of a future goodwill impairment should there be further deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of this reporting unit. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. 55 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard that will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. Unless the FASB delays the effective date of the new standard, it will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2017. See Note 1 (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) for additional information related to this new standard. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $7.9 billion at December 31, 2014 and the outstanding principal amount was $7.0 billion, excluding unamortized discounts of $872 million. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2014. We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $804 million and $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (Note 15). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2014 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2014, investments in the trust totaled $1.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are 56 Table of Contents exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our Statements of Earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2014. 57 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:29.697093
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Business Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics and information services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2015, 78% of our $46.1 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 58% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 21% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Mission Systems and Training (MST) and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash flow1 to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next two years. We expect 2016 net sales will increase in the high single digit range from 2015 levels. The projected growth is driven by the addition of Sikorsky and increased volume expected on the F-35 program, offset by volume declines at our IS&GS and Space Systems business segments. We expect our 2016 segment operating profit will decline in the high single digit range from 2015 levels due to an expected decrease in segment operating profit at our IS&GS, MFC and Space Systems business segments. Operating margin is expected to decline due to costs associated with the Sikorsky acquisition, including the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and inherited restructuring costs associated with actions committed to by Sikorsky prior to acquisition. Accordingly, we expect 2016 segment operating profit margin will be below 2015 levels, in the 10% range. Our 2016 outlook includes amounts for the government IT infrastructure services and technical services businesses we expect to divest. The 2016 outlook will not be adjusted to exclude these businesses until a divestiture is completed. Our outlook for 2016 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2016 budget. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2016 net sales and operating profit margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments. 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 28 Table of Contents Strategic Actions Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation On November 6, 2015, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2015 by and between us and United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of UTC, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) for $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. Sikorsky, a global company primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, service and support of military and commercial helicopters, has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, aligned under the MST business segment. We funded the acquisition with new debt issuances, commercial paper and cash on hand. We and UTC made a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, which treats the transaction as an asset purchase for tax purposes. This election generates a cash tax benefit with an estimated net present value of $1.9 billion for us and our stockholders. The financial results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky operations. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” below for a discussion of the debt we incurred in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition. Strategic Review of Government Information Technology (IT) and Technical Services Businesses Information Systems & Global Solutions Divestiture On January 26, 2016 we entered into definitive agreements to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business segment with Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos) in a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction anticipated to unlock approximately $5.0 billion in estimated enterprise value for our stockholders, including a $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment to us. We intend to use the net proceeds of the transaction to repay debt, pay dividends or repurchase our stock. Additionally, our stockholders will receive approximately 50.5 percent of the outstanding equity of Leidos on a fully diluted basis (approximately 77 million shares) with an estimated value of $3.2 billion based on Leidos’ stock price on the date of announcement. However, the actual value of the stock to be received by our stockholders will depend on the value of such shares at the time of closing of the transaction and our stockholders may receive more or less than the anticipated value. At our election, the distribution may be effected by means of a pro rata dividend in a spin-off transaction or in an exchange offer for outstanding Lockheed Martin Shares in a split-off transaction. The transaction structure, which is subject to market conditions, is currently contemplated to be a split-off transaction resulting in a decrease in our outstanding common shares and a significant book gain at closing. In a split-off transaction, only those stockholders that elect to participate will receive Leidos shares in the merger transaction, provided, that, if the exchange offer is not fully subscribed, Lockheed Martin will spin-off the remaining shares to be converted into Leidos stock in the merger pro rata. Subsequent to the program realignment described below, our IS&GS business segment represents the government IT and technical services businesses that were under strategic review. The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2016. Until closing, IS&GS will operate as a business segment and financial results for the IS&GS business segment will be reported in our continuing operations. Program Realignment During the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned certain programs among our business segments in connection with the strategic review of our government IT and technical services businesses. As part of the realignment: • command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and government cyber programs were transferred from the IS&GS business segment to the MST business segment; • energy solutions programs were transferred from the IS&GS business segment to the MFC business segment; • space ground station programs were transferred from the IS&GS business segment to Space Systems business segment; and • technical services programs were transferred from the MFC business segment to the IS&GS business segment. Subsequent to the program realignment, the government IT and technical services businesses that were under strategic review are now aligned under the IS&GS business segment. The program realignment did not impact our consolidated results of operations. The amounts, discussion and presentation of our business segment financial results for all periods presented reflect this realignment. 29 Table of Contents Other Acquisitions In addition to the previously described acquisition of Sikorsky in 2015, we had the following significant acquisition related activity in each of the prior two years: In 2014, we paid $898 million for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the following acquisitions: • Systems Made Simple – a provider of health information technology solutions, which is included in our IS&GS business segment; • Zeta Associates, Inc. – a designer of systems that enable collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of information for intelligence and defense communities, which is included in our Space Systems business segment; and • Industrial Defender – a provider of cybersecurity solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries, which is included in our IS&GS business segment. In 2013, we paid $269 million for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisition of Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company specializing in information technology, civil government services and the energy market. Amor Group is included in our IS&GS business segment. For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our consolidated financial statements. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Funding Constraints The U.S. Government, our principal customer, continues to face significant fiscal and economic challenges such as financial deficits, budget uncertainty, increasing debt levels, and an economy with restrained growth. To address these challenges, the U.S. Government continues to focus on discretionary spending, entitlement programs, taxes, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. In doing so, the Administration and Congress must balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment largely imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act). The Budget Control Act established limits on discretionary spending, which provided for reductions to planned defense spending of $487 billion over a 10 year period that began with GFY 2012 (a U.S. Government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30). The Budget Control Act also provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, which went into effect on March 1, 2013, that would have reduced planned defense spending by an additional $500 billion over a nine-year period that began in GFY 2013. On November 2, 2015, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015). BBA 2015 raises the limit on the government’s debt until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act by $80 billion, split equally between defense and non-defense spending over the next two years ($50 billion in GFY 2016 and $30 billion in GFY 2017). On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, funding the government through September 30, 2016 and on February 9, 2016, the President submitted a budget proposal for GFY 2017, consistent with BBA 2015 funding levels. BBA 2015 includes discretionary funding for DoD of approximately $580 billion in GFY 2016 and $583 billion in GFY 2017. This funding includes a base budget for the DoD of approximately $521 billion in GFY 2016 and $524 billion in GFY 2017. BBA 2015 also provides approximately $59 billion for DoD Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending in each of GFY 2016 and GFY 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013) passed by Congress in December 2013 alleviated some budget cuts that would have otherwise been instituted through sequestration in GFY 2014 and GFY 2015. Together, BBA 2013 and BBA 2015 (collectively, the Bipartisan Budget Acts) increased discretionary spending limits through GFY 2017. However, the Bipartisan Budget Acts retained sequestration cuts for GFYs 2018 through 2021, including the across-the-board spending reduction methodology provided for in the Budget Control Act. As a result, there remains uncertainty regarding how, or if, sequestration cuts will be applied in GFY 2018 and beyond. DoD and other agencies may have significantly less flexibility in how to apply budget cuts in future years. While the defense budget sustained the largest single reductions under the Budget Control Act, other civil agencies and programs have also been impacted by significant spending reductions. In light of the Budget Control Act and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending by the U.S. Government will remain constrained for a number of years. Additionally, if an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for GFY 2017 or beyond, the U.S. Government may operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and 30 Table of Contents government shutdowns could arise. We anticipate there will continue to be significant debate within the U.S. Government over defense spending throughout the budget appropriations process for GFY 2017 and beyond. The outcome of these debates could have long-term consequences for our industry and company as described below. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products and services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources. Potential Impacts of Budget Reductions While recent budget actions provide a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the U.S. Government’s fiscal challenges, sequestration remains a long-term concern. If not further modified, sequestration could have significant negative impacts on our industry and company in future periods. There may be disruption of ongoing programs, impacts to our supply chain, contractual actions (including partial or complete terminations), potential facilities closures, and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry that will severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge. Sequestration, or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration, could have a material negative effect on our company. Despite the continued uncertainty surrounding U.S. Government budgets, we have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. Additionally, we are seeking to lessen our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government by focusing on expanding into adjacent markets close to our core capabilities and growing international sales but we may not be successful in this strategy. The possibility remains, however, that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S. Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, or budget reductions, including sequestration (particularly in those circumstances where sequestration is implemented across-the-board without regard to national priorities). Additionally, decreases in production volume associated with budget cuts, including sequestration, will increase unit costs making our products less affordable for both our U.S. and international customers. In particular, if sequestration level spending cuts are reinstated in GFY 2018, we may experience significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base. Such activity could result in claims from our suppliers, which may include the amount established in any settlement agreements, the costs of evaluating the supplier settlement proposals, and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements. Budget cuts, including sequestration, could result in restructuring charges, impairment of assets, including goodwill, or other charges. We expect costs associated with claims from our suppliers and restructuring charges will be recovered from our customers. Generally, we expect that the impact of budget reductions on our operating results will lag in certain of our businesses with longer cycles such as our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and our products businesses within our MFC and MST business segments, due to our production contract backlog. However, our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our IS&GS business segment. We have also experienced increased market pressures in these services businesses including lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. Additionally, our services businesses across most of our business segments have experienced lower volume due to improved product field performance that require less service support. International Business A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on expanding our in-country presence and strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and local production joint technology offices. Since 2013, we have acquired Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company, and we have opened new in-country offices including in Israel, United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Qatar that will enable development of ventures to create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace and security sectors. We conduct business with international customers primarily through our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments. In our Aeronautics business segment, there remains strong international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program includes commitments from eight international partner countries and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35. The international role on the program continues to grow as we have successfully delivered aircraft to five international partners, including the first two Norwegian aircraft. In 2015, the first Italian Final Assembly and Check-Out Facility produced F-35 aircraft was delivered. The award of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 9 undefinitized contract action in 2015 included 21 international orders for four international partners and customers. 31 Table of Contents Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. In 2015, the Iraqi F-16 contract was definitized and production continues into 2017. Also, the award from Singapore in 2015 for F-16 aircraft upgrades establishes work into 2023. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to draw interest from various international customers in 2015. Our MFC business segment produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air and missile defense systems, which continue to generate significant international interest. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. During 2015 we received orders for PAC-3 systems from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and South Korea, in addition to the award we received in 2014 to provide PAC-3 missile defense equipment to Qatar. THAAD international customers include the UAE. Other international customers include Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan and Kuwait. Other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products. In our MST business segment, we continue to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, ship integration and test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea and Australia. We have an ongoing program in Canada for combat systems equipment upgrades on 13 Halifax-class frigates. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Qatar, and Australia. Our acquisition of Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the MST business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the UH-60 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk aircraft to foreign military customers, including Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia. The S-76 and S-92 aircraft is sold to commercial customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, and search and rescue fleets in over 30 countries, including customers and end-users in China, Japan, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the United Kingdom. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of a development contracts, multiple production contracts and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the System Development and Demonstration portion of the development contracts will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government continues to complete various operational tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations, and weapons testing, with the F-35 aircraft fleet recently surpassing 50,000 flight hours. Progress continues to be made on the production of aircraft. In July 2015, the U.S. Marine Corps declared that the F-35B had reached initial operating capability, which makes it the first variant available for combat. As of December 31, 2015, we have delivered 154 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners including delivery of the first Italian Final Assembly and Check-Out Facility produced F-35, and have 114 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the aircraft. Cybersecurity On July 9, 2015, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that the background investigation records of 21.5 million current, former and prospective Federal employees and contractors had been compromised as a result of a cyber-security incident. Many of our current as well as former employees were the subjects of background investigations in 32 Table of Contents connection with former government service or as part of the screening process for a security clearance. We are currently assessing the impact of this cyber-security incident but do not yet know the impact, if any, on Lockheed Martin or our current or former employees. Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 46,132 $ 45,600 $ 45,358 Cost of sales (40,932 ) (40,345 ) (41,171) Gross profit 5,200 5,255 4,187 Other income, net 236 337 318 Operating profit (a) 5,436 5,592 4,505 Interest expense (443 ) (340 ) (350) Other non-operating income, net 30 6 — Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 5,023 5,258 4,155 Income tax expense (1,418 ) (1,644 ) (1,205) Net earnings from continuing operations 3,605 3,614 2,950 Net earnings from discontinued operations — — 31 Net earnings $ 3,605 $ 3,614 $ 2,981 Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $ 11.46 $ 11.21 $ 9.04 Discontinued operations — — .09 Total diluted earnings per common share $ 11.46 $ 11.21 $ 9.13 (a) Operating profit includes $45 million of operating loss at Sikorsky, which is less than one percent of consolidated operating profit in 2015. Sikorsky’s operating loss is net of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations. Net Sales We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Product sales are predominantly generated in our Aeronautics, MFC, MST and Space Systems business segments and most of our service sales are generated in our IS&GS and MST business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Products $ 35,882 $ 36,093 $ 35,691 Services 10,250 9,507 9,667 Total net sales $ 46,132 $ 45,600 $ 45,358 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method. 33 Table of Contents Product Sales Our product sales represent 78% of our total sales in 2015 and 79% of our total sales in 2014. Product sales decreased $211 million, or 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Lower product sales of about $290 million at Space Systems, approximately $250 million at MFC and approximately $110 million at IS&GS were offset by higher product sales of about $320 million at MST and approximately $120 million at Aeronautics. The decrease in product sales at Space Systems was attributable to lower volume for government satellite programs (primarily Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF). Product sales at MFC decreased due to lower volume on air and missile defense systems programs (primarily PAC-3). The decline in product sales at IS&GS was a result of key program completions, lower customer funding levels and increased competition, coupled with the fragmentation of existing large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. The increase in product sales at MST was primarily attributable to product sales from Sikorsky, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. Product sales at Aeronautics increased primarily due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts, as well as increased deliveries on our C-5 program; partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries for our C-130 and F-16 programs and lower sustainment activities on our F-22 program. Our product sales represent 79% of our total sales in both 2014 and 2013. Product sales increased $402 million, or 1%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Higher product sales of about $815 million at Aeronautics and approximately $280 million at MFC were partially offset by lower product sales of about $275 million at Space Systems, approximately $235 million at IS&GS and approximately $185 million at MST. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was attributable to higher volume on F-35 production contracts and sustainment activities, increased aircraft deliveries (F-16 program) and increased risk retirements (F-22 program). Product sales at MFC increased as a result of increased volume on air and missile defense systems programs (primarily THAAD), and increased deliveries on fire control programs (including the Apache Fire Control System (Apache)). The decline in product sales at Space Systems was due to lower volume for government satellite programs (primarily Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Global Positioning System III (GPS-III), and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)); and as a result of mission solutions’ programs transitioning from development to operations and support, wind-down or completion of certain programs, and defense budget cuts. The decline in product sales at Space Systems was partially offset by increased volume in the Orion program (primarily the first unmanned test flight of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV)). Lower product sales at IS&GS were primarily due to the wind down or completion of certain programs and decreased volume in technical services programs reflecting market pressures. Lower product sales at MST were primarily driven by the wind-down or completion of certain command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs (primarily PTDS). Service Sales Our service sales represent 22% of our total sales in 2015 and 21% of our total sales in 2014. Service sales increased $743 million, or 8%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to higher service sales of approximately $530 million at Aeronautics and about $190 million at Space Systems. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily F-35). The increase in service sales at Space Systems was primarily due to service sales of entities acquired in the third quarter of 2014. Our service sales represent 21% of our total sales in both 2014 and 2013. Service sales decreased $160 million, or 2%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Lower service sales of approximately $225 million at IS&GS and approximately $120 million at MST were partially offset by higher service sales at Space Systems of about $190 million. The decline in service sales at IS&GS was primarily due to various technical services programs as a result of decreased volume reflecting market pressures. The decline in service sales at MST was primarily due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs. The increase in sales at Space Systems was primarily due to commercial space transportation programs resulting from launch-related activities. 34 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Cost of sales – products $ (32,006 ) $ (31,965 ) $ (31,346) % of product sales 89.2 % 88.6 % 87.8% Cost of sales – services (9,011 ) (8,393 ) (8,588) % of service sales 87.9 % 88.3 % 88.8% Goodwill impairment charges — (119 ) (195) Severance charges (102 ) — (201) Other unallocated, net 187 132 (841) Total cost of sales $ (40,932 ) $ (40,345 ) $ (41,171) Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product Costs Product costs increased approximately $41 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Increased product costs of approximately $445 million at MST and about $180 million at Aeronautics, were offset by decreases in product costs of approximately $325 million at Space Systems, $195 million at MFC and $65 million at IS&GS. Increases in product costs at MST were due primarily to the Sikorsky acquisition, including costs of Sikorsky products, intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were attributable to the reasons stated above for higher product sales, as well as decreased risk retirements (primarily F-22). The changes in product costs at Space Systems, MFC and IS&GS were attributable to the reasons stated above for higher product sales. Product costs increased $619 million, or 2%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Product costs increased approximately $815 million at Aeronautics and approximately $325 million at MFC. Increases in product costs at Aeronautics and MFC were primarily due to the reasons described above for higher product sales at each respective business segment and net warranty reserve adjustments recorded in 2014 at MFC (including Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), and Guided Multiple Launcher Rocker Systems (GMLRS)). These increases in product costs were partially offset by decreases of about $195 million at IS&GS, $255 million at Space Systems and $70 million at MST, primarily due to the reasons described above for lower product sales at each respective business segment. Additionally, lower product costs at MST were partially offset by costs related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in the prior year (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program) that were not repeated in 2014 and higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs during 2014. The 0.8% increase in product costs as a percentage of product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the reasons described above for increasing product costs at MFC, and decreased risk retirements at Aeronautics (primarily F-16). Service Costs Service costs increased $618 million, or 7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Higher service costs of approximately $450 million at Aeronautics and about $230 million at Space Systems were due to the reasons stated above for higher service sales. These increases in service costs were partially offset by a decrease in service costs of about $80 million at MFC due primarily to lower service costs on various air and missile defense programs. Service costs decreased $195 million, or 2%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Lower service costs of about $230 million at IS&GS, approximately $100 million at MST, and approximately $40 million at Aeronautics were partially offset by an increase in service costs of approximately $160 million at Space Systems. The decline at IS&GS was primarily attributable to 35 Table of Contents lower volume for various technical services programs. The decline at MST was primarily attributable to lower costs upon wind-down or completion of certain programs. The decline at Aeronautics was mostly attributable to decreased sustainment activities. The increase at Space Systems was primarily attributable to commercial space transportation programs due to launch-related activities. The 0.5% decrease in service costs as a percentage of service sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to items decreasing service costs at IS&GS. Goodwill Impairment Charges In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. Additionally, as part of our previously described program realignment, goodwill was re-allocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis and goodwill impairment tests were performed prior and subsequent to the realignment. In connection with our goodwill impairment testing in 2015, we determined there was no goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $119 million and $195 million, which reduced our net earnings by $107 million ($.33 per share) and $176 million ($.54 per share). For additional information, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Goodwill” section below and “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. Restructuring Charges 2015 Actions During 2015, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $102 million, of which $67 million related to our MST business segment and $35 million related to our IS&GS business segment (prior to realignment). These charges reduced our 2015 net earnings by $66 million ($.21 per share). These severance actions resulted from a review of future workload projections and to reduce our costs in order to improve the affordability of our products and services. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we have paid approximately $18 million in severance payments associated with these actions. In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. These actions included a global workforce reduction of approximately 1,400 production-related positions and facilities consolidations. As of December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring costs associated with these actions are approximately $15 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2016. Net of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we also expect to incur an additional $40 million of costs in 2016 related to these actions. 2013 Actions During 2013, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $201 million, of which $83 million, $37 million and $81 million related to our IS&GS, MST and Space Systems business segments (prior to realignment). These charges reduced our 2013 net earnings by $130 million ($.40 per share) and primarily related to a plan we committed to in November 2013 to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce our total workforce by approximately 4,000 positions. These charges also include $30 million related to certain severance actions that occurred in the first quarter of 2013, which were subsequently paid in 2013. The November 2013 plan resulted from a strategic review of these businesses’ facility capacity and future workload projections. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. As of December 31, 2015, we have paid approximately $153 million in severance payments associated with this action, of which approximately $46 million, $92 million and $15 million was paid in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The remaining severance payments are expected to be paid in 2016. We also expect to incur total accelerated costs (e.g., accelerated depreciation expense related to long-lived assets at sites closed) and incremental costs (e.g., relocation of equipment and other employee related costs) of approximately $10 million, $50 million and $180 million at our IS&GS, MST and Space Systems business segments through the completion of this plan in 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred total accelerated and incremental costs of approximately $225 million, of which approximately $115 million, $90 million and $20 million was recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The accelerated and incremental costs are recorded as incurred in cost of sales on our Statements of Earnings and included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. 36 Table of Contents We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. Of the total severance, accelerated and incremental costs mentioned above, we recovered approximately $65 million in 2015 and $50 million in 2014 and expect to recover approximately $60 million in 2016. Other Unallocated, Net Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the Business Segment Results of Operations section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was $187 million of income in 2015, $132 million of income in 2014 and $841 million of expense in 2013. The fluctuation between each respective period was primarily attributable to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income of $471 million in 2015 and $376 million in 2014, compared to expense of $482 million in 2013, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The changes in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment between the periods were attributable to various items impacting the calculations of financial accounting standards (FAS) pension expense and U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost. FAS pension expense in 2015 and 2014 was less than 2013 primarily due to the June 2014 plan amendments to certain of our defined benefit pension plans to freeze future retirement benefits, partially offset by the impact of using new longevity (also known as mortality) assumptions (Note 11). The higher CAS pension cost in 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” for more discussion of our CAS pension cost. Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and other various items. Other income, net in 2015 was $236 million, compared to $337 million in 2014 and $318 million in 2013. The decrease in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision to divest Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) in 2016 and non-recoverable transaction costs of approximately $45 million associated with the Sikorsky acquisition and the strategic review of our government IT and technical services businesses, partially offset by fluctuations in other various costs, none of which were individually significant. The asset impairment charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit related to LMCFT of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. Earnings from equity method investees in 2015 were comparable to 2014 (reflecting decreased earnings from equity method investees in our Space Systems business segment, offset by increased earnings form Sikorsky equity method investees). The increase in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to fluctuations in earnings from equity method investees in our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2015 was $443 million, compared to $340 million in 2014 and $350 million in 2013. The increase in interest expense in 2015 relates to debt we incurred to fund the acquisition of Sikorsky, and the issuance of notes in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” for a discussion of our debt. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net increased $24 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015. Other non-operating income, net in 2014 was comparable to 2013. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 28.2% for 2015, 31.3% for 2014, and 29.0% for 2013. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. These benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of the non-cash goodwill impairment charges in 2014 and 2013. The U.S. manufacturing deduction benefit for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reduced our effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points. 37 Table of Contents In 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended and reinstated, retroactive to the beginning of 2015, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.4 percentage points. In 2014, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for one year, retroactive to the beginning of 2014, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.9 percentage point. In 2013, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for two years, retroactive to the beginning of 2012. As a result, the effective income tax rate for 2013 reflects the credit for all of 2013 and 2012, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points. As a result of electing to treat the acquisition of the stock of Sikorsky as an asset acquisition under section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect tax deductions for the amortization of intangibles and goodwill over 15 years to reduce our tax payments by a net present value of approximately $1.9 billion. As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest LMCFT in 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit reduced the effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point in 2015. A limited amount of the non-cash goodwill impairment charges will be deductible for tax purposes. Accordingly, the non-cash goodwill impairment charges increased our effective income tax rates by 0.6 percentage point for 2014 and 1.2 percentage points for 2013 (Note 1). Future changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and our deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $5.9 billion and $5.5 billion, based on a 35% Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If legislation reducing the Federal statutory income tax rate to 25% had been enacted at December 31, 2015, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $1.7 billion and we would have recorded a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $1.7 billion. This additional expense would be less if the legislation phased in the tax rate reduction or if the final rate was higher than 25%. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion ($11.46 per share) in 2015, $3.6 billion ($11.21 per share) in 2014 and $3.0 billion ($9.04 per share) in 2013. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately eleven million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 and approximately five million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 as a result of share repurchases, which were partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2013 include a benefit of $31 million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to a business sold prior to 2013. 38 Table of Contents Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, IS&GS, MFC, MST and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. The amounts, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect the program realignment described above for all periods presented and include the results of the acquired Sikorsky business from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is part of our Space Systems business segment, is our primary equity method investee. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (Note 1) and significant severance actions (Note 15); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 3); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2015 and 2014, we have FAS/CAS pension income and, conversely, to the extent FAS pension expense exceeds CAS pension cost, which occurred for 2013, we have FAS/CAS pension expense. 39 Table of Contents The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (Note 13) for all years presented. Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales Aeronautics $ 15,570 $ 14,920 $ 14,123 Information Systems & Global Solutions 5,596 5,654 6,115 Missiles and Fire Control 6,770 7,092 6,795 Mission Systems and Training 9,091 8,732 9,037 Space Systems 9,105 9,202 9,288 Total net sales $ 46,132 $ 45,600 $ 45,358 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,681 $ 1,649 $ 1,612 Information Systems & Global Solutions 508 472 498 Missiles and Fire Control 1,282 1,344 1,379 Mission Systems and Training 844 936 1,065 Space Systems 1,171 1,187 1,198 Total business segment operating profit 5,486 5,588 5,752 Unallocated items FAS/CAS pension adjustment FAS pension expense (a) (1,142 ) (1,144 ) (1,948) Less: CAS pension cost (b) 1,613 1,520 1,466 FAS/CAS pension income (expense) (c) 471 376 (482) Goodwill impairment charges (d) — (119 ) (195) Severance charges (e) (102 ) — (201) Stock-based compensation (138 ) (164 ) (189) Other, net (f), (g) (281 ) (89 ) (180) Total unallocated, net (50 ) 4 (1,247) Total consolidated operating profit $ 5,436 $ 5,592 $ 4,505 (a) FAS pension expense in 2015 and 2014 was less than in 2013 primarily due to the June 2014 plan amendments to certain of our defined benefit pension plans to freeze future retirement benefits, partially offset by the impact of using new longevity assumptions (Note 11). (b) The higher CAS pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. (c) We expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2016 of about $975 million as further discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” below. (d) We recognized non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the Technical Services reporting unit within our MFC business segment in 2014 and 2013. For more information, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements. (e) See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges” for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (f) Other, net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million related to our decision to divest LMCFT in 2016. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million. (g) Other, net in 2015 includes approximately $45 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky and the strategic review of our government IT and technical services businesses. 40 Table of Contents The following tables reflect the impacts of our program realignment on net sales and operating profit for each of our business segments (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 Prior to Realignment Government IT Reclassification Technical Svcs Reclassification As Adjusted Net sales Aeronautics $ 15,570 $ — $ — $ 15,570 Information Systems & Global Solutions 7,458 (2,480 ) 618 5,596 Missiles and Fire Control 7,366 63 (659 ) 6,770 Mission Systems and Training 7,697 1,353 41 9,091 Space Systems 8,041 1,064 — 9,105 Total net sales $ 46,132 $ — $ — $ 46,132 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,681 $ — $ — $ 1,681 Information Systems & Global Solutions 628 (173 ) 53 508 Missiles and Fire Control 1,332 5 (55 ) 1,282 Mission Systems and Training 800 42 2 844 Space Systems 1,045 126 — 1,171 Total business segment operating profit 5,486 — — 5,486 Unallocated items, net (50 ) — — (50) Total consolidated operating profit $ 5,436 $ — $ — $ 5,436 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Prior to Realignment Government IT Reclassification Technical Svcs Reclassification As Adjusted Net sales Aeronautics $ 14,920 $ — $ — $ 14,920 Information Systems & Global Solutions 7,788 (2,810 ) 676 5,654 Missiles and Fire Control 7,680 155 (743 ) 7,092 Mission Systems and Training 7,147 1,518 67 8,732 Space Systems 8,065 1,137 — 9,202 Total net sales $ 45,600 $ — $ — $ 45,600 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,649 $ — $ — $ 1,649 Information Systems & Global Solutions 699 (259 ) 32 472 Missiles and Fire Control 1,358 21 (35 ) 1,344 Mission Systems and Training 843 90 3 936 Space Systems 1,039 148 — 1,187 Total business segment operating profit 5,588 — — 5,588 Unallocated items, net 4 — — 4 Total consolidated operating profit $ 5,592 $ — $ — $ 5,592 41 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2013 Prior to Realignment Government IT Reclassification Technical Svcs Reclassification As Adjusted Net sales Aeronautics $ 14,123 $ — $ — $ 14,123 Information Systems & Global Solutions 8,367 (3,248 ) 996 6,115 Missiles and Fire Control 7,757 172 (1,134 ) 6,795 Mission Systems and Training 7,153 1,746 138 9,037 Space Systems 7,958 1,330 — 9,288 Total net sales $ 45,358 $ — $ — $ 45,358 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,612 $ — $ — $ 1,612 Information Systems & Global Solutions 759 (316 ) 55 498 Missiles and Fire Control 1,431 9 (61 ) 1,379 Mission Systems and Training 905 154 6 1,065 Space Systems 1,045 153 — 1,198 Total business segment operating profit 5,752 — — 5,752 Unallocated items, net (1,247 ) — — (1,247) Total consolidated operating profit $ 4,505 $ — $ — $ 4,505 The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $99.6 billion, $80.5 billion and $82.6 billion at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Backlog at December 31, 2015 includes approximately $15.6 billion of Sikorsky backlog and $4.8 billion of backlog related to our IS&GS business segment, which we plan to divest in 2016. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer – Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $70.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. 42 Table of Contents We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our Space Systems, Aeronautics and IS&GS business segments, offset by a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our MST and MFC business segments. The decrease in our consolidated net adjustments in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2015 are inclusive of approximately $645 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at MST and on commercial satellite programs at Space Systems. The consolidated net adjustments for 2014 are inclusive of approximately $650 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs at MST and net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including JASSM and GMLRS) at MFC as described in the respective business segment’s results of operations below. The consolidated net adjustments for 2013 are inclusive of approximately $600 million in unfavorable items, which include significant profit reductions on the F-35 development contract and on the C-5 program. 43 Table of Contents Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-5M Super Galaxy and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 15,570 $ 14,920 $ 14,123 Operating profit 1,681 1,649 1,612 Operating margins 10.8 % 11.1 % 11.4% Backlog at year-end $ 31,800 $ 27,600 $ 28,000 2015 compared to 2014 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2015 increased $650 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.4 billion for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities; and approximately $150 million for the C-5 program due to increased deliveries (nine aircraft delivered in 2015 compared to seven delivered in 2014). The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $350 million for the C-130 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (21 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 24 delivered in 2014), lower sustainment activities and aircraft contract mix; approximately $200 million due to decreased volume and lower risk retirements on various programs; approximately $195 million for the F-16 program due to fewer deliveries (11 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 17 delivered in 2014); and approximately $190 million for the F-22 program as a result of decreased sustainment activities. Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2015 increased $32 million, or 2%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased by approximately $240 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume and risk retirements; and approximately $40 million for the C-5 program due to increased risk retirements. These increases were offset by lower operating profit of approximately $90 million for the F-22 program due to lower risk retirements; approximately $70 million for the C-130 program as a result of the reasons stated above for lower net sales; and approximately $80 million due to decreased volume and risk retirements on various programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. 2014 compared to 2013 Aeronautics’ net sales increased $797 million, or 6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $790 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume and sustainment activities; about $55 million for the F-16 program due to increased deliveries (17 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 13 delivered in 2013) partially offset by contract mix; and approximately $45 million for the F-22 program due to increased risk retirements. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the F-35 development contract due to decreased volume, partially offset by the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013; and about $40 million for the C-130 program due to fewer deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 25 delivered in 2013) and decreased sustainment activities, partially offset by contract mix. Aeronautics’ operating profit increased $37 million, or 2%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $85 million for the F-35 development contract due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013; about $75 million for the F-22 program due to increased risk retirements; approximately $50 million for the C-130 program due to increased risk retirements and contract mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries; and about $25 million for the C-5 program due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013. The increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $130 million for the F-16 program due to decreased risk retirements, partially offset by increased deliveries; and about $70 million for sustainment activities due to decreased risk retirements and volume. Operating profit was comparable for F-35 production contracts as higher volume was offset by lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $105 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. 44 Table of Contents Backlog Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 and C-130 programs. Backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on F-16 and F-22 programs. Trends We expect Aeronautics’ 2016 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2015 due to increased volume on the F-35 and C-130 programs, partially offset by decreased volume on the F-16 program. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range, driven by increased volume on the F-35 program offset by contract mix that results in a slight decrease in operating margins between years. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise, integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence and other government customers. IS&GS’ Technical Services business provides a comprehensive portfolio of technical and sustainment services. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies’ information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. IS&GS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 5,596 $ 5,654 $ 6,115 Operating profit 508 472 498 Operating margins 9.1 % 8.3 % 8.1% Backlog at year-end $ 4,800 $ 6,000 $ 6,300 2015 compared to 2014 IS&GS’ net sales decreased $58 million, or 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $395 million as a result of key program completions, lower customer funding levels and increased competition, coupled with the fragmentation of existing large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price when re-competed (including CMS-CITIC). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $230 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $110 million due to the start-up of new programs and growth in recently awarded programs. IS&GS’ operating profit increased $36 million, or 8%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to improved program performance and risk retirements, offset by decreased operating profit resulting from the activities mentioned above for net sales. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $70 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. 2014 compared to 2013 IS&GS’ net sales decreased $461 million, or 8%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of about $475 million due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs, driven by reductions in direct warfighter support (including JIEDDO); and approximately $320 million due to decreased volume in technical services programs reflecting market pressures. The decreases were offset by higher net sales of about $330 million due to the start-up of new programs, growth in recently awarded programs and integration of recently acquired companies. IS&GS’ operating profit decreased $26 million, or 5%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to the activities mentioned above for sales, partially offset by severance recoveries related to the restructuring announced in November 2013 of approximately $20 million in 2014. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were comparable in 2014 and 2013. 45 Table of Contents Backlog Backlog decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to sales being recognized on several multi-year programs (such as HMSC, NISC III, CIOG and NSF ASC) related to prior year awards and a limited number of large new business awards. Backlog decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower customer funding levels and declining activities on direct warfighter support programs impacted by defense budget reductions. Trends We expect IS&GS’ 2016 net sales to decline in the high-single digit percentage range as compared to 2015, primarily driven by key loss contracts in an increasingly competitive environment, along with volume contraction on the segment’s major contracts. Operating profit is expected to decline at a higher percentage range in 2016, as compared to net sales percentage declines, driven by higher margin program losses and re-compete programs awarded at lower margins. Accordingly, 2016 margins are expected to be lower than 2015 results. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, Sniper®, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 6,770 $ 7,092 $ 6,795 Operating profit 1,282 1,344 1,379 Operating margins 18.9 % 19.0 % 20.3% Backlog at year-end $ 15,500 $ 13,300 $ 14,300 2015 compared to 2014 MFC’s net sales in 2015 decreased $322 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $345 million for air and missile defense programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily PAC-3) and lower volume (primarily THAAD); and approximately $85 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS)) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, partially offset by increased deliveries for Hellfire. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $55 million for energy solutions programs due to increased volume. MFC’s operating profit in 2015 decreased $62 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $100 million for fire control programs due primarily to lower risk retirements (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER); and approximately $65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily Hellfire and GMLRS) and fewer deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $75 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased risk retirements (primarily THAAD). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $60 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014. 2014 compared to 2013 MFC’s net sales increased $297 million, or 4%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $180 million for air and missile defense programs primarily due to increased volume for THAAD; about $115 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (including Apache); and about $125 million for various other programs due to increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $115 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and Army Tactical Missile System). MFC’s operating profit decreased $35 million, or 3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $20 million for tactical missile programs due to net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including JASSM and GMLRS) and fewer deliveries; and approximately $45 million for various other programs due to lower risk retirements. The decreases were offset by higher operating profit of approximately $20 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD and PAC-3); and about 46 Table of Contents $15 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Apache), partially offset by lower risk retirements (primarily Sniper®). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $95 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. Backlog Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, LANTIRN/Sniper and certain tactical missile programs, partially offset by lower orders on THAAD. Backlog decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on THAAD and fire control systems programs, partially offset by higher orders on certain tactical missile programs and PAC-3. Trends We expect MFC’s net sales to be flat or experience a slight decline in 2016 as compared to 2015. Operating profit is expected to decrease by approximately 20 percent, driven by contract mix and fewer risk retirements in 2016 compared to 2015. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2015 levels. Mission Systems and Training As previously described, on November 6, 2015, we acquired Sikorsky and aligned the Sikorsky business under our MST business segment. The results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. As a result, our consolidated operating results and MST business segment operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky operations. Our MST business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters, ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, MST supports the needs of customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. MST’s major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, Space Fence, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, and TPQ-53 Radar System. MST’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 9,091 $ 8,732 $ 9,037 Operating profit 844 936 1,065 Operating margins 9.3 % 10.7 % 11.8% Backlog at year-end $ 30,100 $ 13,300 $ 12,600 2015 compared to 2014 MST’s net sales in 2015 increased $359 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $400 million from Sikorsky, net of adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $220 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, primarily due to the ramp-up of recently awarded programs (Space Fence). These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $150 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume as a result of in-theater force reductions (primarily Persistent Threat Detection System); and approximately $105 million for ship and aviation systems programs primarily due to decreased volume (Merlin Capability Sustainment Program). MST’s operating profit in 2015 decreased $92 million, or 10%, compared to 2014. Operating profit decreased by approximately $75 million due to performance matters on an international program; approximately $45 million for Sikorsky due primarily to intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $15 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, primarily due to investments made in connection with a recently awarded next generation radar technology program, partially offset by higher risk retirements (including Halifax Class Modernization). These decreases were partially offset by approximately $20 million in increased operating profit for training and logistics services programs, primarily due to reserves recorded on certain programs in 2014 that were not repeated in 2015. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014. 47 Table of Contents 2014 compared to 2013 MST’s net sales decreased $305 million, or 3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Net sales decreased by approximately $305 million due to the wind-down or completion of certain C4ISR programs (primarily PTDS); about $85 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume and deliveries; and about $55 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program). The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $80 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to increased volume (primarily Space Fence); and approximately $40 million for training and logistics solutions programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Close Combat Tactical Trainer). MST’s operating profit decreased $129 million, or 12%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program); approximately $55 million due to the reasons described above for lower C4ISR program sales, as well as performance matters on an international program; and approximately $45 million due to higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs. The decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $45 million for performance matters and reserves recorded in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014; and about $60 million for various programs due to increased risk retirements (including MH-60 and radar surveillance programs). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $85 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. Backlog Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of Sikorsky backlog, as well as higher orders on new program starts (such as Australian Defence Force Pilot Training System). Backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher orders on new program starts (such as Space Fence). Trends We expect MST’s 2016 net sales to increase in the mid-double digit percentage range compared to 2015 net sales due to the inclusion of Sikorsky programs for a full year, partially offset by a decline in volume due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs. Operating profit is expected to be equivalent to 2015 on higher volume, and operating margin is expected to decline due to costs associated with the Sikorsky acquisition, including the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and inherited restructuring costs associated with actions committed to by Sikorsky prior to acquisition. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space Systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion, Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), AEHF, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), and MUOS. Operating profit for our Space Systems business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 9,105 $ 9,202 $ 9,288 Operating profit 1,171 1,187 1,198 Operating margins 12.9 % 12.9 % 12.9% Backlog at year-end $ 17,400 $ 20,300 $ 21,400 2015 compared to 2014 Space Systems’ net sales in 2015 decreased $97 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to approximately $335 million lower net sales for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily AEHF) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs; and approximately $55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $235 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $75 million for the Orion program due to increased volume. 48 Table of Contents Space Systems’ operating profit in 2015 decreased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for government satellite programs due primarily to increased risk retirements. This increase was offset by lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for commercial satellite programs due to performance matters on certain programs; and approximately $35 million due to decreased equity earnings in joint ventures. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $105 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. 2014 compared to 2013 Space Systems’ net sales decreased $86 million, or 1%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $335 million for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily AEHF, GPS-III and MUOS); $190 million due to mission solutions’ programs transitioning from development to operations and support, wind-down or completion of certain programs, and defense budget cuts; and about $45 million for various other programs due to decreased volume. The decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $340 million for the Orion program due to increased volume (primarily the first unmanned test flight of the Orion MPCV); and about $145 million for commercial space transportation programs due to launch-related activities. Space Systems’ operating profit for 2014 was comparable to 2013. Operating profit decreased by approximately $20 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume (primarily AEHF and GPS-III), partially offset by increased risk retirements (primarily MUOS); and about $20 million due to decreased equity earnings for joint ventures. The decreases were offset by higher operating profit of approximately $30 million for the Orion program due to increased volume. Operating profit was reduced by approximately $40 million for charges, net of recoveries, related to the restructuring action announced in November 2013. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $10 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. Equity earnings Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems (primarily ULA) represented approximately $245 million, $280 million and $300 million, or 21%, 24% and 25% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2015, 2014 and 2013. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs and the Orion program and higher sales on the Orion program. Backlog decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders and higher sales on the Orion program, partially offset by higher orders on SBIRS. Trends We expect Space Systems’ 2016 net sales to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2015, primarily driven by program lifecycles on government satellite programs. Operating profit is expected to decline by approximately 10 percent, primarily driven by contract mix and slightly lower equity earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. As a result, operating profit margin is expected to decline slightly between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2015. First, we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by 10% to $1.65 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $3.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. Further, based on a cash deployment initiative we announced in October 2014, we plan to reduce our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, market conditions and our fiduciary obligations permitting. This plan was not affected by our acquisition of Sikorsky. 49 Table of Contents We have accessed the capital markets opportunistically as we did in February 2015 when we issued $2.25 billion of long-term debt and as needed as we did in November 2015 when we issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Sikorsky. We also used a combination of short-term debt financing, commercial paper and available cash to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as discussed in “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” and “Note 10 – Debt” of our consolidated financial statements. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our revolving credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows. We expect to receive a tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the anticipated divestiture of our IS&GS business segment in the third or fourth quarter of 2016 that we intend to use to repay debt, pay dividends or repurchase stock, although the timing and closing of the transaction are uncertain and subject to obtaining Leidos stockholder and regulatory approvals and receipt of opinions of tax counsel. As described in the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below, we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, should they occur. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2015, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2015 and those planned for 2016 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities, inclusive of our efforts to consolidate and reduce leased facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. 50 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 1,446 $ 2,617 $ 1,898 Operating activities Net earnings 3,605 3,614 2,981 Non-cash adjustments 821 876 1,570 Changes in working capital (846 ) (372 ) (98) Other, net 1,521 (252 ) 93 Net cash provided by operating activities 5,101 3,866 4,546 Net cash used for investing activities (9,734 ) (1,723 ) (1,121) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 4,277 (3,314 ) (2,706) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (356) (1,171 ) 719 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,090 $ 1,446 $ 2,617 Operating Activities 2015 compared to 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower pension contributions, partially offset by decreases in working capital and higher tax payments. The $1.8 billion increase in cash flows related to Other, net in the table above is primarily because we made no contributions to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension trust in 2015 compared to $2.0 billion in 2014. We made $5.0 million in contributions to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2015. The increase in cash flows related to Other, net was offset by higher federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, of approximately $210 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the absence of refunds received in 2015 (prior year’s tax refunds were attributable to timing of discretionary pension contributions made during the fourth quarter of the respective previous years). The $474 million decrease in cash flows related to working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to an increase in receivables due to timing of customer collections (primarily F-35 contracts) as well as timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under the caption “Funding Considerations”) for discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding. 2014 compared to 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $680 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher tax payments, net of refunds received and increases in working capital. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were approximately $760 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in net income and lower refunds received in 2014 (attributable to timing of discretionary pension contributions made during the fourth quarter of 2012). The decrease of $274 million in cash provided by working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was primarily attributable to lower cash receipts related to accounts receivable, primarily timing on the F-35 production contracts (including amounts received in 2013 from resolving U.S. Government contractual withholds that were not repeated in 2014). Partially offsetting the decreases in operating cash flows were lower pension contributions in 2014. We made $2.0 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2014, compared to $2.25 billion in 2013. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities increased $8.0 billion and $602 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased acquisition activities. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $9.0 billion in 2015 for the Sikorsky acquisition, net of cash acquired (Note 3). We paid $898 million in 2014 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Zeta, Systems Made Simple, and Industrial Defender. In 2013, we paid $269 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of Amor Group. 51 Table of Contents Capital expenditures amounted to $939 million in 2015, $845 million in 2014 and $836 million in 2013. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software. Additionally, in 2015, we received cash proceeds of approximately $165 million related to three properties sold in California. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased $7.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to proceeds from new debt issuances, partially offset by increased repurchases of common stock and higher dividends paid. Net cash used for financing activities increased $608 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2014, higher dividends paid and increased repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term notes in 2013. In February 2015, we received net proceeds of $2.21 billion for the issuance of $2.25 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes. In November 2015, we borrowed $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes and received net proceeds of $6.9 billion (the November 2015 Notes). These proceeds were used to repay $6.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility that was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Sikorsky acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, to partially finance the Sikorsky acquisition we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0 billion under our commercial paper program. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” for more information about our debt financing activities. We paid dividends totaling $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015, $1.8 billion ($5.49 per share) in 2014 and $1.5 billion ($4.78 per share) in 2013. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. We declared quarterly dividends of $1.50 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015; $1.33 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2014 and $1.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014; and $1.15 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2013 and $1.33 per share during the fourth quarter of 2013. We paid $3.1 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion to repurchase 15.2 million, 11.5 million and 16.2 million shares of our common stock during 2015, 2014 and 2013. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $174 million, $308 million and $827 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 2.2 million shares, 3.7 million shares and 10.0 million shares of our common stock. In 2013, we repaid $150 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.38% due to their scheduled maturities. Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $400 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash had been repatriated at the end of 2015, we estimate that about $48 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits. Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, amounted to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. 52 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facilities On October 9, 2015, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2016. The 5-year Facility, which expires on October 9, 2020, is available for general corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the new credit facility up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. In contemplation of our acquisition of Sikorsky, on October 9, 2015, we also entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-day Facility, and together with the 5-year Facility, the Facilities) with various banks that provided $7.0 billion of funding for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Sikorsky. Concurrent with the consummation of the Sikorsky acquisition, we borrowed $6.0 billion under the 364-day Facility. On November 23, 2015, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility with proceeds received from the issuance of the November 2015 Notes described below and terminated any remaining commitments of the lenders under the 364-day Facility. Borrowings under the Facilities are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the Facilities’ agreements. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5-year Facility agreement. Long-Term Debt On November 23, 2015, we issued $7.0 billion of notes (the November 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering. We received net proceeds of $6.9 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The November 2015 Notes consist of: • $750 million maturing in 2018 with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% (the 2018 Notes); • $1.25 billion maturing in 2020 with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% (the 2020 Notes); • $500 million maturing in 2023 with a fixed interest rate of 3.10% (the 2023 Notes); • $2.0 billion maturing in 2026 with a fixed interest rate of 3.55% (the 2026 Notes); • $500 million maturing in 2036 with a fixed interest rate of 4.50% (the 2036 Notes), and • $2.0 billion maturing in 2046 with a fixed interest rate of 4.70% (the 2046 Notes). We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the November 2015 Notes and unpaid interest at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Interest is payable on the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes on May 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on May 23, 2016; on the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016; and on the 2036 Notes and the 2046 Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2016. The November 2015 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds of the November 2015 Notes were used to repay the $6.0 billion of borrowings under our 364-day Facility and for general Corporate purposes. On February 20, 2015, we issued $2.25 billion of notes (the February 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering. We received net proceeds of $2.21 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The February 2015 Notes consist of $750 million maturing in 2025 with a fixed interest rate of 2.90%, $500 million maturing in 2035 with a fixed interest rate of 3.60% and $1.0 billion maturing in 2045 with a fixed interest rate of 3.80%. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Interest on the notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2015. These notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds of the February 2015 Notes were used for general Corporate purposes. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. 53 Table of Contents Commercial Paper We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion credit facility. In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0 billion under our commercial paper program. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows. Stockholders’ Equity Our stockholders’ equity was $3.1 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $303 million from December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of 15.2 million common shares for $3.1 billion; and dividends declared of $1.9 billion during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $3.6 billion; employee stock activity of $660 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation); and the amortization of $850 million in 2015 postretirement benefit plan expense, offset by the re-measurements of our postretirement benefit plans of $351 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $2.4 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2015. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2015, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 16,181 $ 953 $ 750 $ 2,150 $ 12,328 Interest payments 11,224 623 1,259 1,192 8,150 Other liabilities 2,892 313 546 365 1,668 Operating lease obligations 793 205 289 165 134 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 40,455 18,492 15,700 4,792 1,471 Capital expenditures 290 233 55 2 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 71,835 $ 20,819 $ 18,599 $ 8,666 $ 23,751 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only and excludes $18 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture, for which the debt is not guaranteed by us. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2015. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $36.7 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. 54 Table of Contents Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. The costs to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The ability to recover investments that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2015, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $16 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and MST business segments, most of which extend through 2028. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2015 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2015, ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2015, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2015, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $2,718 $1,374 $408 $811 $125 Surety bonds 425 420 2 3 — Guarantees 678 21 14 130 513 Total commitments $3,821 $1,815 $424 $944 $638 (a) Approximately $1.1 billion of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $93 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $724 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. At December 31, 2015, third-party guarantees totaled $678 million, of which approximately 79% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a 55 Table of Contents venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2015, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under a services accounting model. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments contracted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 43%, 40%, and 45% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive-fee contracts, which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 54%, 55%, and 50% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 3% of our total net sales in 2015 and 5% of our total net sales in 2014 and 2013, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Percentage-of-Completion Method We record net sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services contracts with the U.S. Government. 56 Table of Contents The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. 57 Table of Contents Services Method Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Overview Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see Note 11). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits. The freeze will take effect in two stages. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 will not be used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. 58 Table of Contents Actuarial Assumptions The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, employee turnover, participant longevity, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We utilized a discount rate of 4.375% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2015, compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2014 and 4.75% at December 31, 2013. We utilized a discount rate of 4.25% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical plans at December 31, 2015, compared to 3.75% at December 31, 2014 and 4.50% at December 31, 2013. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% at December 31, 2015, consistent with the rate used at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $11.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates from 6.375% at the end of 2007 to 4.375% at the end of 2015 and investment losses incurred during 2008 and 2015, which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately 10 years as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, $850 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $693 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2016. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.375% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2015, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2015 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.375% discount rate at December 31, 2015 that was used to compute the expected 2016 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2016 would be lower or higher by approximately $120 million. If the 8.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2015 that was used to compute the expected 2016 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2016 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Funding Considerations We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.0 billion in 2014 and $2.25 billion in 2013 inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. We made $5 million in contributions to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2015. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. This ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. In 59 Table of Contents July 2012, the U.S. Government passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirements under the PPA. As a result of MAP-21 there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirements. The impact of MAP-21 decreased each year and was scheduled to phase out by 2016. On August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) was enacted; and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015; which extend the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in 2021 and phase out by 2024. This has the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise would have been had the legislation not been enacted. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 90% and 92% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 73% and 76% funded at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $1.6 billion in 2015 and $1.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013 as CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that will be phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. We expect the incremental impact of CAS Harmonization will increase successively through 2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2015, our prepayment credits were approximately $9.0 billion as compared to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The prepayment balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets. Trends We do not plan to make contributions to our heritage pension plans in 2016 or 2017 because none are required using current assumptions, including anticipated investment returns on plan assets. However, we do plan to make contributions of approximately $25 million in 2016 and about $35 million in 2017 to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan. We anticipate recovering approximately $2.0 billion of CAS pension cost in 2016 with a higher CAS recovery projected in 2017. Since the annual amount of CAS cost is more than our planned cash funding in each of these years, we will recover a portion of the $9.0 billion of prepayment credits existing at December 31, 2015. We expect our 2016 FAS pension expense to be $1.0 billion, which is comparable to our 2015 FAS pension expense of $1.1 billion. Also, we expect FAS/CAS pension income in 2016 of about $975 million, as compared to FAS/CAS pension income of $471 million in 2015, primarily due to higher CAS pension costs due to CAS Harmonization. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $1.0 billion and $965 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $858 million and $836 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. Our acquisition of Sikorsky included certain environmental remediation liabilities that are among those recorded on our Balance Sheet, along with the related receivables for probable future recovery. These amounts did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving governmental environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). On July 1, 2014, a regulation became effective in California setting the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water at 10 parts per billion (ppb). In May 2014, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association filed a suit alleging the 10 ppb threshold is lower than is required to protect public health and thus imposes unjustified costs on the regulated community. We cannot predict the outcome of this suit or whether other challenges may be advanced by the regulated community or environmental groups which had sought a significantly higher and lower standard, respectively. If the new standard remains at 10 ppb, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. In addition, California is reevaluating its existing drinking water standard with respect to a second contaminant, perchlorate, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is also considering whether to regulate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium in drinking water. In February 2016, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed suit in federal court in New York against the U.S. EPA to compel the U.S. EPA to set an enforceable drinking water standard for perchlorate. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level, for perchlorate or, if the U.S. EPA were to adopt a standard for hexavalent chromium lower than 10 ppb, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period. 61 Table of Contents If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Our goodwill balances were $13.6 billion and $10.9 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2015, our goodwill balance increased $2.7 billion, primarily as a result of $2.8 billion in preliminary goodwill recorded in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. Under the qualitative approach for selected reporting units we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test. For certain reporting units we only perform a quantitative impairment test. Under step one of the quantitative two step impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform step two of the quantitative impairment test and compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any assumed intangible assets that may not have any corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. 62 Table of Contents The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. Corporate allocations include our postretirement benefit plans liabilities, as determined in accordance with CAS, in order to align the basis of the carrying values with the determination of the fair values of our reporting units, which are measured using CAS pension cost. CAS pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, affects the fair value of each reporting unit. The amount of CAS pension liability allocated to each reporting unit is significantly influenced by a number of factors, including the discount rate used to estimate the obligation. On August 8, 2014, the HATFA, and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was enacted, which extended the pension interest rate relief of the prior MAP-21. As a result, the interest rate used to calculate CAS pension costs recovered under our contracts with the U.S. Government increased with the resulting effect of decreasing the amount of CAS pension liability allocated to each reporting unit, contributing to an increase in the carrying value of each reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. In connection with our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment, goodwill was reallocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed goodwill impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment. The results of our 2015 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of these tests indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, with the exception of our Technical Services reporting unit within our IS&GS business segment. Technical Services, for which we recorded a $195 million goodwill impairment in 2013, experienced further declines in fair value during 2014. Technical Services which typically has smaller customer contracts of a shorter duration, has been adversely impacted by market pressures such as lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. As a result, we compared the implied value of that reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill, and since the carrying value exceeded the implied value, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 equal to that differential. As a result of the 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, our Civil reporting unit was considered at risk of future goodwill impairment due to market factors and because the fair value of the Civil reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 15%. The results of our 2015 annual goodwill impairment test indicated that our Civil reporting unit’s fair value was no longer considered at risk of future goodwill impairment due to an increase in assessed fair value. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Intangible Assets Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to twenty years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard that will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard to 2018 for public companies, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard in 2017. Early adoption prior to 2017 is not permitted. The new standard may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis whereby the new standard would be applied to new contracts and existing contracts with remaining performance obligations as of the effective date, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings at the effective date for existing contracts with remaining performance 63 Table of Contents obligations. In addition, the FASB is contemplating making additional changes to certain elements of the new standard. We are currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As the new standard will supersede substantially all existing revenue guidance affecting us under GAAP, it could impact revenue and cost recognition on thousands of contracts across all our business segments, in addition to our business processes and our information technology systems. As a result, our evaluation of the effect of the new standard will extend over future periods. In September 2015, the FASB issued a new standard that simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to preliminary amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Instead, adjustments will be recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2016 and will prospectively apply the standard to business combination adjustments identified after the date of adoption. In November 2015, the FASB issued a new standard that simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets. The standard is effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The standard may be applied either prospectively from the date of adoption or retrospectively to all prior periods presented. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the standard and the method of adoption. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and the outstanding principal amount was $16.2 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs of $1.0 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2015. We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4.1 billion and $804 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not 64 Table of Contents material (Note 15). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2015 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2015, investments in the trust totaled $1.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our Balance Sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our Statements of Earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2015. 65 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:34.481334
936468,LMT,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP,2017,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Business Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2016, 71% of our $47.2 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 59% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 27% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash flow1 to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We expect 2017 net sales will increase in the mid-single digit range from 2016 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and sustainment volume on the F-35 program at Aeronautics as well as increased volume at MFC and RMS, partially offset by decreased volume at Space Systems. Operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels primarily driven by higher volume on the F-35 program, which is dilutive to our overall profit margin, contract mix at MFC, lower AWE Management Limited (AWE) earnings as a result of the non-cash gain recognized in 2016 related the consolidation of AWE, amortization of AWE intangible assets in 2017 and lower equity earnings at Space Systems. Accordingly, we expect 2017 segment operating profit margin will decline from our 2016 margin to just above 10%. Our outlook for 2017 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2017 budget. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2017 net sales and operating profit margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below. We expect the 2017 FAS/CAS pension adjustment to be approximately $880 million, which incorporates a year end 2016 discount rate of 4.125%, a 25 basis point decrease from the end of 2015; an actual investment return during 2016 of approximately 5.0%; a 50 basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption from 8.00% to 7.50%; and the revised longevity assumptions released on October 20, 2016 by the Society of Actuaries. We do not expect to make contributions to our legacy qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017. Portfolio Shaping Activities We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments. 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Business Developments Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation On November 6, 2015, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2015 by and between us and United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of UTC, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) for $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. Sikorsky, a global company primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, service and support of military and commercial helicopters, has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, aligned under the RMS business segment. We funded the acquisition with new debt issuances, commercial paper and cash on hand. We and UTC made a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, which treats the transaction as an asset purchase for tax purposes. Calculated using the Federal Statutory income tax rate, this election generates a cash tax benefit with an estimated net present value at the date of acquisition of $1.9 billion for us and our stockholders. The 2015 financial results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s operations. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the debt we incurred in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition. Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business On August 16, 2016, we completed the previously announced divestiture of the IS&GS business, which merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS business to Abacus Innovations Corporation (Abacus), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common stock of Abacus was distributed to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed Martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of Abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of Abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of the Transaction and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations, both the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion. The net gain represents the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments, which we expect to complete in 2017. We classified the operating results of the IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash flows generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the Transaction. Other On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE venture increased by 18% in exchange for our assuming a more significant role in managing the operations of the venture. As a result of the increase, we now own a 51% interest in AWE 28 Table of Contents and control its operations and board of directors. Accordingly, we are required to consolidate AWE, which has been aligned under our Space Systems business segment since August 24, 2016. Space Systems’ operating results include 100% of AWE’s net sales and 51% of AWE’s operating profit. Previously, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, none of AWE’s net sales and only 33% of AWE’s net earnings were included in operating profit of the Space Systems business segment. Additionally, we paid $898 million during 2014 for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the following acquisitions: • Systems Made Simple – a provider of health information technology solutions, which was included in our divesture of the IS&GS business; • Zeta Associates, Inc. – a designer of systems that enable collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of information for intelligence and defense communities, which is included in our Space Systems business segment; and • Industrial Defender – a provider of cybersecurity solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries, which was included in our divesture of the IS&GS business. For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Funding Constraints The U.S. Government has not yet passed an annual budget for Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2017. Accordingly, the U.S. Government is currently operating under a continuing resolution funding measure through April 28, 2017. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for fiscal year 2016 are available, subject to certain restrictions, however, new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions, or until regular annual appropriation bills are passed, we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding and those delays may affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During 2016, President Obama’s Administration and both houses of Congress proposed budget plans for GFY 2017 that were broadly divergent in how they would be implemented, but set overall national defense spending limits at amounts consistent with the current limit imposed by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budgets’ funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DoD-based budget. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. A substantial delay would require an extension of the continuing resolution to enable continuation of government operations beyond April 28, 2017. While we think it is unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full 2017 fiscal year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year continuing resolution, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years, or we could face a government shutdown of unknown duration. We anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over defense spending for GFY 2017 and beyond. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that existing cuts to government programs could be kept in place, replaced with different spending cuts, and/or replaced with a package of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products and services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources. International Business A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments. In our Aeronautics business segment, there continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and three international customers, 29 Table of Contents as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. For example, Denmark formally committed in 2016 to 27 F-35A variant aircraft. Japan received its first F-35A variant and two F-35A variant aircraft arrived in Israel. Additionally in 2016, Aeronautics received an undefinitized contract modification to the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 10 advance acquisition contract, which included 35 international orders. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics received a contract in 2016 with Korea for F-16 upgrades, extending work beyond 2020. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to draw interest from various international customers, including contracts in 2016 from France and Israel. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. During 2016, we received orders for PAC-3 systems from Qatar, the Republic of Korea, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. UAE is an international customer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products. In 2016, Poland became the first international customer for the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), a long range, conventional air-to-ground, precision-guided standoff missile. Other MFC international customers include Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan and Kuwait. In our RMS business segment, we continue to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, ship integration and test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea and Australia. We have an ongoing program in Canada for combat systems equipment upgrades on 12 Halifax-class frigates. In 2016, we were designated as the combat systems integrator for Australia’s Future Submarine program. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore and Australia. Our acquisition of Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the RMS business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production and sustainment support of the S-70i Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets in over 30 countries, and VIP customers. Our Space Systems business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space Systems has international contracts with Saudi Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of development contracts, production contracts and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the System Development and Demonstration portion of the development contracts will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. On November 2, 2016, the U.S. Government unilaterally issued a contract (referred to as LRIP 9) to purchase 57 F-35 aircraft, including 42 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant (F-35A) aircraft at a production price that is 5.5% less than the production price for the F-35A variant in its previous contract to acquire F-35 aircraft (referred to as LRIP 8). The unilateral contract action obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. At the time of the U.S. Government’s decision to issue the unilateral contract, the parties had reached agreement in principle on 30 Table of Contents certain terms and conditions of the contract. However, certain key terms remained under negotiation, including the amount of cost to perform the contract, price and payment terms. We will continue to execute on the F-35 program and are evaluating our options and path forward. Although the amount at issue on the LRIP 9 contract is not a significant percentage of the overall contract value, the unilateral contract action could negatively affect profit and cash flows on the LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 (which remains undefinitized) contracts, and establish a precedent for future F-35 production contracts. There is also uncertainty regarding actions that may be taken by the new Presidential Administration in light of recent criticisms of the F-35 program. President Trump has publicly expressed concerns over past cost overruns and delays in the program as well as overall program cost and has publicly requested that a competitor price out an alternative. Defense Secretary Mattis recently ordered a review of the program, including a comparison review of the F-35C carrier variant with a fourth generation alternative. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer has had discussions with President Trump on the importance of the F-35 program and our commitment to cut costs. However, we may continue to face pressure to reduce costs from the new Presidential Administration relating to the F-35 program and ongoing contract negotiations. Operationally, the U.S. Government continues to complete various tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations and weapons testing, and the F-35 aircraft fleet recently surpassed 80,000 flight hours. Progress also continues on the production of aircraft. In 2016, the program achieved a major milestone when the U.S. Air Force declared the F-35A variant ready for combat (also referred to as Initial Operating Capability (IOC)). The program continues to advance towards the U.S. Navy declaring the F-35C carrier variant ready for combat in 2018, as demonstrated by completing final carrier tests aboard the USS George Washington in 2016. Additionally, in 2016 we had initial deliveries of F-35 aircraft to Israel and Japan. As of December 31, 2016, we have delivered 200 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners including delivery of the first F-35 aircraft completed at the Italian Final Assembly and Check-Out Facility, and we have 173 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners. During aircraft inspections in 2016, debris was found in the fuel tank of an F-35A variant aircraft. It was determined the debris was caused by insulation shedding from tubing that is part of the system that provides cooling for the electronics and avionics and is located within the wing. Engineering assessments determined the tube assembly was wrapped using non-compliant insulation material. The non-compliant insulation was confined to only the F-35A variant aircraft. This issue affected 15 delivered aircraft and 42 aircraft in the factory. During the fourth quarter of 2016, modification work was completed to correct the issue on the 15 operational aircraft and flight operations have resumed. The issue was also corrected on many of the aircraft in the factory prior to delivery. The remaining affected aircraft will be corrected and delivered in 2017. This issue did not have a significant impact on our operating results or cash flows. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the aircraft. Consolidated Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. 31 Table of Contents Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 47,248 $ 40,536 $ 39,946 Cost of sales (42,186 ) (36,044 ) (35,263) Gross profit 5,062 4,492 4,683 Other income, net 487 220 329 Operating profit (a) 5,549 4,712 5,012 Interest expense (663 ) (443 ) (340) Other non-operating income, net — 30 5 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 4,886 4,299 4,677 Income tax expense (1,133 ) (1,173 ) (1,424) Net earnings from continuing operations 3,753 3,126 3,253 Net earnings from discontinued operations 1,549 479 361 Net earnings $ 5,302 $ 3,605 $ 3,614 Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $ 12.38 $ 9.93 $ 10.09 Discontinued operations 5.11 1.53 1.12 Total diluted earnings per common share $ 17.49 $ 11.46 $ 11.21 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating profit includes $45 million of operating loss at Sikorsky, which is less than 1% of consolidated operating profit in 2015. Sikorsky’s operating loss is net of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations. Net Sales We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Product sales are predominantly generated in each of our business segments and most of our service sales are generated in our RMS and Aeronautics business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Products $ 40,365 $ 34,868 $ 34,984 % of total net sales 85.4 % 86.0 % 87.6% Services 6,883 5,668 4,962 % of total net sales 14.6 % 14.0 % 12.4% Total net sales $ 47,248 $ 40,536 $ 39,946 Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method. Product Sales Product sales increased $5.5 billion, or 16%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $3.7 billion at RMS and approximately $1.8 billion at Aeronautics. The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales for training and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and the C-130 program due to increased aircraft deliveries. 32 Table of Contents Product sales decreased $116 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Lower product sales of about $290 million at Space Systems and approximately $250 million at MFC were partially offset by higher product sales of about $300 million at RMS and approximately $120 million at Aeronautics. The decrease in product sales at Space Systems was attributable to lower volume for government satellite programs (primarily Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF). Product sales at MFC decreased due to lower volume on air and missile defense systems programs (primarily PAC-3). The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to product sales from Sikorsky, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. Product sales at Aeronautics increased primarily due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts, as well as increased deliveries on our C-5 program; partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries for our C-130 and F-16 programs and lower sustainment activities on our F-22 program. Service Sales Service sales increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $700 million at RMS and approximately $360 million at Aeronautics. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs). Service sales increased $706 million, or 14%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to higher service sales of approximately $530 million at Aeronautics and about $190 million at Space Systems. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 program). The increase in service sales at Space Systems was primarily due to service sales of entities acquired in the third quarter of 2014. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Cost of sales – products $ (36,616 ) $ (31,091 ) $ (30,983) % of product sales 90.7 % 89.2 % 88.6% Cost of sales – services (6,040 ) (4,824 ) (4,184) % of service sales 87.8 % 85.1 % 84.3% Severance charges (80 ) (82 ) — Other unallocated, net 550 (47 ) (96) Total cost of sales $ (42,186 ) $ (36,044 ) $ (35,263) Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. Product Costs Product costs increased approximately $5.5 billion, or 18%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $3.6 billion at RMS and about $1.6 billion at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to product costs generated by Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased volume on aircraft production for the F-35 program and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-130 program. Product costs increased approximately $108 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Increased product costs of approximately $445 million at RMS and about $180 million at Aeronautics, were offset by decreases in product costs of approximately $325 million at Space Systems and $195 million at MFC. Increases in product costs at RMS were due primarily to the Sikorsky acquisition, including costs of Sikorsky products, intangible amortization and adjustments required 33 Table of Contents to account for the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were attributable to the reasons stated above for higher product sales, as well as decreased risk retirements (primarily F-22). The changes in product costs at Space Systems and MFC were attributable to the reasons stated above for higher product sales. Service Costs Service costs increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 25%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased service costs of about $670 million at RMS and approximately $400 million at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to service costs generated by Sikorsky, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and the F-22 programs). Service costs increased approximately $640 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Higher service costs of approximately $450 million at Aeronautics and about $230 million at Space Systems were due to the reasons stated above for higher service sales. These increases in service costs were partially offset by a decrease in service costs of about $80 million at MFC due primarily to lower service costs on various air and missile defense programs. Restructuring Charges 2016 Actions During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. During 2016, we paid $70 million in severance payments associated with these actions. 2015 Actions During 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. During 2016, we paid $64 million in severance payments associated with these actions. In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016 related to these actions. We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations. Other Unallocated, Net Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the Business Segment Results of Operations section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was $550 million of income in 2016, compared to expense of $47 million in 2015 and $96 million in 2014. The fluctuation between each respective period was primarily attributable to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $902 million in 2016, $400 million in 2015 and $317 million in 2014, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The changes in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment between the periods was primarily attributable to the increase in U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical Accounting Policies –Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost. As a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business, we retained all assets and obligations related to pension benefits earned by current and former IS&GS business salaried employees through the closing of the Transaction. Pension costs were 34 Table of Contents historically allocated to and included in the results of operations of the IS&GS business. In connection with the reclassification of the IS&GS business as discontinued operations, we reclassified the non-service portion of net pension costs related to IS&GS business salaried employee benefits (interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) from cost of sales (and previously reported in the IS&GS business’ operating profit) to other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings as corporate expenses because these costs will continue to be incurred by us subsequent to the Transaction. The service portion of net pension costs related to IS&GS business salaried employees that transferred to Leidos continued to be included in the operating results of the IS&GS business classified as discontinued operations because such costs will no longer be incurred by us subsequent to the Transaction. These net pension costs were $54 million, $71 million and $59 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In connection with the divestiture of the IS&GS business and reclassification of the IS&GS business to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, certain corporate overhead costs incurred by us and previously allocated to the IS&GS business were reclassified from the IS&GS business results (which is recorded in net earnings from discontinued operations) to other unallocated, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. These overhead costs related to expenses for senior management, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, tax, information technology, communications, ethics and compliance, corporate employee benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation, shared services processing and administration and depreciation for corporate fixed assets, and were not directly attributable to the IS&GS business. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we reclassified $82 million, $165 million and $169 million of corporate overhead costs to other unallocated, net. We allocate certain corporate overhead costs and defined benefit pension costs to our business segments because under U.S. Government contracting regulations such costs are allowable in establishing prices for contracts with the U.S. Government. Although the corporate overhead costs and defined benefit pension costs that were historically allocated to and included in the operating results of the IS&GS business have been reclassified to and included in the results of our continuing operations for financial reporting purposes, we will allocate similar costs incurred in future periods to our remaining business segments and expect to recover a substantial amount of these costs through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods. Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. Other income, net in 2016 was $487 million, compared to $220 million in 2015 and $329 million in 2014. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily attributable to the non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in AWE and approximately $120 million of increased earnings generated by equity method investees as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Additionally, in 2015 we incurred a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business. The decrease in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business and non-recoverable transaction costs of approximately $38 million associated with the Sikorsky acquisition, partially offset by fluctuations in other various costs, none of which were individually significant. The asset impairment charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit related to LMCFT of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. Earnings from equity method investees in 2015 were comparable to 2014 (reflecting decreased earnings from equity method investees in our Space Systems business segment, offset by increased earnings from Sikorsky equity method investees). Interest Expense Interest expense in 2016 was $663 million, compared to $443 million in 2015 and $340 million in 2014. The increases in interest expense in 2016 and 2015 relate to debt we incurred to fund the acquisition of Sikorsky, and the issuance of notes in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net decreased $30 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015 which did not recur in 2016. Other non-operating income, net increased $25 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015. 35 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 23.2% for 2016, 27.3% for 2015, and 30.4% for 2014. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The U.S. manufacturing deduction benefit for 2016, 2015, and 2014 reduced our effective tax rate by 2.4, 2.9, and 2.6 percentage points, respectively. The rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE. In addition, the rate for 2016 benefited from the additional tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during the second quarter of 2016. As a result, we are required to report the impacts as though the accounting standard update had been adopted on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $152 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 3.1 percentage points. The adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes second, third, and fourth quarter impacts and the reclassification of income tax benefits of $104 million originally recognized in additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2016. In 2016, the R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. In December 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended and reinstated, retroactive to the beginning of 2015, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. In 2014, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for one year, retroactive to the beginning of 2014, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.9 percentage point. As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business in 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2015. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and our deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $6.6 billion and $6.1 billion, based on a 35% the Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If legislation reducing the Federal statutory income tax rate to 15% had been enacted at December 31, 2016, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $3.8 billion and we would have recorded a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $3.8 billion. This additional expense would be less if the legislation phased in the tax rate reduction or if the final rate was higher than 15%. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $3.8 billion ($12.38 per share) in 2016, $3.1 billion ($9.93 per share) in 2015 and $3.3 billion ($10.09 per share) in 2014. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 14 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 and approximately 11 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 as a result of share repurchases and the completion of the exchange offer, which were partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations We reported net earnings from discontinued operations of $1.5 billion ($5.11 per share) in 2016, $479 million ($1.53 per share) in 2015 and $361 million ($1.12 per share) in 2014. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business. Net Earnings We reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($17.49 per share) in 2016, $3.6 billion ($11.46 per share) in 2015 and $3.6 billion ($11.21 per share) in 2014. 36 Table of Contents Business Segment Results of Operations We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. The amounts, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the results of the acquired Sikorsky business from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date. Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is part of our Space Systems business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); gains or losses from divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2016, 2015 and 2014, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension adjustment. The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for all years presented. 37 Table of Contents Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales Aeronautics $ 17,769 $ 15,570 $ 14,920 Missiles and Fire Control 6,608 6,770 7,092 Rotary and Mission Systems 13,462 9,091 8,732 Space Systems 9,409 9,105 9,202 Total net sales $ 47,248 $ 40,536 $ 39,946 Operating profit Aeronautics $ 1,887 $ 1,681 $ 1,649 Missiles and Fire Control 1,018 1,282 1,344 Rotary and Mission Systems 906 844 936 Space Systems 1,289 1,171 1,187 Total business segment operating profit 5,100 4,978 5,116 Unallocated items FAS/CAS pension adjustment FAS pension expense (a) (1,019 ) (1,127 ) (1,099) Less: CAS pension cost (a)(b) 1,921 1,527 1,416 FAS/CAS pension adjustment (c) 902 400 317 Severance charges (a)(d) (80 ) (82 ) — Stock-based compensation (149 ) (133 ) (154) Other, net (e)(f) (224 ) (451 ) (267) Total unallocated, net 449 (266 ) (104) Total consolidated operating profit $ 5,549 $ 4,712 $ 5,012 (a) FAS pension expense, CAS pension costs and severance charges reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees (see “Note 11 – Postretirement Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). (b) The higher CAS pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. (c) We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2017 of about $880 million (see “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below). (d) See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit. (e) Other, net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million related to our decision to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million. (f) Other, net in 2015 includes approximately $38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky. The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $96.2 billion, $94.8 billion and $74.5 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 excludes approximately $4.8 billion and $6.0 billion of backlog related to our IS&GS business, which we divested in 2016. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $66.0 billion at December 31, 2016. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for 38 Table of Contents a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. We have a contract to provide an integrated air and missile defense command, control, communications, computers –Integrated Surveillance & Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system to an international customer. In the first quarter of 2015, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues and recorded a reserve of 39 Table of Contents $70 million. Since that time, we have continued to experience issues related to customer requirements and the implementation of this contract and have periodically accrued additional reserves. Consequently, we are continuing to monitor the scope, estimated costs, and viability of the program and the possibility of additional customer funding. It is possible that we may have to record additional loss reserves in future periods, which could be material to our operating results. However, we cannot make an estimate of the total expected costs at this time due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process. Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The decrease in our consolidated net adjustments in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our MFC and Space Systems business segments, partially offset by an increase at our RMS business segment. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our Space Systems and Aeronautics business segments, offset by a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our RMS and MFC business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $530 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS. The consolidated net adjustments for 2015 are inclusive of approximately $550 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space Systems. The consolidated net adjustments for 2014 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs at RMS and net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including JASSM and GMLRS) at MFC as described in the respective business segment’s results of operations below. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-5M Super Galaxy and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 17,769 $ 15,570 $ 14,920 Operating profit 1,887 1,681 1,649 Operating margin 10.6 % 10.8 % 11.1% Backlog at year-end $ 34,200 $ 31,800 $ 27,600 2016 compared to 2015 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2016 increased $2.2 billion, or 14%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.7 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities, partially offset by lower volume on development activities; and approximately $290 million for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2016 compared to 21 in 2015) and increased sustainment activities; and approximately $250 million for the F-16 program primarily due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the C-5 program due to decreased sustainment activities. Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2016 increased $206 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $195 million for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements; and by approximately $60 million for aircraft support and maintenance programs due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for the C-130 program due to contract mix and lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $20 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. 2015 compared to 2014 Aeronautics’ net sales in 2015 increased $650 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.4 billion for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities; and approximately $150 million for the C-5 program due to increased deliveries (nine aircraft 40 Table of Contents delivered in 2015 compared to seven delivered in 2014). The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $350 million for the C-130 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (21 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 24 delivered in 2014), lower sustainment activities and aircraft contract mix; approximately $200 million due to decreased volume and lower risk retirements on various programs; approximately $195 million for the F-16 program due to fewer deliveries (11 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 17 delivered in 2014); and approximately $190 million for the F-22 program as a result of decreased sustainment activities. Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2015 increased $32 million, or 2%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased by approximately $240 million for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume and risk retirements; and approximately $40 million for the C-5 program due to increased risk retirements. These increases were offset by lower operating profit of approximately $90 million for the F-22 program due to lower risk retirements; approximately $70 million for the C-130 program as a result of the reasons stated above for lower net sales; and approximately $80 million due to decreased volume and risk retirements on various programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. Backlog Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs. Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 and C-130 programs. Trends We expect Aeronautics’ 2017 net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range as compared to 2016 due to increased volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is expected to increase at a slightly lower percentage range, driven by the increased volume on the F-35 program, partially offset by contract mix that results in a slight decrease in operating margins between years. Missiles and Fire Control Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, Sniper®, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS). In 2016 we submitted a bid for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) contract, which is a competitive follow-on contract to SOF CLSS. We anticipate an award decision on the follow-on contract in mid-2017. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 6,608 $ 6,770 $ 7,092 Operating profit 1,018 1,282 1,344 Operating margin 15.4 % 18.9 % 19.0% Backlog at year-end $ 14,700 $ 15,500 $ 13,300 2016 compared to 2015 MFC’s net sales in 2016 decreased $162 million, or 2%, compared to 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $205 million for air and missile defense programs due to decreased volume (primarily THAAD); and lower net sales of approximately $95 million due to lower volume on various programs. These decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase for tactical missiles programs due to increased deliveries (primarily Hellfire); and approximately $70 million for fire control programs due to increased volume (SOF CLSS). MFC’s operating profit in 2016 decreased $264 million, or 21%, compared to 2015. Operating profit decreased approximately $145 million for air and missile defense programs due to lower risk retirements (PAC-3 and THAAD) and a reserve for a contractual matter; approximately $45 million for tactical missiles programs due to lower risk retirements (Javelin); and approximately $45 million for fire control programs due to lower risk retirements (Apache) and program mix. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $225 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. 41 Table of Contents 2015 compared to 2014 MFC’s net sales in 2015 decreased $322 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $345 million for air and missile defense programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily PAC-3) and lower volume (primarily THAAD); and approximately $85 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS)) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, partially offset by increased deliveries for Hellfire. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $55 million for energy solutions programs due to increased volume. MFC’s operating profit in 2015 decreased $62 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $100 million for fire control programs due primarily to lower risk retirements (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER); and approximately $65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily Hellfire and GMLRS) and fewer deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $75 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased risk retirements (primarily THAAD). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $60 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3, Hellfire, and JASSM. Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, LANTIRN/Sniper and certain tactical missile programs, partially offset by lower orders on THAAD. Trends We expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 as compared to 2016 driven primarily by our air and missile defense programs. Operating profit is expected to be flat or increase slightly. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels as a result of contract mix and fewer risk retirements in 2017 compared to 2016. Rotary and Mission Systems As previously described, on November 6, 2015, we acquired Sikorsky and aligned the Sikorsky business under our RMS business segment. The 2015 results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. As a result, our consolidated operating results and RMS business segment operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky operations. Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters, ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, Space Fence, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, TPQ-53 Radar System, CH-53K development helicopter, and VH-92A helicopter program. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 13,462 $ 9,091 $ 8,732 Operating profit 906 844 936 Operating margin 6.7 % 9.3 % 10.7% Backlog at year-end $ 28,400 $ 30,100 $ 13,300 2016 compared to 2015 RMS’ net sales in 2016 increased $4.4 billion, or 48%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $4.6 billion from Sikorsky, which was acquired on November 6, 2015. Net sales for 2015 include Sikorsky’s results subsequent to the acquisition date, net of certain revenue adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $70 million for training 42 Table of Contents and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our LMCFT business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date; and approximately $65 million for ship and aviation systems programs due to decreased volume on various programs. RMS’ operating profit in 2016 increased $62 million, or 7%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for training and logistics programs due primarily to the divestiture of our LMCFT business which generated operating losses through its May 2, 2016 divestiture date; about $60 million for our integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to investments made in connection with a next generation radar technology program awarded during 2015; and approximately $55 million for undersea systems programs due primarily to higher reserves for performance matters on an international program in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $70 million as a result of a higher operating loss from Sikorsky, inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of intangible asset amortization and other adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business; about $30 million for ship and aviation systems programs due primarily to performance on various programs; and about $25 million for other matters. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $155 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. 2015 compared to 2014 RMS’ net sales in 2015 increased $359 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $400 million from Sikorsky, net of adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $220 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, primarily due to the ramp-up of recently awarded programs (Space Fence). These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $150 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume as a result of in-theater force reductions (primarily Persistent Threat Detection System); and approximately $105 million for ship and aviation systems programs primarily due to decreased volume (Merlin Capability Sustainment Program). RMS’ operating profit in 2015 decreased $92 million, or 10%, compared to 2014. Operating profit decreased by approximately $75 million due to performance matters on an international program; approximately $45 million for Sikorsky due primarily to intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $15 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, primarily due to investments made in connection with a recently awarded next generation radar technology program, partially offset by higher risk retirements (including Halifax Class Modernization). These decreases were partially offset by approximately $20 million in increased operating profit for training and logistics services programs, primarily due to reserves recorded on certain programs in 2014 that were not repeated in 2015. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014. Backlog Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to sales being recognized on several multi-year programs (primarily in Sikorsky) related to prior year awards. Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of Sikorsky’s backlog, as well as higher orders on new program starts (such as Australian Defence Force Pilot Training System). Trends We expect RMS’ 2017 net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to 2016. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percentage range due to a reduction in certain purchase accounting adjustments that were attributable to the Sikorsky acquisition, resulting in higher operating profit margins between years. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space Systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion, Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), AEHF, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), and The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space Systems business 43 Table of Contents segment includes AWE and our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales $ 9,409 $ 9,105 $ 9,202 Operating profit 1,289 1,171 1,187 Operating margin 13.7 % 12.9 % 12.9% Backlog at year-end $ 18,900 $ 17,400 $ 20,300 2016 compared to 2015 Space Systems’ net sales in 2016 increased $304 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $410 million from AWE following the consolidation of this business in the third quarter of 2016; and approximately $150 million for commercial space transportation programs due to increased launch-related activities; and approximately $70 million of higher net sales for various programs (primarily Fleet Ballistic Missiles) due to increased volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately $340 million for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs. Space Systems’ operating profit in 2016 increased $118 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash, pre-tax gain of approximately $127 million related to the consolidation of AWE; and approximately $80 million of increased equity earnings from joint ventures (primarily ULA). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $105 million for government satellite programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily SBIRS, MUOS and mission solutions programs) and decreased volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $185 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. 2015 compared to 2014 Space Systems’ net sales in 2015 decreased $97 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to approximately $335 million lower net sales for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily AEHF) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs; and approximately $55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $235 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $75 million for the Orion program due to increased volume. Space Systems’ operating profit in 2015 decreased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for government satellite programs due primarily to increased risk retirements. This increase was offset by lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for commercial satellite programs due to performance matters on certain programs; and approximately $35 million due to decreased equity earnings in joint ventures. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $105 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. Equity earnings Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems (primarily ULA) represented approximately $325 million, $245 million and $280 million, or 25%, 21% and 24% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Backlog Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of AWE’s backlog. Backlog decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs and the Orion program and higher sales on the Orion program. Trends We expect Space Systems’ 2017 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2016, driven by program lifecycles on government satellite programs, partially offset by the recognition of AWE net sales for a full year in 2017 versus a partial year in 2016 following the consolidation of AWE in the third quarter of 2016. Operating profit 44 Table of Contents is expected to decline in the low- to mid-double digit percentage range, primarily driven by sales volume, the one-time AWE non-cash gain in 2016, amortization of the AWE intangible assets in 2017, and lower equity earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. As a result operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels. Liquidity and Cash Flows We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates. We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2016. First, we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by 10% to $1.82 per share. Second, the Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. During 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases. We have accessed the capital markets opportunistically as we did in February 2015 when we issued $2.25 billion of long-term debt and as needed as we did in November 2015 when we issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Sikorsky. We also used a combination of short-term debt financing, commercial paper and available cash to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as discussed below in “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our revolving credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows. As described in the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below, we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, should they occur. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2016, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary. 45 Table of Contents The majority of our capital expenditures for 2016 and those planned for 2017 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 1,090 $ 1,446 $ 2,617 Operating activities Net earnings 5,302 3,605 3,614 Non-cash adjustments (35 ) 821 876 Changes in working capital (1,042 ) (846 ) (372) Other, net 964 1,521 (252) Net cash provided by operating activities 5,189 5,101 3,866 Net cash used for investing activities (985 ) (9,734 ) (1,723) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (3,457 ) 4,277 (3,314) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 747 (356 ) (1,171) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,837 $ 1,090 $ 1,446 Operating Activities 2016 compared to 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $88 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and an increase in cash used for working capital. The $196 million increase in cash flows used for working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to timing of cash receipts for receivables (primarily F-35 program), partially offset by timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). See “Critical Accounting Policies –Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under the caption “Funding Considerations”) for discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding. We made net income tax payments of $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We made interest payments of approximately $600 million and approximately $375 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we are at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. In 2014 and 2015, we received customer authorization and initial funding to begin producing F-35 aircraft to be acquired under LRIP 9 and 10 contracts, respectively. As a result of recent funding by the U.S. Government, our potential cash exposure and termination liability were not material at December 31, 2016. However, it may become material if government appropriations are delayed as was the case in the second and third quarters of 2016. 2015 compared to 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower pension contributions, partially offset by decreases in working capital and higher tax payments. The $1.8 billion increase in cash flows related to other, net in the table above is primarily because we made no contributions to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension trust in 2015 compared to $2.0 billion in 2014. We made $5.0 million in contributions to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2015. The increase in cash flows related to other, net was offset by higher federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, of approximately $210 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the absence of refunds received in 2015 (prior year’s tax refunds were attributable to timing of discretionary pension contributions made during the fourth quarter of the respective previous years). The $474 million decrease in cash flows related to working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable 46 Table of Contents and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to an increase in receivables due to timing of customer collections (primarily F-35 contracts) as well as timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities decreased $8.7 billion in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $9.0 billion of cash used for acquisition activities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Net cash used for investing activities increased $8.0 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to cash used for acquisition activities. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We had no acquisitions in 2016. In 2015 we paid $9.0 billion for the Sikorsky acquisition, net of cash acquired. In 2014, we paid $898 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisitions of Zeta, Systems Made Simple, and Industrial Defender (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Capital expenditures amounted to $1.1 billion in 2016, $939 million in 2015 and $845 million in 2014. The majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software. Additionally, in 2015, we received cash proceeds of approximately $165 million related to three properties sold in California. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities increased $7.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2015 which did not recur in 2016, the repayments of long-term debt in 2016, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the one-time special cash payment of $1.8 billion from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $7.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to proceeds from new debt issuances, partially offset by increased repurchases of common stock and higher dividends paid. In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In February 2015, we received net proceeds of $2.21 billion for the issuance of $2.25 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes. In November 2015, we borrowed $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes and received net proceeds of $6.9 billion (the November 2015 Notes). These proceeds were used to repay $6.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility that was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Sikorsky acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, to partially finance the Sikorsky acquisition we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0 billion under our commercial paper program. See the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our debt financing activities. We paid dividends totaling $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016, $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015 and $1.8 billion ($5.49 per share) in 2014. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. We declared quarterly dividends of $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; $1.50 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015; and $1.33 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2014 and $1.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014. We paid $2.1 billion, $3.1 billion and $1.9 billion to repurchase 8.9 million, 15.2 million and 11.5 million shares of our common stock during 2016, 2015 and 2014. 47 Table of Contents Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $106 million, $174 million and $308 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 1.2 million, 2.2 million and 3.7 million shares of our common stock. Capital Structure, Resources and Other At December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $400 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash had been repatriated at the end of 2016, we estimate that about $64 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits. Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. On occasion, customers may seek financing for the purchase of our products. In connection with these transactions, we may enter into arrangements along with our customers with unrelated third – party financial institutions to facilitate the non-recourse sale of customer receivables. For accounting purposes, these transactions are treated as a sale of receivables and the sale proceeds from the banks are reflected in our operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2016, there was no significant activity related to sales of customer receivables. Revolving Credit Facilities On October 9, 2015, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks. The 5-year Facility, was amended in October 2016 to extend its expiration date by one year from October 9, 2020 to October 9, 2021. The 5-year Facility is available for general corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the credit facility up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the 5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5-year Facility agreement. Long-Term Debt See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our long-term debt. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Commercial Paper We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion credit facility. During 2016, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows. 48 Table of Contents Total Equity Our total equity was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.5 billion from December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 9.4 million common shares tendered and retired in connection with the divestiture of our IS&GS business for $2.5 billion; the repurchase of 8.9 million common shares for $2.1 billion; and dividends declared of $2.0 billion during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $5.3 billion and employee stock activity of $399 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation). As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.7 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2016. Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2016, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 15,228 $ — $ 1,650 $ 2,150 $ 11,428 Interest payments 10,602 630 1,245 1,120 7,607 Other liabilities 2,923 268 531 417 1,707 Operating lease obligations 762 179 281 181 121 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 38,357 20,060 13,271 3,484 1,542 Capital expenditures 229 168 54 7 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 68,101 $ 21,305 $ 17,032 $ 7,359 $ 22,405 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture, for which the debt is not guaranteed by us. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2016. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $33 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties 49 Table of Contents (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2016, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $15 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2016 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2016, ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2016, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At December 31, 2016, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): Commitment Expiration By Period Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Standby letters of credit (a) $2,661 $1,232 $ 893 $363 $173 Surety bonds 368 366 — 2 — Third-party Guarantees 709 14 276 20 399 Total commitments $3,738 $1,612 $1,169 $385 $572 (a) Approximately $850 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category, $554 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $295 million in the “Years 4 and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. At December 31, 2016, third-party guarantees totaled $709 million, of which approximately 56% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2016, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under a services accounting model. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments contracted through the U.S. Government. Contract Types Our contracts generally record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 38%, 42%, and 41% of our total net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive-fee contracts, which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 61%, 57%, and 58% of our total net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Percentage-of-Completion Method We record net sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a 51 Table of Contents substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes. Services Method Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we 52 Table of Contents record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Overview Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see “Note 11 – Postretirement Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits. The freeze will take effect in two stages. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 will not be used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan. Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Actuarial Assumptions The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of 53 Table of Contents net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 4.125% at December 31, 2016, compared to 4.375% at December 31, 2015 and 4.00% at December 31, 2014. We utilized a weighted average discount rate of 4.00% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical plans at December 31, 2016, compared to 4.25% at December 31, 2015 and 3.75% at December 31, 2014. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 8.00% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We reduced our expected long-term rate of return assumption due to downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset classes in our trust. An increasingly aging population and debt burden place downward pressure on already low interest rates and economic growth; suggesting the future return for our fixed-income may be lower than historical norms. Surges in equities since 2009 have led to a high valuation of the equity markets, suggesting the forward return may also be lower than historical norms. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. On October 20, 2016, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies of longevity. We used the revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2016 remeasurement of benefit obligation. The publication was a refinement to the assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in October 2014 and October 2015 that we previously adopted beginning year 2014. Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $12.0 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2016. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. During 2016, $699 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $800 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2017. The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.125% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2016, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2016 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.125% discount rate at December 31, 2016 that was used to compute the expected 2017 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2017 would be lower or higher by approximately $120 million. If the 7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2016 that was used to compute the expected 2017 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2017 would be lower or higher by approximately $80 million. 54 Table of Contents Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2016 between our actual return of 5.0% and our expected long-term rate of return of 8.0% impacted 2017 FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million. Funding Considerations There were no contributions to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2016 and 2015. We made contributions related to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.0 billion in 2014 inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA. The ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. As a result of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirements under the PPA, there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirements. On August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) was enacted; and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015; which extend the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in 2021 and phase out by 2024. This has the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise would have been. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 87% and 90% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 70% and 73% at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.0 billion in 2016, $1.6 billion in 2015, and $1.5 billion in 2014 as CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that will be phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. We expect the incremental impact of CAS Harmonization will increase successively through 2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31, 2016, our prepayment credits were approximately $7.7 billion as compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The recovery of CAS pension costs under U.S. Government contracts in excess of our contributions reduces the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets. Trends We do not plan to make contributions to our heritage pension plans in 2017 because none are required using current assumptions, including investment returns on plan assets. However, we do plan to make contributions of approximately $45 million in 2017 to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan. Pension contributions to our heritage plans are expected to resume with contributions projected of about $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in 2018 using current assumptions including investment returns on plan assets. We anticipate recovering almost $2.3 billion of CAS pension cost in 2017 with a higher CAS recovery projected in 2018. Since the annual amount of CAS cost is more than our planned cash funding in each of these years, we will recover a portion of the $7.7 billion of prepayment credits existing at December 31, 2016. We expect our 2017 FAS pension expense to be $1.4 billion, as compared to our 2016 FAS pension expense of $1.0 billion, primarily due to the lower discount rate of 4.125% for 2017 versus 4.375% for 2016 and lower expected long- 55 Table of Contents term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at December 31, 2016 versus 8.00% at December 31, 2015. We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2017 of about $880 million, as compared to $902 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 FAS pension expense is mostly offset by higher 2017 CAS pension costs, as compared to 2016, due to CAS Harmonization. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $1.0 billion. We have recorded receivables totaling $870 million and $858 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving governmental environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). The current standard in California for the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). This standard is being challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) as being lower than is required to protect public health. If the standard remains at 10 ppb, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. The U.S. EPA is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium. In addition, California is reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding 56 Table of Contents environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Goodwill The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year. Under step one of the quantitative two step impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform step two of the quantitative impairment test and compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any assumed intangible assets that may not have any corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 57 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of our 2016 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed. The carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. Currently, we estimate that the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a margin of approximately 10%. We acquired Sikorsky in November 2015 and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. Due to the recent acquisition and valuation, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are currently closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancelations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our current assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky reporting unit is at risk of a future goodwill impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. In connection with our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment, goodwill was reallocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed goodwill impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment. The results of our 2015 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed. Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Intangible Assets Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no impairment existed. The carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes a trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2016. Using the relief from royalty method, we estimated that the fair value of this intangible asset approximated its carrying value. As discussed above in the Goodwill section, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are currently closely aligned due to the recent acquisition of Sikorsky. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancelations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales to decline below current projections. Based on our current assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky trademark intangible asset is at risk of a future impairment. 58 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” related to new accounting standards. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources. Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.0 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2016. We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2016 would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 59 Table of Contents We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2016, investments in the trust totaled $1.2 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016. 60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:49:40.255738
