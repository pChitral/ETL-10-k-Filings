109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2020,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to the Company’s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K. The Company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TJX undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 (fiscal 2020) and our 52-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019).The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Discussions of fiscal 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019.23OVERVIEWWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 4,500 stores and have four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2020 include the following:–Net sales increased to $41.7 billion for fiscal 2020, up 7% over fiscal 2019. At February 1, 2020, the number of stores in operation increased 5% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2019.–Comp sales increased 4% in fiscal 2020 over an increase of 6% in fiscal 2019. The fiscal 2020 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic at each of our four segments.–Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 were $2.67 compared to $2.43 per share in fiscal 2019. –Our fiscal 2020 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 10.6%, a 0.1 percentage point decrease compared to 10.7% in fiscal 2019.–Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2020 was 71.5% a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to 71.4% in fiscal 2019. –Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2020 was 17.9%, a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to 17.8% in fiscal 2019. –Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, increased 4% on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year.–During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 27.1 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion, on a “trade date basis”. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of our stock repurchase programs. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX common stock.Investment in FamiliaOn November 18, 2019, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, completed an investment of $225 million, excluding acquisition costs, for a 25% ownership stake in privately held Familia, an established, off-price apparel and home fashions retailer with more than 275 stores throughout Russia. The Company's investment represents a non-controlling, minority position. As part of this investment, TJX has the right to appoint and has appointed one member to the Board of Directors of Familia.This investment is included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting from the date of investment forward. TJX will report its share of Familia’s results on a one-quarter lag as their results are not expected to be available in time to be recorded in the concurrent period. As a result, there were no reported earnings from TJX's investment in Familia for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. Recent Events and TrendsCOVID-19In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) emerged and has subsequently spread worldwide. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. After close monitoring and taking into consideration the guidance from federal, state and local governments, in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, effective March 19, 2020, the Company closed all of its stores for at least two weeks and has temporarily closed its online businesses, its distribution centers and its offices with Associates working remotely where possible. The Company continues to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations at the federal, state and local level to evaluate possible extensions to all or part of such closures. We expect the cadence of store re-openings to vary by state and locality in the U.S., and by country. TJX has committed to pay its Associates until the week ending April 4, 2020 during these closures. The temporary closure of our stores is expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 24In addition, we have taken several steps to further strengthen our financial position and balance sheet, and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility, including suspending our share repurchase program, reviewing operating expenses, evaluating merchandise purchases, reducing capital expenditures and drawing down $1.0 billion on our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we do not intend to declare a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We continue to evaluate our dividend program in the near term, while we remain committed to paying our dividends whenever the environment normalizes for the long term. We also withdrew our first quarter and full year fiscal 2021 financial guidance given on our February 26, 2020 earnings conference call. The Company is not providing an updated outlook at this time.As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving, the Company's plans as described above may change. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Impact of BrexitOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and entered an 11-month transition period (the “Transition Period”), during which the UK continues to be treated as an EU member for most purposes. This Transition Period is due to end on December 31, 2020, and the UK and EU are currently negotiating the terms of their future relationship that will apply after this date.The terms of the future EU/UK trading relationship remain uncertain. Our TJX Europe management team has evaluated a range of possible outcomes, identified areas of concern, and implemented strategies to help mitigate them.We expect the future EU/UK trading relationship will subject the movement of goods between the UK and the EU to additional regulatory and compliance requirements, which is likely to have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise in the region. We have realigned our European division’s supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the UK and the EU and have established resources and systems to support this plan. There are also likely to be additional customs duty costs on EU/UK trade, the extent of which remain uncertain. Any customs duties may also impact the profitability of our European division, at least in the short term.New immigration requirements between the UK and EU countries may also have a negative impact on our ability to recruit and retain current and future talent in the region. We continue to communicate with our Associates about the new immigration requirements. In addition to these operational impacts, factors including changes in consumer confidence and behavior, economic conditions, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could result in a significant financial impact to our European operations, particularly in the short term. We believe the steps we have taken, and plan to take, will help us mitigate the effects when the Transition Period ends.TariffsThe U.S. Administration has imposed tariffs on imports from China. We continue to monitor the developments very closely and have started to see margin pressure based on the tariffs currently in place on the goods sourced directly from China. The impact on vendor and competitor pricing, consumer demand, potential tariff pass-throughs and the fluctuation of the Chinese currency remains uncertain.Net SalesNet sales for fiscal 2020 totaled $41.7 billion, a 7% increase over fiscal 2019. The increase reflected a 4% increase from comp stores and a 4% increase from non-comp sales. Foreign currency had a 1% negative impact in fiscal 2020. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2020 sales growth.Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 totaled $39.0 billion, a 9% increase over fiscal 2018. The increase reflected a 6% increase from comp stores and a 3% increase from non-comp sales. Foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2019. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2019 sales growth.25Revenues by GeographyThe percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last two fiscal years are as follows:Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019United States:Northeast23 %23 %Midwest13 %13 %South (including Puerto Rico)25 %25 %West15 %15 %Subtotal76 %76 %Canada10 %10 %Europe13 %13 %Australia1 %1 %Total100 %100 %Comparable Store SalesWe define comparable store sales (“comp sales”) to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculate comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation.Sales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consists of–New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales–Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time–Sales from our e-commerce sites, meaning sierra.com, tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com and tkmaxx.comWe determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 results, Sierra stores that otherwise fit the comp store definition are included in comp stores in our Marmaxx segment.Comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.Comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies.Comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2020 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. In fiscal 2020, home fashions and apparel both grew, with apparel outperforming home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., all regions reported solid comp sales increases with the Southwest and Southeast regions reporting the highest comp sales increases. In Canada, comp sales were below the consolidated average and TJX International was well above the consolidated average.Comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2019 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. In fiscal 2019, home fashions and apparel both grew, with apparel outperforming home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., the Southeast, Great Lakes and the Southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases, and the Mid Atlantic was below the consolidated average. Comp sales increases for TJX Canada and TJX International were below the consolidated average.26The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.

We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange”, also described below.Translational Foreign ExchangeIn our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.Mark-to-Market Inventory DerivativesWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.Transactional Foreign ExchangeWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy CostsCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.5% in fiscal 2020 compared to 71.4% in fiscal 2019. The increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2020 was driven by higher supply chain costs, partially offset by the expense leverage on the strong comp sales growth.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.9% in fiscal 2020 compared to 17.8% in fiscal 2019. The increase in this expense ratio reflects wage increases and incremental systems and technology costs, partially offset by the expense leverage on the strong comp sales growth, primarily advertising costs.27Pension Settlement ChargeDuring fiscal 2019, we annuitized and transferred current pension obligations for certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries under the qualified pension plan through the purchase of a group annuity contract with an insurance company. We transferred $207.4 million of pension plan assets to the insurance company, thereby reducing our pension benefit obligations. The transaction had no cash impact to TJX but did result in a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $36.1 million.Interest Expense, netThe components of interest expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019Interest expense$61.4 $69.1 Capitalized interest(2.3) (4.2) Interest (income)(49.1) (56.0) Interest expense, net$10.0 $8.9 The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower rates and lower capitalized interest on capital projects, partially offset by the elimination of build-to-suit accounting as a result of adopting the new lease accounting standard. For additional information, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income TaxesOur effective annual income tax rate was 25.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to 26.7% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in the fiscal 2020 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by fiscal 2019 including a charge related to the 2017 Tax Act that was not incurred in fiscal 2020 and change in the jurisdictional mix of income.Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareNet income was $3.3 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $3.1 billion in fiscal 2019. Diluted earnings per share were $2.67 in fiscal 2020 and $2.43 in fiscal 2019. The pension settlement charge had a $0.02 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019.Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in each fiscal year presented.Segment InformationWe operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and the HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods and Homesense) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.28U.S. SEGMENTSMarmaxx Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019Net sales$25,664.8 $24,058.0 Segment profit margin$3,469.8 $3,253.9 Segment profit margin as a percentage of net sales13.5 %13.5 %Increase in comp sales5 %7 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.J.

The sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2020 reflects a 5% increase from comp sales and a 2% increase from non-comp sales. The sales increase of 8% in fiscal 2019 reflects a 7% increase from comp sales and a 1% increase from non-comp sales. Sales of our U.S. e-commerce businesses represented approximately 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales in both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.Comp sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a 4% increase in customer traffic on top of a 5% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019. Geographically, comp sales were strongest in the Southwest and Southeast regions. Home fashions outperformed apparel in fiscal 2020 with both categories posting solid comp sales growth.Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin was 13.5% for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Merchandise margin slightly increased for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as favorable mark-on and lower markdowns were partially offset by increased freight costs and tariff pressures. Segment profit margin also reflects higher supply chain costs and wage increases. These were offset by the expense leverage on the strong 5% comp sales growth, store expense savings and lower incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2020. Our U.S. e-commerce businesses, including our newest e-commerce website www.marshalls.com, which was introduced during fiscal 2020, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment profit margin comparisons.29HomeGoods Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019Net sales$6,355.8 $5,787.4 Segment profit margin$680.5 $671.9 Segment profit margin as a percentage of net sales10.7 %11.6 %Increase in comp sales2 %4 %Stores in operation at end of period:HomeGoods809 749 Homesense32 16 Total841 765 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):HomeGoods14,831 13,775 Homesense685 343 Total15,516 14,118 Net SalesNet sales for HomeGoods increased 10% in fiscal 2020, on top of a 13% increase in fiscal 2019. The sales increase of 10% in fiscal 2020 reflects an 8% increase from non-comp sales and a 2% increase from comp sales. The sales increase of 13% in fiscal 2019 reflects a 9% increase from non-comp sales and a 4% increase from comp sales. Comp sales growth at HomeGoods for fiscal 2020 was due to a 2% increase in customer traffic on top of a 5% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019. Geographically, comp sales were strongest in the Southwest and Southeast regions. Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin decreased to 10.7% for fiscal 2020 compared to 11.6% for fiscal 2019. Merchandise margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily driven by favorable mark-on partially offset by increased tariff costs.The decrease in segment profit margin reflects the investment in store growth, higher supply chain costs, the expense deleverage on the 2% comp sales growth as well as wage increases. These collectively reduced segment profit margin by approximately 0.9 percentage points.30FOREIGN SEGMENTS TJX Canada Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019Net sales$4,031.4 $3,869.8 Segment profit margin$515.6 $551.6 Segment profit margin as a percentage of net sales12.8 %14.3 %Increase in comp sales2 %4 %Stores in operation at end of period:Winners279 271 HomeSense137 125 Marshalls97 88 Total513 484 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):Winners5,986 5,862 HomeSense2,511 2,323 Marshalls2,043 1,885 Total10,540 10,070 Net SalesNet sales for TJX Canada increased 4% in fiscal 2020, on top of a 6% increase in fiscal 2019.

The sales increase of 6% in fiscal 2019 reflects a 4% increase from comp sales, a 4% increase from non-comp sales, offset by a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Comp sales growth at TJX Canada for fiscal 2020 was driven by a 3% increase in customer traffic on top of a 5% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019.Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin decreased to 12.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2019. Merchandise margin decreased by approximately 0.7 percentage points. The decline in merchandise margin was due to the impact of transactional foreign exchange on the cost of merchandise and higher freight costs.The decrease in segment profit margin also reflects an unfavorable year-over-year comparison related to a lease buyout gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, higher supply chain costs, the expense deleverage on the 2% comp sales growth and wage increases.31TJX International Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019Net sales$5,665.0 $5,257.8 Segment profit margin$307.1 $285.8 Segment profit margin as a percentage of net sales5.4 %5.4 %Increase in comp sales8 %3 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.K.

The sales increase of 8% in fiscal 2019 reflects a 4% increase from non-comp sales, a 3% increase from comp sales and a 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. E-commerce sales represent 3% of TJX International’s net sales in both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.Comp sales growth at TJX International for fiscal 2020 was driven by a 7% increase in customer traffic on top of a 4% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019.Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin was 5.4% for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Merchandise margin decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The decline in merchandise margin was primarily driven by the impact of transactional foreign exchange on the cost of merchandise, partially offset by favorable markdowns.Segment profit margin also reflects the expense leverage on the strong 8% comp sales growth. This was partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2020, incremental systems and technology costs and wage increases.GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsFebruary 1,2020February 2,2019General corporate expense$556.7 $545.0 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs and stock compensation costs, offset by the favorable year-over-year comparison from the corporate IT restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2019.32ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 1, 2020, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding.As part of the actions we have taken relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above in Recent Events and Trends, on March 20, 2020, we drew down $1 billion on our revolving credit facilities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year, subject to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.As of February 1, 2020, TJX held $3.2 billion in cash. Approximately $1.0 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $584.7 million held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. TJX has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through February 1, 2020. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings.Operating cash flows for fiscal 2020 were essentially flat to fiscal 2019. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 by $0.3 billion. This was primarily offset by a decrease in cash flows attributable to a reduction in income taxes payable. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2019 increased by $1.1 billion compared to fiscal 2018. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 by $0.5 billion. In addition there was a $0.6 billion increase in cash flows related to prepaid expenses and other current assets largely due to the prefunding of certain service contracts in fiscal 2018.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2019. The cash outflows were primarily driven by capital expenditures and, in fiscal 2020, the Company invested $0.2 billion in Familia, an established off-price apparel and home fashion retail chain in Russia. In addition, the activity in fiscal 2019 reflects the liquidation of short-term investments by TJX Canada as a result of a repatriation of earnings during the year.Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below.

On November 18, 2019, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, completed an investment of $225 million, excluding acquisition costs, for a 25% ownership stake in privately held Familia, an established, off-price apparel and home fashions retailer with more than 275 stores throughout Russia. The Company's investment represents a non-controlling, minority position. As part of this investment, TJX has the right to appoint and has appointed one member to the Board of Directors of Familia.33In fiscal 2019 we purchased $0.2 billion of investments, and these cash outflows were more than offset by $0.6 billion of inflows related to investments that were sold or matured during fiscal 2019. This activity primarily related to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and are not classified as cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020 and $3.1 billion in fiscal 2019. These cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by issuances of common stock.EquityTJX repurchased and retired 27.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion during fiscal 2020, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.6 billion to repurchase 28.2 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2020 and $2.4 billion to repurchase 50.8 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2019.For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D—Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2020, TJX announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. In connection with the actions taken related to the COVID-19 pandemic as described in Recent Events and Trends, the Company suspended its share repurchase program. DividendsWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.92 per share in fiscal 2020 and $0.78 per share in fiscal 2019. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 and $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2019. The Company does not intend to declare a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is evaluating its dividend program in the near term, while it remains committed to paying dividends whenever the environment normalizes for the long term.Contractual Obligations As of February 1, 2020, we had known contractual obligations under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments), other long-term obligations, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows:Payments Due by PeriodIn millionsTotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsLong-term debt and other long-term obligations(a)$2,482.1 $55.6 $830.3 $551.2 $1,045.0 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest(b)10,218.0 1,781.2 3,179.4 2,428.8 2,828.6 Purchase obligations(c)3,799.7 3,652.0 140.5 7.2 — Total obligations$16,499.8 $5,488.8 $4,150.2 $2,987.2 $3,873.6 (a)Includes estimated interest costs.(b)Operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our Lease Accounting Policy. The balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2020. (c)Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be canceled without penalty.We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $514.8 million for employee compensation and benefits and $255.4 million for uncertain tax positions.34CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.Inventory ValuationWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Tradenames We evaluate our goodwill, tradenames and long-lived assets, inclusive of operating lease right of use assets, for indicators of impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets, operating lease right of use assets or tradenames has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. If we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and revenue growth for the related business unit. The fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount.Lease AccountingOperating leases are included in “Operating lease right of use assets”, “Current portion of operating lease liabilities”, and “Long-term operating lease liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. At the inception of the arrangement, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease based on assessment of the terms and conditions of the contract. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The majority of our leases are retail store locations and the possession date is typically 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store and generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease. Our lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at possession date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated based on the US Consumer Discretionary yield curve and adjusted for collateralization and foreign currency impact for TJX International and Canada leases. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any acquisition costs offset by lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term within “Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs”. 35Reserves for Uncertain Tax PositionsLike many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how corporations are taxed, requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we continue to interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.Loss ContingenciesCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements related to leases, internal use software, income taxes, and comprehensive income, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.36ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskTJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E—Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income by approximately $82 million and $84 million, in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISKThe assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I—Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:01.337455

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to our future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to us, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K. Our results are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TJX undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and February 1, 2020 (fiscal 2020). Our 52-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 is referred to as fiscal 2019 and our 52-week fiscal year ended January 29, 2022 is referred to as fiscal 2022.The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020.OVERVIEWWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 4,500 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.Impact of the COVID-19 PandemicAfter a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) emerged and spread worldwide, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, and national, state and local governments and private entities began issuing various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantine or isolation protocols. We temporarily closed all of our stores, online businesses, distribution centers and offices in March 2020, with Associates working remotely where possible. During April 2020, we temporarily furloughed the majority of hourly store and distribution center Associates in the U.S. and Canada, with employee benefits coverage for eligible Associates continuing during the temporary furlough at no cost to impacted Associates. We also took comparable actions with respect to portions of our European and Australian workforces.When we began to reopen stores and distribution centers in May 2020, we implemented new health and safety practices, including practices related to personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and social distancing protocols. Early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, in response to increasing cases of COVID-19, hundreds of our stores had additional temporary closures, the vast majority being in Europe and Canada, and additional stores may close temporarily in the future. We continue to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations at the national, state, and local level that could result in possible additional impacts to our operations.Our results for fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of our stores for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021 in the aggregate. This represents total store days closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a percentage of potential total store days open. See additional details below by segment.Fiscal 2021Marmaxx20 %HomeGoods20 TJX Canada29 TJX International 36 Total24 %25As of March 30, 2021, we had approximately 580 stores, primarily in Europe, that were temporarily closed due to government mandates in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We expect closures in Europe and Canada to impact our first quarter fiscal 2022 results as stores are expected to be closed for approximately 71% and 12% of the quarter, respectively. Although the majority of our Germany and Netherlands stores were reopened by the end of March, additional operating restrictions have been imposed, including appointment requirements, limited business hours and capacity constraints. In total, based on current restrictions, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 12% of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. All of our e-commerce businesses remain open, including tkmaxx.com in the U.K.In addition to the temporary closures and reopenings of our stores and other facilities, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to modifications to our operations, including the implementation of health and safety protocols, and has impacted consumer behavior. The continued scope and impact of the pandemic is unpredictable and has in the past caused, currently causes, and may continue to cause additional intermittent or prolonged periods of temporary store closures, and may result in additional changes in consumer demand and behavior or require further modifications to our operations. These potential impacts may lead to increased asset recovery and valuation risks, such as impairment of our stores and other assets and an inability to realize deferred tax assets due to sustaining losses in certain jurisdictions. The uncertainties in the global economy may also impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and service providers (including transportation and logistics providers), which may interrupt our supply chain, and require other changes to our operations. These and other factors have had and may continue to have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Store and Associate ActionsWe have taken numerous steps designed to protect the health and well-being of our Associates and customers to operate more safely in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We established several global task force teams focused on a broad range of strategies to navigate the Company through this global health crisis. Globally, we have put in place practices including social distancing protocols (which include occupancy limits and reducing in-store inventory levels), access to personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning efforts. For example, upon reopening our stores, we installed protective shields at registers, encouraged social distancing through regular in-store announcements, signage, and markers in our queue lines, implemented new processes for handling merchandise returns, and instituted new cleaning regimens, including enhanced cleaning of high-touch surfaces, such as shopping carts, throughout the day. Further, in many locations, including where mandated, we have required that shoppers wear a face covering in stores.Financial ActionsBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity The temporary closure of our stores had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. As further detailed below in Results of Operations, this impact included a 23% decrease in net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to the same period last year, resulting in a significant decline in net profit for the full fiscal year.During fiscal 2021, we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flows and ended the year with $10.5 billion of cash. In addition, we increased our borrowing capacity by entering into a $500 million 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility, making a total of $1.5 billion available to us under revolving credit facilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, TJX issued $4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes and accepted $1.1 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of certain of its notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 pursuant to cash tender offers. We paid $1.4 billion aggregate consideration (including transaction costs) and recorded a $0.3 billion pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes. For additional information on the new credit facility and debt transactions, see Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We intend to continue to be prudent with our expenses for fiscal 2022. Capital spending for fiscal 2022 is expected to be back in line with normal spending, and is expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion with incremental investments in our infrastructure and our distribution centers, both existing and new facilities. We are planning approximately 120 net store openings for fiscal 2022. We have currently suspended our share repurchase program. While our Board of Directors did not declare a dividend in the first nine months of fiscal 2021, we declared a dividend of $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, paid in March 2021. We also declared a similar dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2021, we negotiated rent deferrals (primarily for second quarter lease payments) for a significant number of our stores, with repayment at later dates, primarily in fiscal 2022. We elected to treat the COVID-19 pandemic-related rent deferrals as a resolution of a contingency by remeasuring the lease liability, with a corresponding offset to the right-of-use asset, using the remeasured consideration. In addition to negotiating deferral of lease payments, we had temporarily extended payment terms on merchandise orders, which increased our accounts payable as of the end of the fiscal year, benefiting our operating cash flows. As payment terms are reduced and we make deferred payments, we expect our operating cash flows to be negatively impacted.26We evaluated the value of our inventory in light of the temporary store closures in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Permanent markdowns, which had been or will be taken upon reopening of the stores, on transitional or out of season merchandise and merchandise that was already in markdown status, combined with the write-off of perishable goods, resulted in a reduction of approximately $0.4 billion in inventory for fiscal 2021. Additional markdowns recorded throughout the year were taken in the ordinary course of business operations.Given the substantial reduction in our sales and the reduced cash flow projections as a result of the temporary store closures during fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined that triggering events had occurred and that impairment assessments were warranted for certain stores. This resulted in impairment charges of $72 million for fiscal 2021, related to operating lease right of use assets and store fixed assets. Operating ExpensesWe incurred additional payroll costs associated with monitoring occupancy limits to comply with social distancing protocols and implementing enhanced cleaning regimens in our stores, distribution centers, and offices. In addition, we provided discretionary appreciation bonuses during fiscal 2021 to store and distribution center Associates and incurred incremental costs for personal protective equipment and additional cleaning supplies. We expect that many of these costs will continue in fiscal 2022. We have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, cost saving initiatives to reduce some ongoing variable and discretionary spending.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the U.S., U.K., Canada and various other jurisdictions have implemented programs to encourage companies to retain and pay employees who are unable to work or are limited in the work that they can perform in light of closures or a significant decline in sales. Throughout fiscal 2021 we continued to qualify for certain of these provisions, which partially offset related expenses. During fiscal 2021, these programs reduced our expenses by approximately $0.5 billion on our Consolidated Statements of Income. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSMatters Affecting ComparabilityAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our stores were closed in the aggregate for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021. In addition to lost revenues, we continued to pay wages and provide benefits to many of our Associates during the closures, and incurred incremental operating expenses upon reopening for new health and safety practices. This significantly impacted the operating results of all of our divisions and our expense ratios as compared to the prior year.Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2021 include the following:–Net sales decreased 23% to $32.1 billion for fiscal 2021, versus fiscal 2020 sales of $41.7 billion. As of January 30, 2021, the number of stores in operation (including stores that had been temporarily closed due to COVID-19) increased 1% and selling square footage increased 1% compared to the end of fiscal 2020.–Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $0.07 versus $2.67 per share in fiscal 2020.–Pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for fiscal 2021 was 0.3%, a 10.3 percentage point decrease compared with 10.6% in fiscal 2020. –The debt extinguishment charge of $0.3 billion reduced fiscal 2021 pre-tax margin by 1.0 percentage point and reduced earnings per share by $0.19 per share.–Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2021 was 76.3%, a 4.8 percentage point increase compared with 71.5% in fiscal 2020. –Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2021 was 21.8%, a 3.9 percentage point increase compared with 17.9% in fiscal 2020. –Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, were down 21% on a reported basis and down 22% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2021 as compared to a 4% increase in average per store inventories on both a reported and constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2020.–There were no dividends declared during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and share repurchases were suspended in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. A dividend of $0.26 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and paid in March of 2021. See the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic section above for the actions taken regarding our share repurchase programs.27Recent Events and TrendsCOVID-19See discussion above in the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic section.Impact of BrexitOn December 24, 2020 the U.K. and EU agreed upon the terms of their future trading relationship. As expected the movement of goods between the U.K. and EU is subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements, which is expected to have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise in the region. We have realigned our European division's supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the U.K. and the EU and have established resources and systems to support this plan. The new trade deal provides for zero customs duties and zero quotas on trade between the U.K. and the EU in goods that are produced in each of the U.K. and the EU. However, a proportion of the merchandise we source in the U.K. and the EU is produced somewhere else in the world, and therefore will be subject to additional customs duty costs under the new trade deal. These additional customs duties and the related operational costs are likely to impact the profitability of our European division, at least in the short term. New immigration requirements between the U.K. and EU countries may also have a negative impact on our ability to recruit and retain current and future talent in the region. We continue to communicate with our Associates about the new immigration requirements. In addition to these operational impacts, factors including changes in legislation, consumer confidence and behavior, economic conditions, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could result in a significant financial impact to our European operations, particularly in the short term.Net SalesNet sales for fiscal 2021 totaled $32.1 billion, a 23% decrease over fiscal 2020. The decrease in net sales was driven by temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower customer traffic, with stores closed in the aggregate for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 3% of total sales.As a result of the extended store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our policy relating to the treatment of extended store closures when calculating comp store sales under our historical definition, we had no stores classified as comp stores at the end of fiscal 2021. In order to provide a performance indicator for our stores as they reopened, since the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we have been temporarily reporting a new sales measure, open-only comp store sales. Open-only comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that have had to temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in the prior year. Open-only comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year using the prior year’s exchange rates. Our historical definition of comp store sales is presented below for reference.Open-only comp store sales were down 4% for fiscal 2021 as compared to last year. These results reflect a decrease in customer traffic, partially offset by an increased average basket across all divisions. Our stores were closed in the aggregate for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021. Home fashion across all major segments outperformed apparel for fiscal 2021.We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions. Historical Definition of Comp Store SalesWe are temporarily reporting a new sales measure, open-only comp store sales, as described above. The following reflects the way that we have historically classified and reported comp sales results.Historically, we defined comparable store sales, or comp sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculated comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.28Sales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consist of sales from:–New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales–Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time–Sales from our e-commerce sites, meaning sierra.com, tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com and tkmaxx.comWe determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. Beginning in fiscal 2020, Sierra stores that otherwise fit the comp store definition are included in comp stores in our Marmaxx segment.Comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales using the prior year’s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.Comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies.Operating Results as a Percentage of Net SalesThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.

We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange”, also described below.29Translation Foreign ExchangeIn our consolidated financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.Mark-to-Market Inventory DerivativesWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the mark-to-market gain or loss is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market gain or loss on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and net income.Transactional Foreign ExchangeWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy CostsCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was $24.5 billion, or 76.3% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $29.8 billion, or 71.5% of net sales for fiscal 2020. The main reason for the decrease in the total cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was the reduction in cost of merchandise sold due to a reduction in net sales as compared to the prior year, primarily due to our stores being temporarily closed in the aggregate for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021.The increase in the expense ratio of 4.8% for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of lower sales primarily as a result of temporary store closures. A significant portion of our occupancy costs are fixed and although we negotiated rent deferrals to help with our liquidity, our occupancy costs were comparable to last year but increased the expense ratio by approximately 2.1 percentage points due to the lower sales volume. Our distribution costs increased the expense ratio by approximately 1.6 percentage points due to processing more units while our merchandise mix had a lower average ticket. In addition, distribution costs reflect wage increases, discretionary appreciation bonuses, and incremental costs to implement and maintain health and safety protocols, despite a reduction in payroll costs due to Associate furloughs in the first half of fiscal 2021 and $78 million in benefits received from government programs available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and various other jurisdictions. Merchandise margin was negatively impacted by increased markdowns as a percentage of net sales, as well as increased freight costs partially offset by strong mark-on. The increased markdowns include those taken to revalue inventories due to our temporary store closures.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses were $7 billion, or 21.8% of net sales for fiscal 2021, compared to $7.5 billion, or 17.9% of net sales for fiscal 2020.The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by store payroll and store supply costs which negatively impacted the expense ratio by 2.7 percentage points. These costs were primarily COVID-related, including incremental store payroll investments to allow for enhanced cleaning and monitoring capacity, discretionary appreciation bonuses, and personal protective equipment for our Associates. These incremental costs were partially offset by expense savings, including lower advertising and travel spend, as well as other variable store costs such as credit processing fees, which were lower as a result of the temporary store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also paid certain Associates during the temporary store closures, which was partially offset by $434 million from government programs available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and various other jurisdictions. 30Loss On Early Extinguishment of DebtOn November 30, 2020 we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.150% notes due 2028 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.600% notes due 2031. We used the proceeds to partially fund the purchase, on December 4, 2020, of $365 million of our 4.500% notes due 2050 and $754 million of our 3.875% notes due 2030 that were tendered and accepted in our cash tender offer. We recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $312 million. For additional information on the debt transactions, see Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Interest Expense, netThe components of interest expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020Interest expense$199 $61 Capitalized interest(5)(2)Interest (income)(13)(49)Interest expense, net$181 $10 Net interest expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the issuance of additional debt in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower interest income. In addition, fiscal 2021 included interest expense on the $1 billion of borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, which were paid off in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was (1.4)% for fiscal 2021 compared to 25.7% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in the fiscal 2021 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our results and the change in the jurisdictional mix of income and losses.Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareNet income was $0.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $0.07 in fiscal 2021 and $2.67 in fiscal 2020. The loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced net income by $229 million, or $0.19 per share, for the twelve months ended January 30, 2021. Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, had no impact on our earnings per share in fiscal 2021 as we suspended the program in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our stock repurchase programs benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in fiscal 2020.Segment InformationWe operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and the HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods and Homesense) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.Due to the temporary closing of all of our stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our historical definition of comp store sales is not applicable for the reported periods. In order to provide a performance indicator for our stores as they reopen, since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we have been temporarily reporting a new sales measure, open-only comp store sales. Open-only comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that have had to temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in the prior year. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.31U.S. SEGMENTSMarmaxx Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$19,363 $25,665 Segment profit$891 $3,470 Segment margin4.6 %13.5 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.J.

Maxx27,707 27,781 Marshalls25,915 25,909 Sierra796 766 Total54,418 54,456 Net SalesNet sales for Marmaxx decreased 25% for fiscal 2021 as compared to last year. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the temporary closures of all stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The stores were closed for approximately 20% of fiscal 2021. In addition, the decrease in net sales was due to lower customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average basket. Open-only comp store sales were down 7% for fiscal 2021. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2021.Segment Profit Segment profit was $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion, compared to a segment profit of $3.5 billion for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in sales from the temporary store closures. This decrease reflects increased markdowns on merchandise primarily taken in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased freight costs, partially offset by stronger mark-on. In addition, segment profit declined as a result of our reduced buying activity and lower inventory levels resulting in higher buying and distribution costs in fiscal 2021 as compared to last year, and as a result of incremental COVID-19 costs. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by lower advertising and travel spend, a reduction in store payroll while the stores were closed and other variable store expense savings. The reduction in payroll reflects approximately $171 million for fiscal 2021 from government programs as described in the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. In addition, a significant portion of our occupancy costs are fixed. As a result, while our occupancy costs were comparable to last year, they negatively impacted segment margin by approximately 2.2 percentage points, primarily due to the lower sales volume.During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Marmaxx made online shopping available at www.marshalls.com, along with www.tjmaxx.com, which was launched previously. Our U.S. e-commerce businesses, which represented approximately 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. Along with our stores, we temporarily closed our online businesses for a portion of fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.32HomeGoods Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$6,096 $6,356 Segment profit$510 $681 Segment margin8.4 %10.7 %Stores in operation at end of period:HomeGoods821 809 Homesense34 32 Total855 841 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):HomeGoods15,034 14,831 Homesense733 685 Total15,767 15,516 Net SalesNet sales for HomeGoods decreased 4% for fiscal 2021 as compared to last year. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the temporary closures of all stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The stores were closed for approximately 20% of fiscal 2021. In addition, the decrease in net sales was due to lower customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average basket. Open-only comp store sales were up 13% for fiscal 2021.Segment Profit Segment profit was $510 million for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $171 million, compared to a segment profit of $681 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in sales due to temporary store closures and increased store and distribution payroll costs, including incremental COVID-19 costs. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by improved merchandise margin, lower advertising and travel spend and other variable store expense savings. Merchandise margin reflects strong mark-on and favorable markdowns net of increased freight costs. The increase in payroll includes a reduction of approximately $46 million for fiscal 2021 from government programs as described in the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced our plan to make online shopping available on www.homegoods.com in late fiscal 2022.33FOREIGN SEGMENTS TJX Canada Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$2,836 $4,031 Segment profit$124 $516 Segment margin4.4 %12.8 %Stores in operation at end of period:Winners280 279 HomeSense143 137 Marshalls102 97 Total525 513 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):Winners6,015 5,986 HomeSense2,644 2,511 Marshalls2,141 2,043 Total10,800 10,540 Net SalesNet sales for TJX Canada decreased 30% for fiscal 2021 compared to last year. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to temporary store closures, closed for approximately 29% of fiscal 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, net sales decreased due to lower customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average basket. Open-only comp store sales were down 8% for fiscal 2021. Segment Profit Segment profit was $124 million for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $392 million, compared to a segment profit of $516 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in sales due to the temporary store closures, including incremental COVID-19 costs. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by improved merchandise margin, a reduction in store payroll while the stores were closed, lower advertising and travel spend and other variable store expense savings. Merchandise margin reflects strong mark-on net of increased markdowns and freight. The reduction in payroll reflects approximately $148 million for fiscal 2021 from government programs as described in the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. In addition, a significant portion of our occupancy costs are fixed. As a result, while our occupancy costs were comparable to last year, they negatively impacted segment margin by approximately 3.8 percentage points, primarily due to the lower sales volume.34TJX International Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$3,842 $5,665 Segment (loss) profit$(504)$307 Segment margin(13.1)%5.4 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.K.

The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the temporary store closures, closed for approximately 36% of fiscal 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, net sales decreased due to lower customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in the average basket. Open-only comp store sales were down 2% for fiscal 2021. E-commerce sales were approximately 5% of TJX International’s net sales for fiscal 2021 and 3% for fiscal 2020. Along with our stores, we temporarily closed our online business for a portion of fiscal 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once reopened during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the online business remained open through fiscal 2021.Segment (Loss) / ProfitSegment loss was $(504) million for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $811 million, compared to a segment profit of $307 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in sales due to the temporary store closures. In addition, the decrease reflects increased markdowns on merchandise due to the COVID-19 pandemic and incremental COVID-19 costs. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by reduced store payroll, a reduction in occupancy costs and lower advertising and travel spend. The reduction in payroll reflects approximately $140 million for fiscal 2021 from government programs as described in the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. In addition, a significant portion of our occupancy costs are fixed. As a result, while our occupancy costs were comparable to last year, they negatively impacted segment margin by approximately 3.1 percentage points, primarily due to the lower sales volume.GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020General corporate expense$439 $557 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The decrease in general corporate expense for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by lower share-based and incentive compensation costs.35ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 30, 2021, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. As part of the actions we have taken, and are continuing to take, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described in Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic above and in Note B—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, TJX issued $4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we refinanced $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of our higher interest notes with the issuance and sale of $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. For additional information on these transactions, see Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2020, we drew down $1 billion on our revolving credit facilities, subsequently repaying these borrowings in July 2020. On August 10, 2020, we increased our borrowing capacity by entering into a $500 million 364-day facility, making a total of $1.5 billion available to us under revolving credit facilities. See Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these transactions. No dividend was declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share, paid in March 2021. We declared a similar dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. We have currently suspended our share repurchase program. We qualified for certain government programs in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and other jurisdictions to support payroll and other operating costs. We also reduced spending more broadly across the Company, reducing capital spending, evaluating operating expenses and taking actions to reduce ongoing variable and discretionary spending. We negotiated rent deferrals for fiscal 2021 for a significant amount of our stores, primarily for second quarter lease payments, with repayment at later dates, primarily in fiscal 2022. In addition to negotiating deferral of lease payments, we also temporarily extended payment terms on merchandise orders which increased our accounts payable as of the end of the fiscal year, benefiting our operating cash flows. As payment terms are reduced and we make deferred payments, we expect our operating cash flows to be negatively impacted. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continue to evolve. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. We may use operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures.As of January 30, 2021, TJX held $10.5 billion in cash. Approximately $1.2 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $0.8 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. TJX has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through January 30, 2021. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and $4.1 billion in fiscal 2020. Our operating cash flows increased by $0.5 billion compared to fiscal 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our operating cash flows. The loss of sales as a result of temporarily closing our stores and e-commerce businesses resulted in net income of $0.1 billion for the twelve month period ended January 30, 2021 compared with net income of $3.3 billion in the twelve month period ended February 1, 2020. This decrease in cash flows was more than offset by the combination of a $2.1 billion favorable impact from the increase in accounts payable, a $0.9 billion favorable impact due to the decrease in merchandise inventories, as well as a $0.6 billion favorable impact due to the increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and lease liabilities. The favorable impact of the change in merchandise inventories, net of accounts payable was driven by the timing of payments for merchandise sold and lower inventories.36Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $0.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures and, in fiscal 2020, we invested $0.2 billion in Familia, an established off-price apparel and home fashion retail chain in Russia. Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below. Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 30,2021February 1,2020New stores$61 $189 Store renovations and improvements124 363 Office and distribution centers383 671 Total capital expenditures$568 $1,223 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 will be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, including approximately $0.7 billion to $0.8 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth, approximately $0.4 billion to $0.5 billion for store renovations and approximately $0.1 billion for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2021 and net cash outflows of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, these cash inflows were primarily driven by debt transactions. In fiscal 2020, the cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by issuances of common stock.DebtThe cash inflows in fiscal 2021 were a result of completing the issuance and sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of (a) $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due 2025, (b) $0.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.750% notes due 2027, (c) $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.875% notes due 2030 and (d) $0.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% notes due 2050. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we drew down $1 billion on our previously undrawn revolving credit facilities, which were paid off in full during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter, we issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes and accepted $1.1 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of certain of our notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 pursuant to cash tender offers. We paid $1.4 billion aggregate consideration in connection with the tender offers, including transaction costs and recorded a $312 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes. See Note K—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.EquityUnder our stock repurchase programs, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, TJX paid $0.2 billion to repurchase and subsequently retired 3.4 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis. These outflows were offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, net of shares withheld for taxes in fiscal 2021. Under our stock repurchase programs, TJX spent $1.6 billion to repurchase 28.2 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2020. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note E—Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2020, TJX announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. In March 2020, in connection with the actions taken related to the COVID-19 pandemic as described in Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic above and in Note B—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we suspended our share repurchase program.DividendsIn March 2020, we paid our quarterly dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which totaled $0.3 billion. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, no dividends were declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, paid in March 2021. We also declared a similar dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. TJX declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.92 per share in fiscal 2020. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $0.3 billion in fiscal 2021 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. 37Contractual Obligations As of January 30, 2021, we had known contractual obligations under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments), other long-term obligations, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows:Payments Due by PeriodIn millionsTotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsLong-term debt and other long-term obligations(a)$7,510 $918 $808 $1,518 $4,266 Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest(b)10,277 2,050 3,300 2,419 2,508 Purchase obligations(c)5,019 4,785 232 2 — Total obligations$22,806 $7,753 $4,340 $3,939 $6,774 (a)Includes estimated interest costs.(b)Operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our Lease Accounting Policy. The balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2021. (c)Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be canceled without penalty.We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $680 million for employee compensation and benefits and $264 million for uncertain tax positions.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.Inventory ValuationWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, however we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.Impairment of Long-lived AssetsWe evaluate our long-lived assets, inclusive of operating lease right of use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals or using other valuation techniques.38Lease AccountingOperating leases are included in “Operating lease right of use assets”, “Current portion of operating lease liabilities”, and “Long-term operating lease liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. At the inception of the arrangement, we determine if an arrangement is a lease based on assessment of the terms and conditions of the contract. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The majority of our leases are retail store locations and the possession date is typically 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store and generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease. Our lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at possession date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated based on the US Consumer Discretionary yield curve and adjusted for collateralization and foreign currency impact for TJX International and TJX Canada leases. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any acquisition costs offset by lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term within “Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs”. Reserves for Uncertain Tax PositionsSimilar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.Loss ContingenciesCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements related to income taxes, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.39ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskTJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note F—Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. The analysis indicated a potential impact of approximately $38 million on our pre-tax income in fiscal 2021 and approximately $82 million in fiscal 2020.EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISKThe assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note J—Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:50:56.790425

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to our future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to us, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K. Our results are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TJX undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2022), January 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021), February 1, 2020 (fiscal 2020) and January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2023).The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021.OVERVIEWWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and five distinctive branded e-commerce sites. We operate nearly 4,700 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods, Homesense, and homegoods.com); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSMatters Affecting ComparabilityThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the U.S. and other countries around the world in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, while our stores in the U.S. and all of our e-commerce businesses remained open for the entire period, we did have government-mandated temporary store closures in Europe, Canada and Australia, resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022. Additionally, intermittently throughout the year, we operated under government-mandated shopping restrictions, including capacity limitations. Stores were temporarily closed for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021 due to temporary closures across all geographies. Overall, our fiscal 2022 results were significantly better than our fiscal 2021 results.In addition to comparing current year results to fiscal 2021, we may, where meaningful, also compare these results to a comparable period in the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, prior to the emergence of the pandemic. We believe this additional comparison provides insight into how we are managing the business and performing as compared to our pre-pandemic results. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2022 include the following:–Net sales were $48.5 billion, $32.1 billion, and $41.7 billion for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. As of January 29, 2022, the number of stores in operation increased approximately 3% and selling square footage increased 2% compared to the end of fiscal 2021.–Diluted earnings per share were $2.70 for fiscal 2022, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.15 per share, compared to $0.07 for fiscal 2021, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.19 per share, and $2.67 for fiscal 2020.–Pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 9.1%, 0.3%, and 10.6% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. –A debt extinguishment charge of $0.2 billion reduced fiscal 2022 pre-tax margin by 0.5 percentage points and a debt extinguishment charge of $0.3 billion reduced fiscal 2021 pre-tax margin by 1.0 percentage point. –Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio was 71.5%, 76.3%, and 71.5% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. 24–Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio was 18.7%, 21.8%, and 17.9% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. –Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, were up 31% on a reported basis and 32% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, and we were up 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2020. –During fiscal 2022, we returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. A dividend of $0.26 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and paid in March of 2022.Operating Results as a Percentage of Net SalesThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.

As of March 2, 2022, Douglas Mizzi and Scott Goldenberg have resigned from their director and observer positions, respectively, on Familia’s board of directors, effective immediately. As a result of this commitment to divest, we may recognize an investment loss of up to $225 million. Prior to divestiture, we may be required to record an impairment charge if the fair value of our investment in Familia declines below its carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2020, we invested $225 million for a 25% non-controlling, minority interest in privately held Familia. Familia, domiciled in Luxembourg, is an off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions with more than 400 stores in Russia. We account for our investment in Familia using the equity method of accounting. As of January 29, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Familia was $186 million, which reflects the revaluing of the investment from Russian rubles to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a cumulative translation loss and reducing the carrying value of our investment by approximately $40 million. See additional information on the Equity Investment in Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.COVID-19The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our global retail operations that began during fiscal 2021 continued to impact our business in fiscal 2022. We entered fiscal 2022 with significant ongoing global uncertainty related to the pandemic. The health and safety of our Associates and customers remained a top priority during fiscal 2022, and we continue to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations that could result in possible additional impacts to our operations.The below table represents total store days closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a percentage of potential total store days open in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 by segment. Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2021Marmaxx— %20 %HomeGoods— %20 %TJX Canada12 %29 %TJX International19 %36 %TJX Consolidated4 %24 %25Net SalesNet sales totaled $48.5 billion, $32.1 billion, and $41.7 billion for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 3% of total sales for each of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.As a result of the extensive temporary store closures during fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our practice relating to the treatment of extended temporary store closures when calculating comp store sales, we had no stores classified as comp stores at the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2022, we temporarily reported open-only comp store sales, as described below. For fiscal 2023, we intend to return to our historical definition of comparable store sales. While stores in the U.S. were open for all of fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International experienced COVID-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during fiscal 2022. Therefore, we cannot measure year-over-year comparable store sales with fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the fiscal 2023 measure will consist of U.S. stores only, which, we intend to refer to as U.S. comparable store sales and will be calculated against sales for the comparable periods in fiscal 2022. Our historical definition of comp store sales is also presented below for reference. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021Net sales increased 51% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Our stores in the U.S. and all of our e-commerce businesses remained open for the entire period, while we had temporary closures in Europe, Canada, and Australia resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022, as compared to stores across all geographies being temporarily closed for approximately 24% for fiscal 2021. In addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket.Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020Net sales increased 16% and open-only comp store sales were up 15% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. U.S. open-only comp store sales were up 17% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. This reflects an increase in average basket across all divisions. Customer traffic was up in the U.S., where stores were open for all of fiscal 2022, and was down in geographies where we had COVID-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions. Our open-only comp store sales increase in home fashions was significantly above our overall open-only comp increase. In apparel, we had strong open-only comp store sales growth during fiscal 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Historical Comparable Store SalesHistorically, we defined comparable store sales, or comp sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculated comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.Sales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consist of sales from:–New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales–Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time–Sales from our e-commerce sites, meaning sierra.com, tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, homegoods.com and tkmaxx.comWe determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. Beginning in fiscal 2020, Sierra stores that fit the comp store definition were included in comp stores in our Marmaxx segment.Comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales using the prior year’s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.Comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies.We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions. 26Open-Only Comp Store SalesDue to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our historical definition of comp store sales is not applicable for the reported periods. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we temporarily reported open-only comp store sales. Open-only comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that had to temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in fiscal 2020, prior to the pandemic. Open-only comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year using fiscal 2020’s exchange rates. Revenues by GeographyThe percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last three fiscal years are as follows:Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2021Fiscal 2020United States:Northeast23 %23 %23 %Midwest13 13 13 South (including Puerto Rico)27 27 25 West16 16 15 Total United States79 %79 %76 %Canada9 9 10 Europe11 11 13 Australia1 1 1 Total TJX100 %100 %100 %Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesOur operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies. We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange,” also described below.Translation Foreign ExchangeIn our consolidated financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.Mark-to-Market Inventory DerivativesWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.Transactional Foreign ExchangeWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.27Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy CostsCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was $34.7 billion, or 71.5% of net sales, $24.5 billion, or 76.3% of net sales, $29.8 billion, or 71.5% of net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021The increase in the total cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was primarily due to the additional cost of merchandise sold due to a higher level of sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Our stores were temporarily closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022 and approximately 24% of fiscal 2021. Merchandise margin improved during fiscal 2022, primarily driven by favorable markdowns, offset by increased freight costs. In addition, supply chain costs increased due to additional investments in distribution capacity and higher wages, which, along with freight costs, are expected to continue into the next fiscal year.Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was favorably impacted by approximately $27 million and $78 million of government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, in regions where we had temporary store closures. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020 The expense ratio was flat for fiscal 2022 compared to the fiscal 2020. The ratio reflects the leverage on our occupancy costs due to the strong open-only comp store sales growth. Within merchandise margin, strong markon and lower markdowns more than offset approximately 200 basis points of incremental freight costs in fiscal 2022. The occupancy and merchandise margin improvements were offset by higher supply chain costs primarily due to additional investments to expand distribution capacity and higher wage costs.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses were $9.1 billion, or 18.7% of net sales, $7.0 billion, or 21.8% of net sales and $7.5 billion, or 17.9% of net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021The increase in SG&A expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher store payroll costs to support a higher sales volume. In addition to these costs, incentive compensation costs and other variable store costs, such as advertising spend and credit processing fees, were higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.SG&A expense was favorably impacted by $214 million and $434 million from government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, in regions where we had temporary store closures. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020 The expense ratio increased 0.8% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to incremental COVID-19 related payroll costs. Loss on Early Extinguishment of DebtOn June 4, 2021, we completed make-whole calls for our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Notes maturing in 2025 and our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes maturing in 2027. As a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities, we recorded a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. For additional information on the debt transactions, see Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In fiscal 2021, we completed the issuance and sale of certain of our Notes and used the proceeds to partially fund the purchase of certain Notes, resulting in a pre-tax early extinguishment debt charge of $312 million. 28Interest Expense, netThe components of interest expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021Interest expense$123 $199 Capitalized interest(4)(5)Interest (income)(4)(13)Interest expense, net$115 $181 Net interest expense decreased for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the prior year’s refinancing of certain notes in December 2020 as well as the $2.75 billion pay down of outstanding debt during fiscal 2022. Provision (Benefit) for Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 25.4%, (1.4)%, and 25.7% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. The increase in the fiscal 2022 effective income tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in profit in fiscal 2022 as compared to the mix of income and losses by jurisdictions in fiscal 2021. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareNet income was $3.3 billion, $0.1 billion, and $3.3 billion in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 were $2.70, which included a second quarter debt extinguishment charge of $0.15, $0.07 in fiscal 2021, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.19, and $2.67 in fiscal 2020. Segment InformationWe operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and our HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods, Homesense and homegoods.com) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.When discussing current year segment results, in addition to comparing to fiscal 2021, we may, where meaningful, also compare these results to a comparable period in fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the pandemic. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.29U.S. SEGMENTSMarmaxx Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$29,483 $19,363 $25,665 Segment profit$3,813 $891 $3,470 Segment margin12.9 %4.6 %13.5 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.J.

The increase in net sales reflects stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022. Stores were closed for approximately 20% of fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket.Net sales increased 15% compared to $25.7 billion for fiscal 2020. Open-only comp store sales were up 13% compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in open-only comp store sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in average basket. In addition, customer traffic was up slightly. While our open-only comp store sales increase in home fashions continued to significantly exceed those of apparel, we had strong open-only comp store sales growth in apparel for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we had strong sales at Marmaxx across all geographic regions.Segment Profit Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021Segment profit was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion, compared to a segment profit of $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales due to stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022. Merchandise margin improved primarily due to lower markdowns, partially offset by incremental freight costs. Fiscal 2021 also benefited $171 million from government programs.Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020Segment profit increased by $0.3 billion compared to a segment profit of $3.5 billion for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the increase in sales. Segment profit margin decreased to 12.9% for fiscal 2022 compared to 13.5% for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by incremental COVID-19 related store payroll costs and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by leverage on occupancy costs due to the strong open-only comp store sales growth and improved merchandise margin. Within merchandise margin, strong markon and lower markdowns collectively more than offset incremental freight costs.Our Marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. In fiscal 2023, we expect to open approximately 55 Marmaxx stores and 20 Sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.30HomeGoods Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$8,995 $6,096 $6,356 Segment profit$907 $510 $681 Segment margin10.1 %8.4 %10.7 %Stores in operation at end of period:HomeGoods850 821 809 Homesense39 34 32 Total889 855 841 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):HomeGoods15,550 15,034 14,831 Homesense837 733 685 Total16,387 15,767 15,516 Net SalesNet sales for HomeGoods were $9.0 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of 48%, compared to $6.1 billion for fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales reflects stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022. Stores were temporarily closed for approximately 20% of fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket. Net sales increased 42% compared to $6.4 billion for fiscal 2020. Open-only comp store sales were up 32% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in open-only comp store sales was driven by an increase in average basket and customer traffic. During fiscal 2022, we had strong sales at HomeGoods and Homesense across all major categories and geographic regions.Segment Profit Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021Segment profit was $0.9 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to a segment profit of $0.5 billion for fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales due to stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022, partially offset by lower merchandise margin due to increased freight costs. Fiscal 2021 also benefited $46 million from government programs. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020Segment profit increased by $0.2 billion compared to a segment profit of $0.7 billion for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the increase in sales. Segment profit margin decreased to 10.1% for fiscal 2022 compared to 10.7% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower merchandise margin, and incremental COVID-19 related store payroll costs and higher store wages, partially offset by the expense leverage on our occupancy and administrative costs due to the strong open-only comp store sales growth. Within merchandise margin, incremental freight costs more than offset strong markon and lower markdowns. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, HomeGoods made online shopping available on www.homegoods.com.In fiscal 2023, we expect to open approximately 60 HomeGoods stores, including 10 Homesense stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 7%.31FOREIGN SEGMENTS TJX Canada Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$4,343 $2,836 $4,031 Segment profit$485 $124 $516 Segment margin11.2 %4.4 %12.8 %Stores in operation at end of period:Winners293 280 279 HomeSense147 143 137 Marshalls106 102 97 Total546 525 513 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands):Winners6,300 6,015 5,986 HomeSense2,708 2,644 2,511 Marshalls2,220 2,141 2,043 Total11,228 10,800 10,540 Net SalesNet sales for TJX Canada were $4.3 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of 53% compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales reflected temporary store closures, which were closed for approximately 12% of fiscal 2022 and 29% of fiscal 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket. Net sales for TJX Canada increased 8% compared to $4.0 billion for fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2% for fiscal 2022. Open-only comp store sales were up 8% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020 and were negatively impacted by significant government-mandated shopping restrictions. The increase in open-only comp store sales was driven by an increase in average basket, partially offset by reduced customer traffic.Segment Profit Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021Segment profit was $0.5 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to a segment profit of $0.1 billion for fiscal 2021. The increase for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by increased sales due to having fewer temporary store closures in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Within merchandise margin, lower markdowns and higher markon were partially offset by increased freight costs. Fiscal 2022 also reflected $84 million of government programs compared to $148 million for fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020Segment profit decreased $31 million compared to a segment profit of $516 million for fiscal 2020. Segment profit margin decreased to 11.2% for fiscal 2022 compared to 12.8% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs and higher store payroll, including incremental COVID-19 related costs, net of government programs. This was partially offset by improved merchandise margin. Within merchandise margin, strong markon and lower markdowns collectively more than offset incremental freight costs. In fiscal 2023, we expect to open approximately 10 stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 1%.32TJX International Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021February 1,2020Net sales$5,729 $3,842 $5,665 Segment profit (loss)$161 $(504)$307 Segment margin2.8 %(13.1)%5.4 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.K.

The increase in open-only comp store sales was driven by an increase in average basket, partially offset by reduced customer traffic.E-commerce sales at tkmaxx.com represented less than 6% of TJX International’s net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. Segment Profit/(Loss)Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021Segment profit was $0.2 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $0.7 billion, compared to a segment loss of $(0.5) billion for fiscal 2021. The increase for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by increased sales due to having fewer temporary store closures in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in segment profit includes improved merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns. Fiscal 2022 also reflected $157 million of government programs compared to $140 million for fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2020Segment profit decreased $0.1 billion compared to a segment profit of $0.3 billion for fiscal 2020. Segment profit margin decreased to 2.8% for fiscal 2022 compared to 5.4% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in segment profit was primarily driven by incremental store payroll, higher supply chain costs and reduced merchandise margin. Within merchandise margin, increased freight expense was partially offset by lower markdowns. Segment profit was favorably impacted by the government programs received in fiscal 2022.In fiscal 2023, we expect to open approximately 15 stores in Europe and approximately 10 stores in Australia, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 3%.33GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021General corporate expense$611 $439 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher share-based and incentive compensation costs.ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 29, 2022, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have $1.5 billion available as of the period ended January 29, 2022, as described in Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. As of January 29, 2022, we held $6.2 billion in cash. Approximately $1.4 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $0.6 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. We have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through January 29, 2022. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.We monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2022 we have used, and in the future we may use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures. Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022 and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2021. Our operating cash flows decreased by $1.5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 due to the $4.7 billion change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable, driven by rebuilding inventory levels in fiscal 2022 as well as the timing of merchandise payments in fiscal 2021. In addition, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the $0.3 billion decrease in net operating lease liabilities due to the repayment of many of the rent deferrals negotiated in fiscal 2021. The decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $3.2 billion increase in net income. Temporary store closures in fiscal 2021 resulted in net income of $0.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to net income of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2022. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2022 and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2021. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures and were lower in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 34Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 29,2022January 30,2021New stores$79 $61 Store renovations and improvements367 124 Office and distribution centers599 383 Total capital expenditures$1,045 $568 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 will be in the range of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth, approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion for store renovations and approximately $0.2 billion for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $6.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash inflows of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, the cash outflows were primarily driven by debt repayments, equity repurchases and dividend payments. In fiscal 2021, the cash inflows were primarily driven by debt transactions. DebtThe cash outflows in fiscal 2022 were due to the completion of make-whole calls and the redemption at par of certain of our notes. The notes redeemed via make-whole calls were issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities, we recorded a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million in fiscal 2022. Additionally, in fiscal 2022 we redeemed at par $750 million principal outstanding, 2.75% Notes due June 15, 2021. The result of these debt redemptions resulted in a $2.75 billion reduction of outstanding debt since the beginning of fiscal 2022 and will result in more than $90 million of annualized interest expense savings. The cash inflows in fiscal 2021 were a result of completing the issuance and sale of $4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. See Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.EquityIn fiscal 2022, we lifted the temporary suspension of our repurchase program and we paid $2.2 billion to repurchase and retire 31.3 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis under our previously authorized stock repurchase programs. Prior to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program, we paid $0.2 billion to repurchase and retire 3.4 million shares on a settlement basis in fiscal 2021. These outflows for both periods were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, net of shares withheld for taxes, of $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. In January 2022, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of our common stock from time to time. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.25 billion to $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2023. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements, and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. As of January 29, 2022, approximately $3.8 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D—Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.DividendsWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of $0.26 per share for each of the quarters in fiscal 2022 which totaled $1.04 per share in fiscal 2022. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, no dividends were declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2023 of $0.295 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.18 per share, subject to the declaration and approval by our Board of Directors. This would represent a 13% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2022.35Contractual Obligations See the descriptions of our financing arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. –See Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for future payments under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments).–See Note L—Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 170 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our Lease Accounting Policy. The balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2022.–See Note M—Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, Current and Long Term of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid, which includes $0.6 billion for employee compensation and benefits and $0.3 billion for uncertain tax positions.–We also have non-cancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting estimates, involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.Inventory ValuationWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. We have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods; however, we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.Reserves for Uncertain Tax PositionsSimilar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.36Loss ContingenciesCertain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of any new accounting pronouncements, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E—Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. The analysis indicated a potential impact of approximately $65 million on our pre-tax income in fiscal 2022 and approximately $38 million in fiscal 2021.EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISKThe assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I—Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:50:49.802686

Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and five distinctive branded e-commerce sites. We operate over 4,800 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods, Homesense, and homegoods.com); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSHighlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2023 include the following:–Net sales increased 3% to $49.9 billion for fiscal 2023 versus $48.5 billion for fiscal 2022. As of January 28, 2023, both the number of stores in operation and selling square footage increased approximately 3% compared to the end of fiscal 2022.–U.S. comp store sales were flat in fiscal 2023. U.S. open-only comp store sales increased 17% for fiscal 2022. See Net Sales below for definitions of both U.S. comp store sales and U.S. open-only comp store sales.–Net sales increased 13% for TJX Canada and increased 8% for TJX International in fiscal 2023. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 18% for TJX Canada and increased 22% for TJX International. –Diluted earnings per share were $2.97 for fiscal 2023, which included a $0.14 net of tax charge related to the write-down and the divestiture of our minority investment in Familia, compared to $2.70 for fiscal 2022, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.15 per share.–Pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for fiscal 2023 was 9.3%, which included a 0.4 percentage point charge related to the write-down of our minority investment in Familia. This was a 0.2 percentage point increase compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2022, which included a 0.5 percentage point debt extinguishment charge. –Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2023 was 72.4%, a 0.9 percentage point increase compared to 71.5% for fiscal 2022. –Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2023 was 17.9%, a 0.8 percentage point decrease compared to 18.7% for fiscal 2022.–Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, were up 1% on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior year.–During fiscal 2023, we returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. A dividend of $0.295 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and paid in March 2023.26Operating Results as a Percentage of Net SalesThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.

The increase includes a 5% increase in non-comp store sales, partially offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. The non-comp store sales increase reflects a fully open store base for fiscal 2023 compared to temporary store closures in fiscal 2022. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 3% of total sales for each of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.For fiscal 2023, we returned to our historical definition of comparable store sales (as defined below). While stores in the U.S. were open for all of fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International experienced COVID-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during fiscal 2022. Therefore, we cannot measure year-over-year comparable store sales with fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the fiscal 2023 measure consist of U.S. stores only, which we refer to as U.S. comparable store sales (“U.S. comp store sales”), and are calculated against sales for the comparable periods in fiscal 2022. We expect all geographies to return to the historical definition of comparable store sales in fiscal 2024.U.S. comp store sales were flat for fiscal 2023 compared to a 17% U.S. open-only comp store sales (as defined below) increase for fiscal 2022. U.S. comp store sales for fiscal 2023 reflect an increase in average basket driven by higher average ticket offset by a decrease in customer traffic. Strong apparel sales offset a decline in home fashions sales for fiscal 2023.As of January 28, 2023, our store count increased 3% and selling square footage increased 3% compared to the same period last year.Definition of Comparable Store SalesWe define comparable store sales, or comp store sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculate comp store sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.Sales excluded from comp store sales (“non-comp store sales”) consist of sales from:–New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp store sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp store sales–Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time–Sales from our e-commerce sitesWe determine which stores are included in the comp store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. Comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp store sales using the prior year’s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.27Comp store sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp store sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp store sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies.We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions. Open-Only Comp Store SalesDue to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our historical definition of comp store sales was not applicable for fiscal 2022. In order to provide a performance indicator for its stores, during fiscal 2022, we temporarily reported open-only comp store sales. Open-only comp store sales included stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021. This measure reported the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in fiscal 2022 against sales for the same days in fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the global pandemic. U.S. open-only comp store sales reports the open-only comp store sales for our Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments.Revenues by GeographyThe percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last two fiscal years are as follows:Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022United States:Northeast22 %23 %Midwest13 13 South (including Puerto Rico)27 27 West15 16 Total United States77 %79 %Canada10 9 Europe12 11 Australia1 1 Total TJX100 %100 %Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesOur operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies. We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency, which is referred to as “transactional foreign exchange,” and also described below.Translation Foreign ExchangeIn our consolidated financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.Mark-to-Market Inventory DerivativesWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.28Transactional Foreign ExchangeWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy CostsCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 72.4% for fiscal 2023, an increase of 0.9 percentage points over 71.5% of net sales for fiscal 2022. The increase in the total cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was primarily attributable to lower merchandise margin and investments in supply chain. Merchandise margin reflected approximately 1.2 percentage points of incremental freight costs as well as higher markdowns and shrink expense, partially offset by strong markon. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was favorably impacted by approximately $9 million and $27 million of government programs for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, in regions where we had temporary store closures. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 17.9% for fiscal 2023, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points over 18.7% for fiscal 2022.The decrease in SG&A ratio for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by store payroll due to a reduction of COVID-related costs and lower share-based and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by higher store wages.SG&A expense was favorably impacted by $214 million from government programs for fiscal 2022 in regions where we had temporary store closures.Impairment on Equity InvestmentDuring fiscal 2023, we announced and completed the divestiture of our minority investment in Familia. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $218 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 representing the entire carrying value of the investment. Additionally, we realized a $54 million tax benefit when we completed the divestiture of this investment during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Interest Expense, netThe components of interest expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022Interest expense$91 $123 Capitalized interest(7)(4)Interest (income)(78)(4)Interest expense, net$6 $115 Net interest expense decreased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income, due to an increase in prevailing rates, as well as the $2.75 billion pay down of outstanding debt during fiscal 2022. Provision for Income TaxesIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and levies a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. The excise tax on the net repurchase portion of the IRA did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position in fiscal 2023 and we do not expect the Corporate AMT, excise tax, or other provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.The effective income tax rate was 24.5% for fiscal 2023 compared to 25.4% for fiscal 2022. The decrease in the fiscal 2023 effective income tax rate was primarily due to the lapse of statutes of limitations and resolution of various tax matters, and the change of jurisdictional mix of profits and losses, partially offset by a reduction of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. 29Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareNet income was $3.5 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2022. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023 were $2.97 compared to $2.70 in fiscal 2022. The $218 million impairment on our previously-held minority investment in Familia, net of the $54 million tax benefit, had a $0.14 negative impact on earnings per share for fiscal 2023. Foreign currency had a $0.06 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2023 compared to a neutral impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2022. A $242 million debt extinguishment charge in fiscal 2022 had a $0.15 negative impact on earnings per share for fiscal 2022.Segment InformationWe operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and our HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods, Homesense and homegoods.com) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.30U.S. SEGMENTSMarmaxx Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022Net sales$30,545 $29,483 Segment profit$3,883 $3,813 Segment margin12.7 %12.9 %Comp store sales(a)3 %13 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.J.

Maxx28 28 Marshalls27 26 Sierra1 1 Total56 55 (a)Comp store sales reported for fiscal 2023 and open-only comp store sales reported for fiscal 2022. Net SalesNet sales for Marmaxx were $30.5 billion for fiscal 2023, an increase of 4% compared to $29.5 billion for fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales reflects a 3% increase from comp store sales and a 1% increase from non-comp store sales. Comp sales growth at Marmaxx was primarily attributable to an increase in average basket driven by higher average ticket. For fiscal 2023, positive apparel sales outperformed a decline in home fashion sales. All geographies generally performed in line with the overall comp store sales increase.Segment Profit Margin Segment profit margin decreased to 12.7% for fiscal 2023 compared to a segment profit margin of 12.9% for fiscal 2022. The decrease in segment profit margin was driven by lower merchandise margin and higher store wages, partially offset by store payroll reflecting lower COVID-related expenses. Within merchandise margin, incremental freight costs, higher markdowns and shrink expense were partially offset by strong markon. Our Marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. In fiscal 2024, we expect to add approximately 45 Marmaxx net new stores and 18 new Sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.31HomeGoods Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022Net sales$8,264 $8,995 Segment profit$522 $907 Segment margin6.3 %10.1 %Comp store sales(a)(11)%32 %Stores in operation at end of period:HomeGoods894 850 Homesense46 39 Total940 889 Selling square footage at end of period (in millions):HomeGoods16 15 Homesense1 1 Total17 16 (a)Comp store sales reported for fiscal 2023 and open-only comp store sales reported for fiscal 2022.Net SalesNet sales for HomeGoods were $8.3 billion for fiscal 2023, a decrease of 8%, compared to $9.0 billion for fiscal 2022. The decrease in net sales reflects an 11% decrease from comp store sales, partially offset by a 3% increase from non-comp store sales. Comp store sales decline for HomeGoods for fiscal 2023 reflected a decrease in customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in average basket driven by higher average ticket. All geographies performed in line with the overall comp store sales decline.Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin decreased to 6.3% for fiscal 2023 compared to a segment profit margin of 10.1% for fiscal 2022. The decrease in segment profit margin for fiscal 2023 was driven by deleverage on lower comp store sales, primarily in occupancy and administrative costs, lower merchandise margin and higher store and distribution wages, partially offset by store payroll reflecting lower COVID-related expenses. Merchandise margin included incremental freight costs of approximately 3 percentage points as well as higher markdowns, partially offset by strong markon.Our HomeGoods e-commerce site, homegoods.com, represented less than 1% of HomeGoods net sales for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.In fiscal 2024, we expect to add up to approximately 50 HomeGoods stores, of which 18 are Homesense stores. This would increase selling square footage by approximately 6%.32FOREIGN SEGMENTS TJX Canada Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022Net sales$4,912 $4,343 Segment profit$690 $485 Segment margin14.0 %11.2 %Stores in operation at end of period:Winners297 293 HomeSense151 147 Marshalls106 106 Total554 546 Selling square footage at end of period (in millions):Winners6 6 HomeSense3 3 Marshalls2 2 Total11 11 Net SalesNet sales for TJX Canada were $4.9 billion for fiscal 2023, an increase of 13% compared to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales reflected having a fully open store base for fiscal 2023, compared to temporary store closures in fiscal 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within net sales, an increase in average basket driven by higher average ticket was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 5% for fiscal 2023.Segment Profit Margin Segment profit margin increased to 14.0% for fiscal 2023 compared to a segment profit margin of 11.2% for fiscal 2022. The increase for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by leverage on increased sales, primarily in occupancy and administrative costs, and higher merchandise margin as well as lower store payroll reflecting lower COVID-related expenses, and lower incentive compensation costs. Merchandise margin reflects strong markon partially offset by incremental freight costs for fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, we expect to add approximately 11 stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.33TJX International Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022Net sales$6,215 $5,729 Segment profit$347 $161 Segment margin5.6 %2.8 %Stores in operation at end of period:T.K.

The increase in net sales reflects having a fully open store base, compared to temporary store closures in fiscal 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 14%.E-commerce sales at tkmaxx.com were approximately 3% and 5% of TJX International’s net sales for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Segment Profit MarginSegment profit margin increased to 5.6% for fiscal 2023 compared to a segment profit margin of 2.8% for fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by leverage on increased sales, primarily in occupancy and administrative costs as well as higher merchandise margin, lower COVID-related expenses in stores and distribution centers and lower incentive compensation costs. Within merchandise margin, strong markon was partially offset by incremental freight costs and higher markdowns. Fiscal 2022 also reflected $157 million from government programs received in regions where we had temporary store closures.In fiscal 2024, we expect to add approximately 18 net new stores in Europe and approximately 6 net new stores in Australia, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022General corporate expense$582 $611 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel and inventory hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The decrease in general corporate expense for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower share-based and incentive compensation costs, timing of funding to TJX’s charitable foundations partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustment on fuel and inventory derivatives.34ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 28, 2023, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we had $1.5 billion available as of the period ended January 28, 2023, as described in Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. As of January 28, 2023, we held $5.5 billion in cash. Approximately $1.2 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $0.7 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. We have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through January 28, 2023. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.We monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. In fiscal 2024, we intend to use and in the future we may continue to use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures. Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in fiscal 2023 and $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022. Our operating cash flows increased by $1 billion compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the $1.5 billion change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable. The change in inventory was primarily driven by the fiscal 2022 rebuilding of inventory levels. The increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $0.7 billion decrease in accrued expenses, the largest component of which was lower incentive compensation costs. Investing ActivitiesInvesting activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023 and $1 billion in fiscal 2022. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsJanuary 28,2023January 29,2022New stores$164 $79 Store renovations and improvements594 367 Office and distribution centers699 599 Total capital expenditures$1,457 $1,045 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 will be in the range of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including approximately $0.9 billion to $1 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth, approximately $0.6 billion to $0.7 billion for store renovations and approximately $0.2 billion for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to net cash outflows of $6.2 billion in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023 the cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments. In fiscal 2022 the cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases, dividend payments and $3 billion of debt repayments.35DebtThe cash outflows in fiscal 2022 were due to the completion of make-whole calls and the redemption at par of certain of our notes. Our 2.50% ten-year Notes due May 2023 will mature during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and are included within our current maturities of long-term debt. See Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.EquityUnder our stock repurchase program, we paid $2.3 billion to repurchase and retire 34.9 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis in fiscal 2023. We paid $2.2 billion to repurchase and retire 31.3 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis in fiscal 2022. These outflows for both periods were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $0.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022. In February 2023, the Board of Directors announced a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2024. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements, and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. As of January 28, 2023, approximately $3.5 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D—Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which became law in August 2022, levies a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. Historically, during the year we have made discretionary share repurchases. Beginning on January 1, 2023, these purchases are subject to the excise tax. The excise tax on the net stock repurchase portion of the IRA did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position in fiscal 2023, and based on historical net repurchase activity, we do not expect it to have a material impact in future years. See Note K—Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.DividendsWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of $0.295 per share for each of the quarters in fiscal 2023 which totaled $1.18 per share in fiscal 2023. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of $0.26 per share for each of the quarters in fiscal 2022, which totaled $1.04 per share in fiscal 2022. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.3 billion for both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2024 of $0.3325 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, subject to the declaration and approval by our Board of Directors. This would represent a 13% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2023.Contractual Obligations See the descriptions of our financing arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. –See Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for future payments under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments).–See Note L—Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 180 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our Lease Accounting Policy. The balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2023.–See Note M—Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, Current and Long Term of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid, which includes $0.6 billion for employee compensation and benefits and $0.2 billion for uncertain tax positions.–We also have non-cancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements.36CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting estimates, involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.Inventory ValuationWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. We have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods; however, we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.Reserves for Uncertain Tax PositionsSimilar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.Loss ContingenciesCertain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of any new accounting pronouncements, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.37ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E—Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. The analysis indicated a potential impact of approximately $104 million on our pre-tax income in fiscal 2023 and approximately $65 million in fiscal 2022.EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISKThe assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I—Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:50:57.991719
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), the 53-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009) and the 52-week fiscal year ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008). Like most retailers we have a 53-week fiscal period every five to six years. This extra week of sales volume, which also provides a lift to pre-tax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses, impacts comparisons to other fiscal periods. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We entered fiscal 2010 faced with the challenges of a worldwide recession and established a three-pronged strategy for managing through the challenging economic times: conservatively plan same store sales, allowing better flow-through to the bottom line if we exceed plans; run with very lean inventories and buy closer to need than in the past, increasing inventory turns and protecting gross margins; and focus on cost-cutting measures and controlling expenses. Implementing this strategy has proven successful, and we posted results significantly above our expectations and ahead of last year on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses. Customer traffic increased as the year progressed, driving sales. Additionally, we took advantage of opportunities the environment presented, opening more new stores than planned and adding many new vendors. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow both sales and earnings in fiscal 2011, driving market share with our value proposition and continuing the marketing, inventory management and cost reduction strategies that were successful in fiscal 2010. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2010 include the following: — Same store sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6% over the prior year. Same store sales growth was driven by significant increases in customer traffic, as we attracted new customers across various income levels, and strong performance by all of our businesses. — Net sales increased 7% to $20.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 3% at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to last fiscal year end. Increases in consolidated same store sales and sales growth from our new stores were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted sales growth by 2 percentage points. Unlike many other retailers, we had a 53rd week in fiscal 2009, which benefited fiscal 2009 sales but negatively impacted the fiscal 2010 comparison by approximately 1 percentage point. — Our fiscal 2010 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 9.6% compared to 7.6% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increased merchandise margins, which were achieved as a result of managing the business with substantially lower levels of inventory. The comparison of pre-tax margins for fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 was adversely impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2009 calendar and a favorable adjustment to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009. Combined, these two items benefited the fiscal 2009 pre-tax margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales, partially offset by the benefit to fiscal 2009’s cost of sales ratio due to the 53rd week included in fiscal 2009. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased by 0.1 percentage points, with the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2010, partially offset by a 0.5 percentage point increase due to performance-based incentive compensation. — Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010 compared to $914.9 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations benefited by $0.16 per share from a number of items, which affected the year-over-year comparison; the 53rd week added $0.09 per share, the credit to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs added $0.04 per share and a tax related adjustment added $0.03 per share. 22 Table of Contents — During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 27.0 million shares of our common stock for $950 million. This year’s repurchases included the use of the $375 million proceeds from our April 2009 debt offering to repurchase a majority of the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes called for redemption. Diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. — Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 10% at the end of fiscal 2010 over the prior year end as compared to a decrease of 6% at the end of fiscal 2009 over the prior year end. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 4% over net sales of $18.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 1% increase from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 over the prior fiscal year. We expect to add 130 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2011, a 5% increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage. The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer traffic at all of our businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction. The increase in customer traffic accelerated during the course of the year. Juniors, dresses, children’s apparel, footwear, accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010. Geographically, same store sales increases in Europe and Canada trailed the consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West Coast above the average, and New England and Florida below the average. The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance, especially at our international segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession. Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, but was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction. As for merchandise categories, footwear, accessories and dresses were the strongest performers, while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions. Geographically, same store sales in Canada and Europe were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and Florida trailed the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance. 23 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 73.8 75.9 75.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.4 16.5 16.3 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs — (0.2 ) 1.1 Interest (income) expense, net 0.2 0.1 — Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 9.6 % 7.6 % 6.9 % * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results can benefit or be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period. Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies (primarily U.S. dollar purchases). As we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by U.S. GAAP, we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of these adjustments is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect cost of sales, operating margins and reported earnings. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.8% in fiscal 2010, 75.9% in fiscal 2009 and 75.7% in fiscal 2008. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53rd week (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation that covers many associates across our organization. The higher accruals are the result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives. This ratio for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased 0.2 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales increase. This deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 (approximately 0.2 percentage points) as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.2 percentage points. Throughout fiscal 2009, we effectively executed our off-price fundamentals, buying close to need, operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.4% in fiscal 2010, 16.5% in fiscal 2009 and 16.3% in fiscal 2008. The improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives. These 24 Table of Contents improvements were partially offset by the increase in performance-based incentive compensation mentioned above, which had an even greater impact on selling, general and administrative expense ratio increasing it by 0.5 percentage points. The fiscal 2009 expense ratio increased slightly compared to fiscal 2008 due to deleverage from the low same store sales increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2008. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the Computer Intrusion. From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2010, we cumulatively expensed $171.5 million (pre-tax) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to the establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations, settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet. As of January 30, 2010, our reserve balance was $23.5 million, which reflects our current estimate of remaining probable losses with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings and other claims, as well as legal, monitoring, reporting and other costs. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve as a result of developments in litigation and claims, related expenses, receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes. Interest expense (income), net: Interest expense (income), net amounted to expense of $39.5 million for fiscal 2010, expense of $14.3 million for fiscal 2009 and income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008. The components of net interest expense (income) for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 49,278 $ 38,123 $ 39,926 Capitalized interest (758) (1,647) (799) Interest (income) (9,011) (22,185) (40,725) Net interest expense (income) $ 39,509 $ 14,291 $ (1,598) Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The 6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 4.20% notes. The impact on earnings per share of the incremental interest cost of these two debt issuances was partially offset by a benefit in our earnings per share, as the majority of the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes were repurchased with the net proceeds of the 6.95% notes. On a full year basis, we expect the benefit of the share repurchase to more than offset the impact on fully diluted earnings per share from the interest on the 6.95% notes. For more information on these note offerings, see the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010. The change in net interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by the change in interest income. In fiscal 2008, we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. 25 Table of Contents Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2010, 36.9% in fiscal 2009 and 37.9% in fiscal 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income. The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflected a 1.3 percentage point favorable impact of a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax position. This benefit in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 0.4 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements. TJX anticipates an effective annual income tax rate of 38.0% to 38.5% for fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, a 33% increase over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009, which in turn was a 17% increase over the $782.4 million in fiscal 2008. Income from continuing operations per share was $2.84 in fiscal 2010, $2.08 in fiscal 2009 and $1.68 in fiscal 2008. Several items, discussed below, affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share in that year by $0.09 per share. The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 by approximately $0.04 per share. The charge relating to the Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008 adversely affected income from continuing operations in that year by $0.25 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2009. When comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rates reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2008. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010; 24.0 million shares at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009; and 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2008. We significantly reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding from 442.3 million to 427.6 million in fiscal 2010 with the incremental purchase over those planned under our stock repurchase program by using the proceeds of our April 2009 debt offering to repurchase the majority of the 15.1 million shares issued on conversion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes following their call. Discontinued operations and net income: Fiscal 2009 and prior periods include the loss on the sale of the Bob’s Stores division in discontinued operations. In addition, the operating results for Bob’s Stores for all periods prior to the sale are included in discontinued operations. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per share, for fiscal 2010, $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009 and $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for fiscal 2008. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and each of HomeGoods and A.J. Wright is reported as a separate segment. TJX’s stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Canada segment, and TJX’s stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 26 Table of Contents operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 13,270.9 $ 12,362.1 $ 11,966.7 Segment profit $ 1,588.5 $ 1,155.8 $ 1,158.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 12.0 % 9.3 % 9.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 7 % 0 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 7% compared to being flat in fiscal 2009. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2010 reflected significantly increased customer traffic, partially offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction. Categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases included juniors, dresses, children’s apparel and footwear. Home categories improved significantly at Marmaxx during the year, with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2010. Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country. Same store sales were strongest in the Midwest, West Coast and Southeast, while New England and Florida trailed the chain average for fiscal 2010. We also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year, and we anticipate increasing our store renovation program in fiscal 2011. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to 12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in fiscal 2009. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 2.4 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon. In addition, the 7% increase in same store sales provided expense leverage on numerous costs as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. Segment margin decreased to 9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (0.5 percentage points) due to deleverage on the flat same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin (0.1 percentage point) due to increased markon. As of January 30, 2010, Marmaxx’s average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at its distribution centers, were down 10% as compared to these inventory levels at the same time last year. Average per store inventories at January 31, 2009 were down 4% compared to those of the prior year period. As of January 30, 2010, inventory commitments (inventory on hand and merchandise on order) were essentially flat on a per store basis compared to the end of fiscal 2009. We expect to open approximately 53 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2011, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 3%. 27 Table of Contents HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,794.4 $ 1,578.3 $ 1,480.4 Segment profit $ 137.5 $ 42.4 $ 76.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.7 % 2.7 % 5.1 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 9 % (3) % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 323 318 289 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,354 6,248 5,569 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010, driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels, which drove better off-price buying and increased inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3%. Segment margin of 2.7% for fiscal 2009 was down from 5.1% for fiscal 2008. Merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased markdowns and operating costs delevered as a result of the decline in same store sales. In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 9 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 3%. A.J. Wright Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 779.8 $ 677.6 $ 632.7 Segment profit (loss) $ 12.6 $ 2.9 $ (1.8) Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales 1.6 % 0.4 % (0.3) % Percent increase in same store sales 9 % 4 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 150 135 129 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,012 2,680 2,576 A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%. A.J. Wright’s improvement in sales was driven by an increasingly better understanding of its customers’ tastes and shopping habits, which has led to improved merchandising and marketing. Segment profit increased significantly to $12.6 million in fiscal 2010, compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin. Like our other divisions, cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation. A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 7% for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, and segment profit increased to $2.9 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years. In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 8 A.J. Wright stores and increase selling square footage by 6%. 28 Table of Contents International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 2,167.9 $ 2,139.4 $ 2,040.8 Segment profit $ 255.0 $ 236.1 $ 235.1 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 11.8 % 11.0 % 11.5 % Percent increase in same store sales 2 % 3 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 211 202 191 HomeSense 79 75 71 Total 290 277 262 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,847 4,647 4,389 HomeSense 1,527 1,437 1,358 Total 6,374 6,084 5,747 Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense) increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3% in fiscal 2009. Same store sales of juniors, dresses, mens and footwear, as well as HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above the segment average for fiscal 2010. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins. Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. Net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 5% over fiscal 2008. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $68 million. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 5% in fiscal 2008. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008, while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. However, because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In addition, the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by $1 million, in contrast to a $5 million benefit in fiscal 2008, which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for fiscal 2009 reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins. We expect to add a net of 6 stores in Canada in fiscal 2011 and plan to increase selling square footage by 2%. 29 Table of Contents TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 2,275.4 $ 2,242.1 $ 2,216.2 Segment profit $ 164.0 $ 137.6 $ 127.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.2 % 6.1 % 5.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and Poland along with higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation. We are encouraged by the performance of our stores in Germany and Poland and our HomeSense stores in the U.K., but as newer operations, they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland. We also invested in strengthening the shared services infrastructure for our planned European expansion. Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable mark-to-market adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling. Net sales for TJX Europe for fiscal 2009 were up 1% compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 net sales by approximately $282 million. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8% to $137.6 million, and segment margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2009 reflected improved merchandise margins, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in Germany. During fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following the opening of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K. with 7 new stores. As a result of the performance of TJX Europe and the opportunity for off-price retail in Europe, we intend to increase the rate of expansion in Europe. In fiscal 2011, we plan to open a net of 48 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and a net of 6 HomeSense stores in the U.K. for a net total of 54 new stores in Europe. We also plan to expand total TJX Europe selling square footage by 16%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 General corporate expense $ 166.4 $ 140.0 $ 139.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to an $18 million contribution to the 30 Table of Contents TJX Foundation in fiscal 2010 compared to no contribution in fiscal 2009. Additionally, fiscal 2010 had higher performance-based incentive and benefit plan accruals as compared to fiscal 2009, which were partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity. General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,272 million in fiscal 2010, $1,155 million in fiscal 2009 and $1,375 million in fiscal 2008. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflected the effects of the economic recession. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009, reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance-based incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by $220 million as compared to fiscal 2008. Net income and the non-cash impact of depreciation and the sale of Bob’s Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal 2009 (including the benefit of the 53rd week), provided cash of $1,314 million, an increase of $173 million from the adjusted $1,141 million in fiscal 2008. The change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by $132 million, while last year’s deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by $102 million. Deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the non-cash tax benefit of $47 million relating to the establishment of the Computer Intrusion reserve. The favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the Computer Intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it resulted in a use of cash of $210 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a source of cash of $5 million in fiscal 2008. The change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to a change in our buying pattern. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of $203 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected $117 million for the pre-tax reserve established for the Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted cash flows, while fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by $75 million for payments against and adjustments to this reserve. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by $49 million compared to an increase of $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. 31 Table of Contents Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007, as well as certain leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2010 2009 2008 Balance at beginning of year $ 40,564 $ 46,076 $ 57,677 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings 8 (2,908 ) — Other lease related obligations (8 ) 2,908 — Interest accretion 1,761 1,820 1,820 Charges against the reserve: Lease-related obligations (5,891 ) (7,323 ) (11,214 ) Termination benefits and all other (537 ) (9 ) (2,207 ) Balance at end of year $ 35,897 $ 40,564 $ 46,076 The charges against the reserve in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 related primarily to the closed A.J. Wright stores. In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $3 million for exposure to properties related to the sale of Bob’s Stores, which was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The majority of the reserve relates to lease obligations with respect to the closure of the A.J. Wright stores and the sale of Bob’s Stores. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations. The actual net cost of the various lease obligations included in the reserve may differ from our initial estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for other leases from former discontinued operations, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club and 7 additional Bob’s Stores leases, both former TJX businesses. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we currently believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is not probable. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $94 million as of January 30, 2010. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. 32 Table of Contents Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2010 2009 2008 New stores $ 127.8 $ 147.6 $ 120.7 Store renovations and improvements 206.8 264.3 269.8 Office and distribution centers 94.7 171.0 136.5 Capital expenditures $ 429.3 $ 582.9 $ 527.0 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $750 million for fiscal 2011, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. This includes $216 million for new stores, $289 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $245 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to investment in systems, distribution and other infrastructure to support growth as well as an increase in planned store openings, and increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores. Investing activities for fiscal 2010 include the purchase and sale of some short-term investments by TJX Canada, as excess cash was invested in funds with initial maturities greater than three months to enhance investment returns. Investing activities for fiscal 2009 and 2008 also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million versus net cash payments of $13.7 million in fiscal 2008. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $584 million in fiscal 2010, $769 million in fiscal 2009 and $953 million in fiscal 2008. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase programs. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes. Related to this transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009. We spent $950 million in fiscal 2010, $741 million in fiscal 2009 and $950 million in fiscal 2008 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.0 million shares in fiscal 2010, 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008. All shares repurchased were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. During fiscal 2010, we completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in fiscal 2009 and initiated another multi-year repurchase program that had been approved by the Board in September 2009. As of January 30, 2010, $795 million remained available for purchase under the program authorized in September 2009. In February 2010, the Board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. We currently plan to repurchase up to approximately $900 million to $1 billion of our stock in fiscal 2011. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases and execution of Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, market conditions, the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors, and the timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.48 per share in fiscal 2010, $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009 and $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 33 Table of Contents $198 million in fiscal 2010, $177 million in fiscal 2009 and $151 million in fiscal 2008. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.15 per share, effective with the dividend payable in June 2010, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Financing activities also included proceeds of $170 million in fiscal 2010, $142 million in fiscal 2009 and $134 million in fiscal 2008 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. TJX pays six basis points annually on the committed amounts under each of these credit facilities. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding short-term borrowings. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010 and $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 1.01% in fiscal 2010. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, our foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million credit facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit facility. There were no borrowings under the Canadian credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. There were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, TJX Europe had a credit line of £20 million for our European operations. The maximum amount outstanding under this U.K. credit line was £1.9 million in fiscal 2010 and £6.1 million in fiscal 2009. There were no outstanding borrowings on this U.K. credit line at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and other financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 30, 2010, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,135,751 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 85,725 $ 921,438 Operating lease commitments 5,695,061 1,005,366 1,771,055 1,307,773 1,610,867 Capital lease obligation 22,945 3,726 7,809 7,824 3,586 Purchase obligations 2,329,719 2,264,578 62,028 3,113 — Total Obligations $ 9,183,476 $ 3,316,533 $ 1,926,617 $ 1,404,435 $ 2,535,891 The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from purchase obligations long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $254.5 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $151.0 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which 34 Table of Contents are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $181.7 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are continually reviewed and based on historical experience and other factors which we believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long-lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 30, 2010 that the carrying value of our long-lived assets is appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return, and as a result the unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly at the end of fiscal 2009. Despite this, we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009, primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years. In fiscal 2010 we funded our qualified pension plan with $132.7 million and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2011. Share-based compensation: In accordance with U.S. GAAP, TJX estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation expense” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense. 35 Table of Contents Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2008, we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Previously, our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $17.1 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 30, 2010. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which a examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note N to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigations and of the amount of such costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes arising out of the Computer Intrusion and the leases relating to discontinued operations and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessments inherently involve exercises of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, then we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is 36 Table of Contents probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian and European operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases by our operations of goods in currencies that are not their local currencies. As more fully described in Note E to our consolidated financial statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments. During fiscal 2009, we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 30, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 by approximately $42 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable-rate debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of January 30, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. The significant decline in the financial markets over the last several years has impacted the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan.",2023-12-30 18:51:23.839975
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), and the 53-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009). Like most retailers we have a 53-week fiscal year every five to six years. This extra week of sales volume, which also provides a lift to pre-tax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses, impacts comparisons to 52-week fiscal years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2011 include the following: — Same store sales for fiscal 2011 increased 4% over the prior year. This was achieved on top of a 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010. Our strategies of operating with lean inventories and buying close to need, which we managed even more aggressively in fiscal 2010 and continued in fiscal 2011, increased inventory turns and drove continued growth in customer traffic resulting in healthy gains in sales and profitability in both years. — Net sales increased 8% to $21.9 billion for fiscal 2011. Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 4% at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to last fiscal year end. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by one percentage point. — We made the major decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to consolidate the A.J. Wright business by converting 90 stores to other banners and closing the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home office. Although this transaction resulted in significant charges and operating losses to the A.J. Wright segment for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, we believe consolidating the A.J. Wright chain allows us to serve the A.J. Wright customer demographic more efficiently, focus our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger businesses with higher returns and enhance our growth prospects overall. — Our fiscal 2011 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 9.9% compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2010. The fourth quarter results of the A.J. Wright segment decreased our fiscal 2011 pre-tax margin by 0.7 percentage points, which was more than offset by strong merchandise margin growth as well as expense leverage. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2011 improved 0.7 percentage points to 73.1%. Improved merchandise margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales more than offset the negative impact of 0.2 percentage points due to the fourth quarter results of the A.J. Wright segment. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2011 increased by 0.5 percentage points to 16.9%. The fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss negatively impacted the selling, general and administrative ratio by 0.6 percentage points, which was almost entirely offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011. — Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or $3.30 per diluted share, for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share includes the negative impact of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss of $0.21 per share and the benefit of $0.02 per share due to a reduction to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. — During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 27.6 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. — Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 4% at the end of fiscal 2011 versus the prior year end as compared to a decrease of 10% at the end of fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year end. In fiscal 2010 and 2011, we managed inventory levels more aggressively than in prior years, which had a much greater impact on the year over year inventory comparison in fiscal 2010 to the prior year. The fiscal 2011 per-store inventories reflected larger available quantities of end-of-season branded product for future selling seasons based on greater market opportunities in fiscal 2011. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. 21 Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled $21.9 billion, an 8% increase over net sales of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase reflected a 4% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and by 3% in fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year. We expect to end fiscal 2012 with 2,913 stores, which would represent a 2% increase in both our consolidated store base and in our selling square footage. The anticipated growth rate for fiscal 2012 will be negatively impacted by the closing of the 72 A.J. Wright stores that will not be converted to other banners. The 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by continued growth in transactions, with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year. Junior apparel, jewelry and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2011. Geographically, same store sales increases in Canada were in line with the consolidated average while same store sales decreased in Europe. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the West Coast and Southwest above the consolidated average and the Northeast below the consolidated average. The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer transactions at all of our businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction. The increase in customer transactions accelerated during the course of fiscal 2010. Junior apparel, dresses, children’s apparel, footwear, accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010. Geographically, same store sales increases in Europe and Canada trailed the consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West Coast above the average, and New England and Florida below the average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are in at least their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0% Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 73.1 73.8 75.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.9 16.4 16.5 Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related costs (0.1 ) — (0.2) Interest expense, net 0.2 0.2 0.1 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 9.9 % 9.6 % 7.6% * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements we translate the operations of our segments in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in 22 time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by U.S. GAAP, we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.1% in fiscal 2011, 73.8% in fiscal 2010 and 75.9% in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011, the 0.2 percentage point negative impact of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss was more than offset by improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 0.5 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 4% same store sales increase. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53rd week (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in fiscal 2011, 16.4% in fiscal 2010 and 16.5% in fiscal 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the 0.6 percentage point negative effect of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss. Fiscal 2011 selling, general and administrative expenses include impairment charges, severance and termination benefits, lease related obligations and other store closing costs in connection with the A.J. Wright consolidation, which was almost entirely offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs, a reduction in our fiscal 2011 incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011. The improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the increase in performance-based incentive compensation, which increased selling, general and administrative expense ratio by 0.5 percentage points in fiscal 2010. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the Computer Intrusion. We reduced the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by $11.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily as a result of insurance proceeds and adjustments to our remaining reserve. The reserve balance was $17.3 million at January 29, 2011. As an estimate, the reserve is subject to uncertainty, actual costs may vary from the current estimate, however such variations are not expected to be material to our results. 23 Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net amounted to $39.1 million for fiscal 2011, $39.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $14.3 million for fiscal 2009. The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 49,014 $ 49,278 $ 38,123 Capitalized interest — (758 ) (1,647 ) Interest (income) (9,877 ) (9,011 ) (22,185 ) Interest expense, net $ 39,137 $ 39,509 $ 14,291 Gross interest expense and gross interest income for fiscal 2011 were flat to the prior period. Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The 6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 4.20% notes. In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.1% in fiscal 2011, 37.8% in fiscal 2010 and 36.9% in fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and increasing state tax reserves, partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between Canada and the United States (related to our intercompany transfer pricing) and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income. We anticipate an effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2012 comparable to that for fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, a 10% increase over the $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, which in turn was a 33% increase over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009. Comparisons between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are negatively impacted by $86 million for the after tax impact of the A.J. Wright fourth quarter segment loss. Income from continuing operations per share was $3.30 in fiscal 2011, $2.84 in fiscal 2010 and $2.08 in fiscal 2009. Several items, discussed below, affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2011 earnings per share were adversely affected by the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for A.J. Wright, which reduced earnings per share by $0.21 per share, offset in part by a $0.02 per share benefit for the fiscal 2011 reduction in the Provision for the Computer Intrusion related costs. Fiscal 2009 earnings per share reflected an estimated $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009, as well as a $0.04 per share benefit from the fiscal 2009 reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 earnings per share by $0.02 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. When comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009, foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2009. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011; 27.0 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010; and 24.0 million shares at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009. 24 Discontinued operations and net income: The fiscal 2011 net gain from discontinued operations reflects an after-tax benefit of $3.6 million, (which did not impact earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre-tax reduction for the estimated cost of settling lease-related obligations of former businesses. Fiscal 2009 net loss from discontinued operations reflects an after-tax loss of $34 million, or $0.08 per share, on the sale of Bob’s Stores. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $1.3 billion, or $3.30 per share, for fiscal 2011, $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per share, for fiscal 2010 and $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. As of January 29, 2011, we operated five business segments: three in the United States and one in each of Canada and Europe. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and A.J. Wright are each reported as a separate segment. A.J. Wright will cease to be a business segment during fiscal 2012 as a result of its consolidation. TJX’s stores operated in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and StyleSense) are reported as the TJX Canada segment, and TJX’s stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expenses, Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related costs, and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,092.2 $ 13,270.9 $ 12,362.1 Segment profit $ 1,876.0 $ 1,588.5 $ 1,155.8 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.3 % 12.0 % 9.3 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 7 % 0 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 923 890 874 Marshalls 830 813 806 Total Marmaxx 1,753 1,703 1,680 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 21,611 20,890 20,543 Marshalls 20,912 20,513 20,388 Total Marmaxx 42,523 41,403 40,931 Net sales at Marmaxx increased 6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 4%, which was on top of a strong 7% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2011 was driven by continued growth in customer transactions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the value of the average transaction. The growth in customer transactions in fiscal 2011 was on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2010. Same store sales for women’s apparel were above the chain average, with junior apparel particularly strong. Same store sales for men’s apparel were slightly below the chain average. Home categories improved significantly at Marmaxx, with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2011. Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country. Same store sales were strongest in the West Coast and Southwest, while the Northeast trailed the chain average for fiscal 2011. We also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to 13.3% in fiscal 2011 from 12.0% in fiscal 2010. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 0.8 percentage points driven primarily by lower markdowns. In addition, the 4% increase in same 25 store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs which improved by 0.2 percentage points. Segment margin increased to 12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in fiscal 2009. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 2.4 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon. In addition, the 7% increase in same store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. We expect to open approximately 116 new stores (net of closings and including the conversion of 65 A.J. Wright stores) in fiscal 2012, increasing the Marmaxx store base and selling square footage each by 7%. HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 1,958.0 $ 1,794.4 $ 1,578.3 Segment profit $ 186.5 $ 137.5 $ 42.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 9.5 % 7.7 % 2.7 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 6 % 9 % (3) % Stores in operation at end of period 336 323 318 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,619 6,354 6,248 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 9% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011, driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic, compared to a same store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2010. Segment margin of 9.5% was up from 7.7% for fiscal 2010, due to increased merchandise margins, driven by decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 6% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by our continuing to manage this business with much lower inventory levels and increasing inventory turns. HomeGoods’ net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010, driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels, which drove better off-price buying and increased inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. In fiscal 2012, we plan to add a net of 38 HomeGoods stores (including the conversion of 16 A.J. Wright stores) and increase selling square footage by 11%. A.J. Wright In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, TJX announced that it would consolidate its A.J. Wright division by converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods stores and by closing the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home office. TJX commenced the liquidation process in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and 20 stores had been closed as of January 29, 2011. All of the remaining stores ceased operation by February 13, 2011. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 888.4 $ 779.8 $ 677.6 Segment profit (loss) $ (130.0) $ 12.6 $ 2.9 Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales (14.6) % 1.6 % 0.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 9 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 142 150 135 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,874 3,012 2,680 26 A majority of the costs related to the closing of the A.J. Wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter. The operating results of the A.J. Wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of $140.6 million, which includes the following: Fiscal 2011 Dollars in thousands Fourth Quarter Fixed asset impairment charges—Non cash $ 82,589 Severance and termination benefits 25,400 Lease obligations and other closing costs 11,700 Operating losses 20,912 Total segment loss $ 140,601 In the first half of fiscal 2012, TJX will incur additional store closing costs and operating losses due to the completion of the A.J. Wright store closings as well as the costs to convert the A.J. Wright stores to other TJX banners and grand re-opening costs for those stores. TJX estimates that during fiscal 2012, it will incur additional A.J. Wright segment losses of approximately $66 million, primarily relating to the completion of store operations and lease related obligations, and conversion costs and grand re-opening costs of approximately $28 million, which will be reflected in the segments of the new banners into which the stores are converted. The majority of these charges are expected to be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%. Segment profit increased to $12.6 million in fiscal 2010, compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin. Like our other divisions, cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation. International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,510.2 $ 2,167.9 $ 2,139.4 Segment profit $ 352.0 $ 255.0 $ 236.1 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.0 % 11.8 % 11.0 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 215 211 202 HomeSense 82 79 75 Total 297 290 277 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,966 4,847 4,647 HomeSense 1,594 1,527 1,437 Total 6,560 6,374 6,084 Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense) increased 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points, as compared to the same period last year. Same store sales were up 4% in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2010. Same store sales of men’s apparel, dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011. Segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to $352 million compared to $255 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by $25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by $7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. The unfavorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment of our inventory hedges reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. TJX Canada segment margin increased 2.2 percentage 27 points to 14.0% in fiscal 2011, compared to 11.8% in fiscal 2010. The segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins. Net sales increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3% in fiscal 2009. Same store sales of junior apparel, dresses, men’s apparel and footwear, as well as HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above the segment average for fiscal 2010. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins. Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. As of the end of fiscal 2011, we operated three StyleSense stores which are included in the Winners totals in the above table. We are bringing the Marshalls chain to Canada, with six stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2012. We believe that Canada can ultimately support 90 to 100 Marshalls stores. We expect to add a net of 15 stores in Canada in fiscal 2012 (including the Marshalls stores) and plan to increase selling square footage by 5%. TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,493.5 $ 2,275.4 $ 2,242.1 Segment profit $ 75.8 $ 164.0 $ 137.6 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 3.0 % 7.2 % 6.1 % Percent (decrease) increase in same store sales (3) % 5 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results, reducing net sales by $86 million. Same store sales were down 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5% increase in fiscal 2010. Segment profit decreased to $75.8 million for fiscal 2011, and segment profit margin decreased to 3.0%. We believe that execution issues at TJX Europe were the primary reasons for below-plan sales and segment profit. We believe that our expansion in Europe took management’s focus off of the proper execution of the fundamentals of our off-price strategy and that as a result, consumers did not find the values they had come to expect at our stores. This led to same store sales declines, reduced merchandise margins, as a result of increased markdowns, and the de-levering of expenses. We intend to slow store growth for TJX Europe in fiscal 2012 and focus on correcting the execution issues. Despite this setback, we remain confident that Europe holds significant growth potential for TJX. Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2010 to $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009. Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and Poland along with higher accruals for performance- based incentive compensation in fiscal 2010. We also invested in strengthening our shared services infrastructure. 28 Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable mark-to-market adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling. As stated above, we intend to slow our growth in fiscal 2012. We plan to open a net of 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and to expand total TJX Europe selling square footage by 8%. This compares to a net increase of 54 stores and an 18% increase in selling square footage in fiscal 2011. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 General corporate expense $ 168.7 $ 166.4 $ 140.0 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, except for the mark-to-market adjustment on diesel fuel hedges, which is included in cost of sales. Fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year. The slight increase in fiscal 2011 was due to increased investment in corporate systems, management training programs and normal expense growth offsetting the effect of higher charitable donations and incentive compensation incurred in fiscal 2010. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an $18 million contribution to the TJX Foundation in fiscal 2010 and higher performance-based incentive and benefit plan accruals, partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,976 million in fiscal 2011, $2,272 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,155 million in fiscal 2009. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased $295 million compared to fiscal 2010. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,659 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $238 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $48 million in fiscal 2011, compared to a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010. Although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011, our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010. In addition, the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth, as well as a year-end increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows, as compared to fiscal 2010, by $203 million due to the timing of tax payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of $31 million in fiscal 2010. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009, reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance-based incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009. Reserve for obligations of former operations: We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of businesses we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores and A.J. Wright. The 29 majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these businesses. The reserve balance was $54.7 million at January 29, 2011 and $35.9 million at January 30, 2010. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. We may also be contingently liable on up to 13 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and up to seven leases of Bob’s Stores, in addition to those included in the reserve. The reserve for former operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of future liability to us is probable. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them that could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations of (i) leases of former operations not included in our reserve for former operations and (ii) properties of our discontinued operations that we would expect to sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $75 million as of January 29, 2011. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing Activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2011 2010 2009 New stores $ 196.3 $ 127.8 $ 147.6 Store renovations and improvements 301.0 206.8 264.3 Office and distribution centers 209.8 94.7 171.0 Capital expenditures $ 707.1 $ 429.3 $ 582.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $800 million to $825 million for fiscal 2012, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. Fiscal 2012 capital expenditures are expected to include $239 million for new stores, $55 million of which is associated with converting the 90 A.J. Wright stores to other banners. Additionally, $269 million is for our offices and distribution centers to support growth and $317 million is for store renovations. We also purchased short-term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2011, we purchased $120 million of such short-term investments, compared to $279 million in fiscal 2010. Additionally, $180 million of such short-term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2011 compared to $153 million last year. No such short-term investments were held during fiscal 2009. Investing activities for fiscal 2009 also include cash flows associated with net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter of that year. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million. 30 Financing Activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,224 million in fiscal 2011, $584 million in fiscal 2010 and $769 million in fiscal 2009. We spent $1,200 million to repurchase and retire 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2011, $950 million to repurchase and retire 27.0 million shares in fiscal 2010 and $741 million to repurchase and retire 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 under our stock repurchase programs. We record the purchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in September 2009 and initiated another $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in February 2010. As of January 29, 2011, $594 million remained available for purchase under that program, and in February 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2012. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases made directly and under Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including anticipated excess cash flow, liquidity, market conditions, the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change from our plans. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes. Related to this transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.60 per share in fiscal 2011, $0.48 per share in fiscal 2010 and $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $229 million in fiscal 2011, $198 million in fiscal 2010 and $177 million in fiscal 2009. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.19 per share, effective with the dividend payable in June 2011, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $176 million in fiscal 2011, $170 million in fiscal 2010 and $142 million in fiscal 2009. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. As of January 29, 2011, we had a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2013 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. The three-year agreement maturing in May 2013 was entered into in May 2010 to replace a similar agreement that matured at that time. The three-year agreement requires the payment of 17.5 basis points annually on the unused committed amount. The agreement maturing in May 2011 requires the payment of six basis points annually on the committed amount (whether used or unused). Both of these agreements have no compensating balance requirements; contain various covenants, including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings and serve as back up to TJX’s commercial paper program. The availability under our revolving credit facilities was $1 billion at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and we had no borrowings outstanding at those dates under these agreements. We believe existing cash balances, internally-generated funds and our revolving credit facilities will meet our future operating needs. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010. There were no U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, TJX’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit facility. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses. As of January 29, 2011, TJX Europe had a credit line of £20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on this European credit line as of January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010. We believe that internally-generated funds and our current credit facilities will adequately meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and other financing sources. 31 Contractual obligations: As of January 29, 2011, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,092,963 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 485,701 $ 478,674 Operating lease commitments 6,800,093 1,092,709 1,938,020 1,464,690 2,304,674 Capital lease obligation 19,219 3,897 7,824 7,498 — Purchase obligations 2,673,988 2,635,019 34,976 3,993 — Total Obligations $ 10,586,263 $ 3,774,488 $ 2,066,545 $ 1,961,882 $ 2,783,348 The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from purchase obligations long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $209.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $165.3 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $179.8 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long-lived assets: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those 32 assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 29, 2011 that the carrying value of our long-lived assets was appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. When the market performance of our plan assets, discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2011 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $100 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2008, we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Previously, our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $14.2 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 29, 2011. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for former operations: As discussed in Notes B and C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the Computer Intrusion and in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former businesses are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We 33 believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the Computer Intrusion and the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian and European operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 29, 2011, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for fiscal 2011 by approximately $43 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to our maximum variable rate debt outstanding, and to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of January 29, 2011. The analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets can adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan.",2023-12-30 18:51:23.830917

109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains forward-looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1 of this report under the section entitled “Safe Harbor Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.” Results of Operations Overview: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) the Company’s diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.28, which was in the upper end of our planned range. Our strong results helped us to achieve an after-tax return on average shareholders’ equity of 44%. We achieved this performance, despite below plan growth in both same store and total sales, by growing our pre-tax profit margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to sales). The pre-tax profit margin increase was achieved primarily through improvement to our merchandise margins, the result of effective inventory management and merchandising strategies. Pre-tax profit margin also benefited from disciplined expense management and was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 calendar. We continued to grow our business, opening 188 new stores (net of closings) and, excluding the acquisition of Bob’s Stores, increasing our store count 10% to 2,031. Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented chain of 31 stores located in the Northeast United States, was acquired in December 2003, as a platform for future growth. Strong cash flows from operations allowed us to fund our capital expenditure requirements and the Bob’s Stores acquisition, while continuing our stock buyback program. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 27 million shares at a cost of $515 million, which contributed to earnings per share growth. Our ability to continue to report annual earnings per share growth will be driven by revenue growth from our new store openings along with increases in same store sales, maintaining steady profit margins, and the benefit from our share repurchase program. The execution of our buying strategies and disciplined inventory management, leading to rapid inventory turns, are key factors to our continued success. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated. All earnings per share calculations and per share data have been adjusted to give effect for the two-for-one stock split distributed on May 8, 2002. Net sales: Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, totaled $13.3 billion, an 11.2% increase over sales of $12.0 billion for our fiscal year ended January 25, 2003 (fiscal 2003). The net sales for fiscal 2003 represented an 11.9% increase over sales of $10.7 billion for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2002 (fiscal 2002). Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2003 and 2002. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 increased net sales by an estimated 1.5% over fiscal 2003. The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week. Each of these factors includes the favorable effect of changes in the currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx operations. Same store sales in fiscal 2004 benefited approximately 1 1/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. The 11% growth in net sales for the year was less than we had planned, primarily due to lower than expected same store sales. The increase in net sales of 12% in fiscal 2003 includes approximately 9% from new stores and 3% from same store sales growth. Foreign currency exchange rate changes also favorably impacted fiscal 2003 sales growth but to a much lesser extent than the impact in fiscal 2004. New stores are our major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count, excluding Bob’s Stores, increased by 10.2% in fiscal 2004 and 10.7% in fiscal 2003 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage, excluding Bob’s Stores, increased by 9.6% in fiscal 2004 and by 10.1% in fiscal 2003, in each case over the prior year. Our acquisition of Bob’s Stores on December 24, 2003, added 31 units as of the end of 13 Table of Contents fiscal 2004. Net sales for Bob’s Stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition, although the impact on sales growth was not significant. Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in fiscal 2004 (including foreign currency benefit) was less than planned, largely due to the effect of unseasonable weather in the first half of the year. The sales results for fiscal 2003 reflected strong demand for home fashions and were achieved despite a weak economy, geopolitical concerns and a highly promotional retail environment. Same store sales growth in both years was favorably affected by our younger divisions as their share of consolidated results continues to increase. We expect to add 182 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2005, an 8.8% increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8.9%. We have planned a 4% to 5% increase in same store sales and a 13% increase in total sales for fiscal 2005. We estimate that approximately 1% to 1.5% of this sales growth will come from favorable currency exchange rates. We plan on adding or expanding certain departments in many of our stores to help drive our same store sales growth. These initiatives are discussed in more detail below. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and expanded stores are generally classified in the same way as the original store. We believe that the impact of relocated or expanded stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.6 75.8 75.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.2 16.2 15.7 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 8.0 % 7.8 % 8.2 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.6% in fiscal 2004, 75.8% in fiscal 2003 and 75.9% in fiscal 2002. This ratio in fiscal 2004 was better than our plan and reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin, primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004. The improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate .6% reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio. Successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement. The improvement in this ratio in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower-than-planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal 2004 over last year and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. The benefit from the 14 Table of Contents 53rd week in fiscal 2004, which we estimate to be a .2% improvement in this ratio, is reflected in the results discussed above. The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2003 is largely due to the improvement in merchandise margin at Winners, HomeGoods and T.K. Maxx due to reduced markdowns resulting from improved inventory liquidity. These improvements in fiscal 2003 offset an increase in this ratio of approximately .3% at Marmaxx. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx experienced higher distribution costs, store occupancy costs and insurance and employee benefit costs as a percentage of net sales. Marmaxx was also impacted in fiscal 2003 by a less-than-planned sales performance. We anticipate the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2005 will be similar to fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.2% in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and 15.7% in fiscal 2002. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat compared to fiscal 2003 and in line with our plan. Store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 2004 as a result of the levering impact of less-than-planned sales, but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a $16 million litigation charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four California lawsuits that alleged TJX had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime laws. The lawsuits were settled and paid in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than $16 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2003 increased by approximately .3% due to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and increases in store payroll attributable to lower employee turnover. The charge for the California lawsuits in fiscal 2003 increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by .1%. We anticipate this expense ratio to increase in fiscal 2005 by .3% to .4% compared to fiscal 2004. This anticipated increase is largely due to the impact of the planned expansion of certain departments at many of our stores as well as increased costs for medical and retirement benefits. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $27.3 million in fiscal 2004, $25.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $25.6 million in fiscal 2002. Interest income was $6.5 million in fiscal 2004 versus $10.5 million in fiscal 2003 and $15.0 million in fiscal 2002. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2004 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2003 was due to lower interest rates. The decrease in gross interest expense in fiscal 2003 is due to the inclusion in fiscal 2002’s interest expense of amortization of debt expenses relating to the zero coupon convertible notes issued in February 2001 (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements). We expect net interest expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.4% in fiscal 2004, 38.3% in fiscal 2003 and 38.2% in fiscal 2002. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 reflects increases in state income taxes compared to fiscal 2003. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 includes the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split-dollar arrangements as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. This improvement in the effective tax rate was completely offset by the effect of increases in state income tax rates in fiscal 2003. The slight increase in the effective rate for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is due to the impact of a one-time benefit in foreign taxes in fiscal 2002. Based on our operating plans for fiscal 2005 and an anticipated increase in state income taxes, we are planning a tax rate for fiscal 2005 of 38.6%. Income from continuing operations/net income: Income from continuing operations was $658.4 million in fiscal 2004, $578.4 million in fiscal 2003, and $540.4 million in fiscal 2002. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.28 in fiscal 2004, versus 15 Table of Contents $1.08 in fiscal 2003 and $.97 in fiscal 2002. Net income for fiscal 2002 includes an after-tax charge of $40 million, or $.07 per share, due to discontinued operations for contingent lease obligations associated with House2Home, Inc. as described in Note L to the consolidated financial statements. Net income, after reflecting the above item, was $658.4 million, or $1.28 per share, in fiscal 2004, $578.4 million, or $1.08 per share, in fiscal 2003 and $500.4 million, or $.90 per share, in fiscal 2002. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added $.05 to our earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share. The increase in earnings per share, on a percentage basis, in all periods increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2005 with planned spending of $550 million. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense, goodwill amortization (prior to fiscal 2003) and interest. “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes” can be found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements. MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 9,937.2 $ 9,485.6 $ 8,863.1 Segment profit $ 961.6 $ 887.9 $ 893.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.7 % 9.4 % 10.1 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales (1 )% 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,418 1,342 1,269 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 34,101 32,271 30,468 Marmaxx had a 1% same store sales decrease in fiscal 2004, which was below our plan and also below last year’s 2% increase. Despite a below-plan sales performance, Marmaxx segment profit margin was above plan as a result of sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense control. With an expanded distribution capacity, Marmaxx was able to make closer-to-need buys in fiscal 2004, leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin, especially in the second half of the year. The Marmaxx segment profit margin was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 by the 53rd week, as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. We estimate this impact to be .2%. Marmaxx segment profit improvement in fiscal 2004 also reflects the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the $16 million litigation charge. This charge also reduced segment profit margin by .2% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx maintained a liquid inventory position throughout the year, a key factor in this division’s maintaining its merchandise margin in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The overall reduction in segment profit margin for fiscal 2003 reflected increases in insurance and employee benefits, which accounted for a .3% drop in the segment profit margin. Lower-than-planned sales and increased store payroll costs, due in part to lower attrition, also reduced the segment profit margin in fiscal 2003. New stores for Marmaxx in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 performed above expectations. We added a net of 76 new stores in fiscal 2004 and increased total selling square footage by 6%. We expect to open a net of 60 new stores in fiscal 2005, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 4%. We expect to increase our selling square footage by 5%. 16 Table of Contents WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,076.3 $ 793.2 $ 660.9 Segment profit $ 106.7 $ 85.3 $ 59.1 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.9 % 10.8 % 8.9 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 19 % 5 % 1 % Local currency 4 % 5 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 160 146 131 HomeSense 25 15 7 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 3,576 3,261 2,885 HomeSense 468 282 120 Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners and HomeSense increased by 4% in fiscal 2004, slightly less than planned, on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. New stores for Winners and HomeSense performed above expectations in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Segment profit increased 25% in fiscal 2004 versus a 44% increase in fiscal 2003, and was slightly above our plan due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates. We estimate that approximately two-thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Winners and HomeSense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below plan and last year. The reduction in segment profit margin as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects increased markdowns at Winners and the increasing impact of HomeSense on their combined results. HomeSense is at an earlier stage of development and operates with higher expense ratios than does Winners. In fiscal 2003, results were driven by a significant improvement in merchandise margin as a result of better inventory management as well as improved merchandise flow and mix throughout the year. HomeSense net sales were 10% of this group’s total net sales in fiscal 2004 and 7% of total net sales in fiscal 2003. We added 14 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2004, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 14%. In fiscal 2004, Winners also opened its first superstore which combines a Winners store with a HomeSense store. We expect to open 8 Winners and 15 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2005, including seven superstores, increasing our total Canadian store base by 12%, and increasing selling square footage by 13%. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 992.2 $ 720.1 $ 520.5 Segment profit $ 59.1 $ 43.0 $ 13.0 Segment profit as % of net sales 6.0 % 6.0 % 2.5 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 16 % 11 % 1 % Local currency 6 % 5 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period 147 123 101 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,841 2,282 1,852 T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, recorded sales and segment profit that exceeded plan. Same store sales increased 6% in local currency in fiscal 2004, on top of a 5% increase in the 17 Table of Contents prior year. New stores for fiscal 2004 performed above our expectations. Segment profit increased 37% in fiscal 2004, and we estimate that approximately one-quarter of the growth in segment profit during fiscal 2004 resulted from changes in currency exchange rates. The strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxx’s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. In fiscal 2003, segment profit increased 232%, as we saw a significant increase in merchandise margin driven by improvements in inventory management. The growth in segment profit for fiscal 2003 was also favorably impacted by changes in currency exchange rates, which accounted for approximately 10% of the increase in segment profit. We added 24 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2004, and increased selling square footage by 24%. The actual store openings were six fewer than we originally planned, but our increased use of mezzanine selling floors added selling square footage during fiscal 2004 and helped offset the fewer store openings. With mezzanine space, we increase our selling space with little additional rental costs, thus increasing store productivity. We plan to open an additional 25 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2005, and expand selling square footage by 26%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 876.5 $ 705.1 $ 507.2 Segment profit $ 49.8 $ 32.1 $ 3.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 5.7 % 4.6 % 0.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 6 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 182 142 112 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,548 2,830 2,279 HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2004, less than planned, compared to a 6% increase in the prior year. Segment profit increased by 55% in fiscal 2004 to $49.8 million, and was above our plan, despite less-than-planned sales performance. The better-than-plan segment profit reflects HomeGoods’ continued solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies, and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as the business grows. New stores in both fiscal years performed above expectations. In fiscal 2003, segment profit margins were up significantly as we saw improvements in merchandising, inventory management, store operations and distribution. We opened a net of 40 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2004, a 28% increase, and increased selling square footage by 25%. In fiscal 2005, we plan on adding a net of 40 new HomeGoods stores and increasing selling square footage by 20%. A.J. WRIGHT: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 421.6 $ 277.2 $ 157.3 Segment profit (loss) $ 1.7 $ (12.6 ) $ (11.8 ) Percent increase in same store sales 8 % 11 % 18 % Stores in operation at end of period 99 75 45 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,967 1,498 916 A.J. Wright sales were up 52% in fiscal 2004 to $421.6 million, due to an 8% increase in same store sales and 24 new stores. In fiscal 2004, although same store sales were slightly below our plan, total net sales were above plan, reflecting the strong performance of new stores. A.J. Wright achieved a segment profit of $1.7 million in fiscal 2004, which was well ahead of plan and up significantly compared to a segment loss of $12.6 million in fiscal 2003. The improvement in A.J. Wright’s segment profit is primarily the impact of 18 Table of Contents improved merchandising and strong inventory management leading to improved merchandise margins. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 also includes a $1.7 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property. In fiscal 2003, A.J. Wright’s segment loss was impacted, in part, by the unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter in areas of the country where A.J. Wright has a large concentration of stores. A.J. Wright’s aggressive store-opening program for fiscal 2003 also placed strains on this young division and resulted in some execution issues, which negatively impacted the bottom line in fiscal 2003. We added 24 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2004, increasing selling square footage by 31%. In fiscal 2005, we plan to add 32 new stores and increase selling square footage by 31%. BOB’S STORES: On December 24, 2003 we completed the acquisition of Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented casual, family apparel retailer operating 31 stores. The results of Bob’s Stores are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2004, Bob’s Stores contributed $24.1 million to net sales and generated a segment loss of $5 million. We currently operate 31 Bob’s Stores and expect to open 2 additional stores in fiscal 2005. We plan to evaluate and further develop this concept before initiating significant expansion plans. We do not anticipate Bob’s Stores having a significant impact on TJX’s earnings over the next several years. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 78.4 $ 72.8 $ 55.3 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the non-divisional departments for accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the benefit costs of existing retirees and non-operating costs and unusual gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of contributions to The TJX Foundation of $9.8 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, there were no contributions to The TJX Foundation. This increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity. Fiscal 2004 includes approximately $1 million in income due to net foreign exchange gains and losses as compared to approximately $5 million in net charges in fiscal 2003. The majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity. We have not elected hedge accounting for these contracts; thus, the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2004, the unrealized fair value of derivative contracts outstanding has been allocated to the related segments. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 reflects increased costs for retirement and medical benefits of approximately $3 million, as well as a pre-tax charge of approximately $2 million in connection with the transaction terminating split-dollar life insurance policies for two senior executives as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. This pre-tax charge was offset by tax benefits of $3.8 million in the income tax provision. Fiscal 2003 also includes approximately $5 million in net charges due to foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity as compared to a net gain of less than $1 million in fiscal 2002. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $770.5 million in fiscal 2004, $908.6 million in fiscal 2003, and $912.4 million in fiscal 2002. The cash generated from operating activities each fiscal period is largely due to strong operating earnings. The decline in net cash provided from operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily a result of an increase in our inventory (net of related increase in accounts payable) at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to the end of fiscal 2003. Inventories per store at January 31, 2004 were up 11% compared to the prior year, and inventories per store at January 25, 2003 were down 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, inventories per store at January 31, 2004 increased 9% over the prior year. This increase in inventory was attributable in part to our plan to raise the level of store inventories over fiscal 2003 levels. The timing of inventory receipts, in part due to the 53rd week, also contributed to the higher inventory levels at January 31, 2004. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were also impacted by a lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflects reduced accruals for property additions at the end of fiscal 2004 and the payment of the California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The significant cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 is largely due to strong operating earnings along with our liquid inventory position and our buying closer to need. Cash flows for fiscal 2003 also reflect the favorable impact of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses for fiscal 2003 reflects the reserve for the settlement of the California lawsuits, and higher accruals for property additions, payroll and benefits, merchandise credits and occupancy costs. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were favorably impacted by additional deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and due to increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for U.S. income tax purposes. The cash flows from operating activities have been reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $17.5 million in fiscal 2004, $58.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $46.8 million in fiscal 2002. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and $26.0 million of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2002, were made on a voluntary basis. Cash flows from operating activities were also reduced by $37.2 million in fiscal 2004, $32.2 million in fiscal 2003, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2002, for cash expenditures charged against the discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of the former House2Home and Zayre Stores, for which TJX is an original lessee or guarantor. These discontinued operations are being liquidated in bankruptcy by third parties. The reserve activity in prior years also reflects leases of Hit or Miss, another discontinued operation that liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party. The reserve was established at various times subsequent to TJX’s disposition of these businesses, when the companies then owning them suffered significant financial distress. When discontinued operations were sold to third parties, TJX generally remained secondarily liable with respect to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform, unless there are circumstances that terminate or reduce TJX’s potential liability. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX based on potential secondary liability after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. Mitigating factors include assignments to third parties, lease terminations, expirations, subleases, buyouts, modifications and other actions, legal defenses and use by TJX for its store opening program. At January 31, 2004, substantially all of the House2Home, Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss leases that were rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved as a result of negotiated buyouts, assignments to third parties, leasing for TJX’s own use or for sublease and lease expirations. It is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired, but TJX does not expect any such costs to be material. 20 Table of Contents The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below. The addition to the reserve in fiscal 2002 relates to House2Home. The charges against the reserve during fiscal 2004 relate primarily to House2Home and Zayre Stores lease obligations; during fiscal 2003, the charges relate primarily to House2Home lease obligations; and during fiscal 2002, the charges relate primarily to former Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss locations. Fiscal Year Ended January In Thousands 2004 2003 2002 Balance at beginning of year $ 55,361 $ 87,284 $ 25,512 Additions to the reserve — — 66,528 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (37,208 ) (32,189 ) (4,090 ) All other (635 ) 266 (666 ) Balance at end of year $ 17,518 $ 55,361 $ 87,284 We do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve. In addition, we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the House2Home bankruptcy, although the amount has not yet been determined. We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club for which BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on any property we have leased or guaranteed and assigned to third parties without being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned or guaranteed leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $140 million as of January 31, 2004. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. 21 Table of Contents Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2004 2003 New stores $ 164.7 $ 136.5 Store renovations and improvements 147.3 124.3 Office and distribution centers 97.0 135.9 Capital expenditures $ 409.0 $ 396.7 Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 were less than planned primarily due to lower-than-planned spending on office facilities and information systems. We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $500 million for fiscal 2005. This includes $188 million for new stores, $221 million for store renovations and improvements and $91 million for our office and distribution centers. Our planned rate of new store growth per year is in the 8% to 9% range on a consolidated basis for the next several years. Our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 include a net cash outflow of $57.1 million to acquire Bob’s Stores as discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Investing activities for fiscal 2002 include $5.5 million of cash outlays due to advances we made under a construction loan agreement, in connection with the expansion of our leased home office facility. We received repayments under this loan agreement of $606,000 in fiscal 2004, $564,000 in fiscal 2003 and $125,000 in fiscal 2002. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $546.8 million in fiscal 2004, $509.1 million in fiscal 2003, and $99.7 million in fiscal 2002. The majority of this activity relates to our share repurchase program and our long-term borrowings. We spent $520.7 million in fiscal 2004, $481.7 million in fiscal 2003, and $424.2 million in fiscal 2002 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2003, and 26.3 million shares in fiscal 2002. All shares repurchased are retired with the exception of 75,000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003 all of which are held in treasury. During July 2002, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock over several years. Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, as of January 31, 2004, we have repurchased 43.0 million shares at a total cost of $818.6 million. All of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed in May 2002. On February 13, 2001, we issued $517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. The notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the notes are called for redemption, or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. None of these conditions existed as of January 31, 2004, January 25, 2003 or January 26, 2002 and thus the shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations. The holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes in February 2007 and February 2013. We may pay the purchase price in cash, our stock, or a combination of the two. If the holders exercise this option, we expect to fund the payment with cash, financing from our short-term credit facility, new long-term borrowings, or a combination thereof. At the earlier put date of February 13, 2002 no holders exercised the purchase option, and more recently on February 13, 2004, only $3,000 in face value of bonds was put to TJX which were settled in cash. We used the proceeds for our accelerated store roll-out program, investment in our distribution center network, general 22 Table of Contents corporate purposes and our common stock repurchase program. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $15 million in fiscal 2004, and $73,000 in fiscal 2002. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.14 per share in fiscal 2004, $.12 per share in fiscal 2003, and $.09 per share in fiscal 2002. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $68.9 million in fiscal 2004, $60.0 million in fiscal 2003, and $48.3 million in fiscal 2002. Financing activities also include proceeds of $59.2 million in fiscal 2004, $33.9 million in fiscal 2003, and $65.2 million in fiscal 2002 from the exercise of employee stock options. These stock option exercises also provided tax benefits of $13.6 million in fiscal 2004, $11.8 million in fiscal 2003, and $30.6 million in fiscal 2002. These benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million five-year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for $330 million. Effective March 19, 2004, the 364-day agreement was renewed, with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances, however TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we believe that the possibility of non-compliance with these covenants is remote. The revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2004, there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $27 million during fiscal 2004 and $39 million during fiscal 2002. There were no short-term borrowings during fiscal 2003. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 1.09% in fiscal 2004 and 5.32% in fiscal 2002. As of January 31, 2004, we had credit lines totaling C$20 million for our Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line was C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004, C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003 and C$22.6 million in fiscal 2002. The funding requirements of our Canadian operations were largely provided by TJX. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Notes C and G to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt, capital stock transactions and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 31, 2004, we have payments due (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less More Than 1 1-3 3-5 Than 5 Total Year Years Years Years Long-Term Contractual Obligations Long-term debt obligations $ 672,893 $ 5,000 $ 99,981 $ 368,287 $ 199,625 Operating lease commitments 4,314,225 639,669 1,156,120 966,623 1,551,813 Capital lease obligations 45,300 3,726 7,452 7,452 26,670 Purchase obligations 1,620,526 1,598,587 19,926 1,963 50 $ 6,652,944 $ 2,246,982 $ 1,283,479 $ 1,344,325 $ 1,778,158 The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. 23 Table of Contents Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates. Included in long-term liabilities is $106 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years and $78 million for our rental step-up accrual, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. Our long-term liabilities also include our discontinued operations reserve of $17.5 million. We expect a large portion of this reserve will be paid in the next five years as settlements are reached, while a smaller portion will extend beyond five years for those reserve obligations tied to the remaining lease term. Critical Accounting Policies We have the obligation to evaluate and select applicable accounting policies for TJX. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, accounting for taxes and reserves for discontinued operations. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the first-in first-out retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the first-in first-out retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements will likely have some impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results for fiscal 2004. Over time, we have found that actual results involving inventory valuation issues have not varied significantly from our estimates. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent an obligation that will ultimately be settled far in the future and is therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 have been considerably less than our expected returns. These two situations have resulted in a considerable increase in the annual cost of retirement benefits and have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $122.3 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. In addition, 24 Table of Contents during fiscal 2003, we reduced the assumption for the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets to 8% from 9% which increased net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately $2 million. Accounting for taxes: We are continuously under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. Reserves for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by TJX where TJX was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties. These are long-term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (Interpretation No. 46). In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. Interpretation No. 46, as revised, provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities (VIE’s)and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. Interpretation No. 46 was effective immediately for VIE’s created after January 31, 2003. We adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, as revised, as of January 31, 2004. The adoption of this Interpretation had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The provisions of this Statement are effective for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of this Statement are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised Statement requires some additional annual disclosures and makes certain disclosures required for interim reporting. The additional disclosures required annually are included in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. Some of the disclosure requirements of the revised SFAS No. 132 related to foreign plans, interim periods and certain other matters are not effective until fiscal 2005. 25 Table of Contents On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 enacted on December 8, 2003. Specific guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and we will assess the impact of such guidance when it is issued. Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment, intercompany transactions and certain merchandise purchase commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Note D to the consolidated financial statements, on page F-16, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment and certain merchandise commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures, most of which are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing, however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 18:51:25.132776
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1 of this report under the section entitled “Safe Harbor Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.” RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Our financial performance for the 52-week fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005) as compared to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) is summarized below. — Net sales for fiscal 2005 were $14.9 billion, a 12% increase over the 53-week fiscal period last year. — Driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx, our internal combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, consolidated same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2005 over the prior year on a comparable 52-to 52-week basis, with approximately 11/2 percentage points of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx businesses. — We increased our number of stores by 8% in fiscal 2005 ending the fiscal year with 2,224 stores in operation. Selling square footage also grew by 8% in fiscal 2005. — Net income for fiscal 2005 was $664.1 million compared to $658.4 million in the 53-week period last year. Fiscal 2005 net income reflects the impact of a fourth quarter, one-time, non-cash, after-tax charge of $19.3 million, or $.04 per share, relating to lease accounting (see Note A to the consolidated financial statements) while fiscal 2004 includes the benefit of the 53rd week, estimated at $24.0 million (after-tax), or $.05 per share. Excluding these items, net income would be $683.4 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to $634.4 million in fiscal 2004, an 8% increase. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business. — Diluted earnings per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005 as compared to $1.25 per share in the prior year. Excluding the items noted above, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.34 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.20 in fiscal 2004, or an increase of 12%. We believe this presentation reflects our earnings per share on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business. — Our reported operating results led to an after-tax return on average shareholders’ equity of 41% for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. — Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) declined from 8.0% in fiscal 2004 to 7.2% in fiscal 2005. The decline was driven by cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, which increased .7% as a percent of sales over last year, with the cumulative charge for the adjustment of our lease accounting practices amounting to .2% of this increase. In addition, .2% of the increase was due to the favorable impact of the 53rd week on the prior year’s cost of sales ratio. Selling, general and administrative costs were up .1% as a percent of sales in fiscal 2005 over the prior year. — We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 25.1 million of our shares at a cost of $588 million. — Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers were up 1% at the end of fiscal 2005 as compared to the prior year end period. Our liquid inventory position enhances our ability to take advantage of buying opportunities in the marketplace. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated and diluted earnings per share for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the new accounting rules relating to our contingently convertible debt. See Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 totaled $14.9 billion, an 11.9% increase over sales of $13.3 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004. Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2005 and the fiscal year ended January 25, 2003 (fiscal 2003). The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added incremental 14 Table of Contents sales of approximately $200 million, as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003. The net sales for fiscal 2004 of $13.3 billion represented an 11.2% increase over sales of $12.0 billion for our fiscal year ended January 25, 2003. The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004, reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from same store sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of Bob’s Stores, partially offset by approximately a 1% reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004. Bob’s Stores was acquired on December 24, 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include Bob’s Stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005. The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week. Sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. New stores are our major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 7.9% in fiscal 2005 and 10.2% in fiscal 2004 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2005 and 9.6% in fiscal 2004, in each case over the prior year. Bob’s Stores is excluded from fiscal 2004 store count and selling square footage calculations, as it was acquired late in fiscal 2004. Our acquisition of Bob’s Stores on December 24, 2003, added 31 units as of the end of fiscal 2004. Net sales for Bob’s Stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition. We expect to add 161 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), a 7% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8%. Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflect strong demand for jewelry and accessories, women’s apparel and footwear, partially offset by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home fashions. The 5% growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These initiatives were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of unseasonable weather in the first half of that year. Same store sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 benefited by approximately 11/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 76.3 75.6 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.3 16.2 16.2 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income before provision for income taxes 7.2 % 8.0 % 7.8 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 76.3% in fiscal 2005, 75.6% in fiscal 2004 and 75.8% in fiscal 2003. Our consolidated merchandise margin was essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the Marmaxx division continued to effectively execute our merchandising and inventory management strategies, maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need, all of which led to improved 15 Table of Contents merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to a $30.7 million non-cash charge ($19.3 million after-tax) to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” This ratio in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, also reflects an increase of approximately .2% due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004. The balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin, primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004. The improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate .6% reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio. Successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement. The contribution from improved merchandise margin was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower-than-planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period, estimated to be a .2% improvement in this ratio, as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.3% in fiscal 2005 and 16.2% in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a .1% increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of Bob’s Stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results. Bob’s Stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off-price divisions. In comparing fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003, store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased as a result of the delevering impact of less-than-planned sales, but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a pre-tax $16 million litigation charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four California lawsuits that alleged TJX had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime laws. The lawsuits were settled in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than $16 million. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $25.8 million in fiscal 2005, $27.3 million in fiscal 2004 and $25.4 million in fiscal 2003. Interest income was $7.7 million in fiscal 2005, $6.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $10.5 million in fiscal 2003. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2005 and 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.5% in fiscal 2005, 38.4% in fiscal 2004 and 38.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and the increase in this rate in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 were primarily due to increases in state income tax rates. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 also reflects the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split-dollar arrangements as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) enacted on October 22, 2004 will allow companies to repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings of their foreign operations in fiscal 2006 at an effective rate of 5.25%. The Company is evaluating the impact of the act on TJX. Net income: Net income was $664.1 million in fiscal 2005, $658.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $578.4 million in fiscal 2003. Net income per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005, $1.25 in fiscal 2004 and $1.05 in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of retroactive implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that requires the inclusion of shares associated with contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted earnings per share even if the contingencies have not been met. This accounting change had an adverse effect of $.04 on our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 and $.03 on previously reported diluted earnings per share in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Net income for fiscal 2005 includes the after-tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre-tax charge associated with our lease accounting practices, which reduced net income in fiscal 2005 by $19.3 million, or $.04 per share. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added approximately $24 million to net income and $.05 to our 16 Table of Contents earnings per share, and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share in each year. The increase in earnings per share, on a percentage basis in all periods, increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2005 we repurchased 25.1 million shares of our stock at a cost of $588 million and we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2006 with planned purchases of approximately $600 million. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense, net. “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income before provision for income taxes” can be found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 10,489.5 $ 9,937.2 $ 9,485.6 Segment profit $ 1,023.5 $ 961.6 $ 887.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.8 % 9.7 % 9.4 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 4 % (1 )% 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,468 1,418 1,342 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 35,544 34,101 32,271 Marmaxx posted a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005, compared to a 1% decrease in same store sales for fiscal 2004. Same store sales growth was driven by strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, as well as women’s sportswear, with fashion trends in these categories helping to drive customer demand. Sales for men’s apparel and home fashions in fiscal 2005 were soft. Same store sales benefited from the continuation of the Marmaxx program whereby certain departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were expanded. Marmaxx ended fiscal 2005 with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 5 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 5 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2004. These initiatives drove overall sales in the stores with the expanded departments in addition to increasing sales in these categories and were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same stores sales increase in fiscal 2005. Segment profit increased to 9.8% in fiscal 2005 from 9.7% in fiscal 2004, despite the impact of a $16.8 million charge for its share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The lease accounting charge reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by .2%. Marmaxx continued to effectively execute its merchandising and inventory strategies, aggressively managing the liquidity of its inventory and buying and shipping goods close to need, all of which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins. For fiscal 2005, merchandise margins increased .4%. Marmaxx also continued to effectively manage expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period described below. The increase in segment profit and profit margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects Marmaxx’s sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense controls in fiscal 2004. Marmaxx was able to buy closer to need in fiscal 2004, leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin, especially in the second half of the year. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of .2% on the segment profit margin for that year, as the sales volume from this 17 Table of Contents extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. The increase in segment profit and segment profit margin in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 also reflect the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the $16 million litigation charge discussed above. We added a net of 50 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2005 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open a net of 47 new stores in fiscal 2006, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and to increase the selling square footage of the division by 4%. We plan to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in approximately 267 existing T.J. Maxx stores as well as all new T.J. Maxx stores and to add approximately 56 expanded footwear departments in existing and new Marshalls stores. WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,285.4 $ 1,076.3 $ 793.2 Segment profit $ 108.9 $ 106.7 $ 85.3 Segment profit as % of net sales 8.5 % 9.9 % 10.8 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 10 % 19 % 5 % Local currency 4 % 4 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 168 160 146 HomeSense 40 25 15 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 3,811 3,576 3,261 HomeSense 747 468 282 Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, increased by 4% in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a $3.5 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The growth in the Winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over the prior year was due to favorable currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 8.5% was 1.4% below fiscal 2004 segment profit margin, primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which decreased .9% from the prior year, primarily driven by markdowns. Sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half, primarily due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment. This, along with Winners buying based on the strength of its first half sales, resulted in excess inventories, requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year. The lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by .2% with the balance of the segment profit margin reduction coming largely from the increasing impact of HomeSense on the division’s combined results. HomeSense is at an earlier stage of development and therefore operates with higher expense ratios than does Winners. Winners and HomeSense segment profit in fiscal 2004 increased 25% over the segment profit in fiscal 2003. Approximately two-thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Winners and HomeSense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below that of fiscal 2003. This reduction reflects increased markdowns at Winners and the increasing impact of HomeSense on their combined results. We opened 8 Winners stores and 15 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2005, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 13%. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 17 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2006, increasing our total Canadian store base by 10%, and increasing selling square footage by 10%. The store counts include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this division’s superstores which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of January 29, 2005 we operated 11 superstores and expect to have a total of 23 superstores at the end of fiscal 2006. 18 Table of Contents T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,304.4 $ 992.2 $ 720.1 Segment profit $ 70.7 $ 59.1 $ 43.0 Segment profit as % of net sales 5.4 % 6.0 % 6.0 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 16 % 11 % Local currency 3 % 6 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period 170 147 123 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,491 2,841 2,282 T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland had a same store sales increase of 3% (in local currency) in fiscal 2005 on top of a 6% increase in fiscal 2004. T.K. Maxx’s same store sales in fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year. In light of the retail environment under which T.K. Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a $6.5 million charge for T.K. Maxx’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The significant growth in T.K. Maxx’s segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased .6% to 5.4%, primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of .7% as a percentage of sales, of which .5% was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 increased 37% over the segment profit for fiscal 2003 with approximately one-quarter of this growth coming from currency exchange rates. The strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxx’s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. We added 23 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2005, and increased the division’s selling square footage by 23%. Selling square footage was favorably impacted by the addition of mezzanines in some of our existing stores. We plan to open an additional 23 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006, and expand selling square footage by 20%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,012.9 $ 876.5 $ 705.1 Segment profit $ 23.1 $ 49.8 $ 32.1 Segment profit as % of net sales 2.3 % 5.7 % 4.6 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 1 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 216 182 142 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,159 3,548 2,830 HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2005, compared to a 1% increase in fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a $2.2 million charge for HomeGoods’ share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. HomeGoods’ segment profit declined from $49.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $23.1 million in fiscal 2005. The business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to a modest 1% same store sales increase. Consequently, the division took additional markdowns, which contributed to a 1.8% reduction in its merchandise margin. The decline in segment profit margin from 5.7% in fiscal 2004 to 2.3% in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment profit margin was also impacted by a .9% increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (including .2% due to the lease accounting charge) and a .7% increase in distribution center 19 Table of Contents costs as a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio increases reflect the negative impact on expense ratios of a 1% same store sales increase. In fiscal 2004, segment profit increased 55% over the segment profit of fiscal 2003 despite only a modest 1% increase in same store sales in fiscal 2004. HomeGoods’ segment profit margin reflected the solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies in fiscal 2004, and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as the business expanded over fiscal 2003. We opened a net of 34 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2005, a 19% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 17%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add a net of 40 new HomeGoods stores (including freestanding and superstore formats) and increase selling square footage by 19%. A.J. WRIGHT: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 530.6 $ 421.6 $ 277.2 Segment (loss) profit $ (15.0 ) $ 1.7 $ (12.6 ) Segment (loss) profit as % of net sales (2.8 )% .4 % (4.5 )% Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 8 % 11 % Stores in operation at end of period 130 99 75 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,606 1,967 1,498 A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2005 compared to an 8% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wright’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We believe that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors, such as higher energy costs, and that this had an impact on the division’s sales performance in fiscal 2005. We also believe that a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales during the year. These sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflects a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%, primarily due to this higher markdown activity. We believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005, especially later in the year, may have been too aggressive for this young division, and placed a strain on operations. In addition, the lower-than-planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center costs and store payroll. Distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to A.J. Wright’s new distribution facility in Indiana. In fiscal 2004, the improvement in A.J. Wright’s segment profit, as compared to fiscal 2003, was primarily due to the impact of improved merchandising and strong inventory management, which led to improved merchandise margins. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 also included a $1.7 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property. We added 31 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2005, increasing selling square footage by 32%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add 25 new stores and increase selling square footage by 20%. BOB’S STORES: Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bob’s Stores as a TJX division. Bob’s Stores now operates 32 stores and recorded fiscal 2005 sales of $290.6 million and a segment loss of $17.3 million. In fiscal 2005, we built the Bob’s Stores organization and we continued to refine the concept, including repositioning the division’s promotional activity, improving its inventory management, fine tuning its product assortment and testing a smaller store size. For fiscal 2006, we plan to open 5 Bob’s Stores and increase selling square footage by 15%. 20 Table of Contents GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 88.5 $ 78.4 $ 72.8 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the non-divisional departments for accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental audit fees and costs related to the start-up of our e-commerce businesses. This increase was offset in part by a $6.3 million reduction in contributions to The TJX Foundation in fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of contributions to The TJX Foundation of $9.8 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, there were no contributions to The TJX Foundation. This increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity. The majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity. The changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings. In fiscal 2003 and for the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the realized gains or losses on these contracts were allocated to the appropriate division at the time the contracts were settled. Effective with the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004 we began including the unrealized values of these contracts within the individual segments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,079.8 million in fiscal 2005, $770.5 million in fiscal 2004, and $908.6 million in fiscal 2003. The cash generated from operating activities each of these fiscal years is largely due to strong operating earnings. The difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year is largely driven by the change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels. In fiscal 2005 this change in net inventory position resulted in a use of cash of $85.3 million compared to $191.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $40.1 million in fiscal 2003. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, at January 29, 2005 increased only 1% compared to the prior year, whereas inventories per store at January 31, 2004 were up 11% compared to the prior year. This change in net inventory position and the trend in inventory levels per store reflect our decision to raise the level of store inventories in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 levels and to maintain them at fiscal 2004 levels in fiscal 2005. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. This accrual as of January 29, 2005 increased both inventory and accounts payable by $237 million and thus had no impact on cash flow from operations. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2005 were also impacted by a larger increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities than in fiscal 2004, reflecting increased accruals at the end of fiscal 2005 for rent and landlord allowances, property additions, gift cards and payroll. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were impacted by a smaller increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities at the end of fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, reflecting reduced accruals for property additions and the payment of the California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities also reflects cash expenditures of $7.1 million in fiscal 2005, $37.2 million in fiscal 2004, and $32.2 million in fiscal 2003 charged against our discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below. 21 Table of Contents Operating cash flows in fiscal 2005, and to a greater extent in fiscal 2004, were favorably affected by deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for U.S. income tax purposes. Cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $25.0 million in fiscal 2005, $17.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $58.0 million in fiscal 2003. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were made on a voluntary basis. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX businesses that have been sold or spun off. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases when the assignees of the leases filed for bankruptcy, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 29, 2005, substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. It is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or have not expired. We do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve. The reserve balance amounted to $12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and $17.5 million as of January 31, 2004. We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $120 million as of January 29, 2005. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2005 2004 New stores $ 162.6 $ 164.7 Store renovations and improvements 193.7 147.3 Office and distribution centers 72.8 97.0 Capital expenditures $ 429.1 $ 409.0 22 Table of Contents We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $530 million for fiscal 2006. This includes $168 million for new stores, $262 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $100 million for our office and distribution centers. Our planned rate of growth in selling square footage per year is approximately 8%, on a consolidated basis, for the next several years. Our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 includes a net cash outflow of $57.1 million to acquire Bob’s Stores as discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $587.6 million in fiscal 2005, $546.8 million in fiscal 2004, and $509.1 million in fiscal 2003. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $594.6 million in fiscal 2005, $520.7 million in fiscal 2004, and $481.7 million in fiscal 2003 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005, 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2003. All shares repurchased were retired with the exception of 75,000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003, which are held in treasury. During May 2004, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock. Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, as of January 29, 2005, we have repurchased 17.7 million shares at a total cost of $406.6 million under this program. All of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed in May 2002. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $5 million in fiscal 2005, and $15 million in fiscal 2004. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.18 per share in fiscal 2005, $.14 per share in fiscal 2004, and $.12 per share in fiscal 2003. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $83.4 million in fiscal 2005, $68.9 million in fiscal 2004, and $60.0 million in fiscal 2003. Financing activities also include proceeds of $96.9 million in fiscal 2005, $59.2 million in fiscal 2004, and $33.9 million in fiscal 2003 from the exercise of employee stock options. These stock option exercises, along with vesting of restricted stock awards, also provided tax benefits of $20.9 million in fiscal 2005, $13.6 million in fiscal 2004, and $11.8 million in fiscal 2003. These tax benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million five-year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2005 we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for $330 million. Effective March 17, 2005, we extended the 364-day agreement until July 15, 2005, with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. We anticipate that during the year we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity. The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances, however, TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we believe that non-compliance with these covenants is remote. The revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 29, 2005 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $5 million during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004. There were no short-term borrowings during fiscal 2003. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004. As of January 29, 2005, we had credit lines totaling C$20 million for our Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line was C$6.8 million during fiscal 2005, C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004, and C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003. The funding requirements of our Canadian operations were largely provided by TJX. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources. 23 Table of Contents Contractual obligations: As of January 29, 2005, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less More Than 1 1-3 3-5 Than 5 Long-Term Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years Long-term debt obligations $ 675,439 $ 99,995 $ 375,755 $ 199,689 $ - Operating lease commitments 4,840,640 707,676 1,310,903 1,112,675 1,709,386 Capital lease obligations 41,575 3,726 7,452 7,452 22,945 Purchase obligations 1,617,142 1,589,953 26,741 448 - $ 7,174,796 $ 2,401,350 $ 1,720,851 $ 1,320,264 $ 1,732,331 The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements. We excluded long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates. Included in other long-term liabilities is $125.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years and $115.3 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain 24 Table of Contents conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on Bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns. These two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $100.5 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: The nature of our casualty insurance program for certain fiscal periods, primarily fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, carries a deductible that exposes TJX to losses for casualty claims in excess of our estimated annual cost of such losses. The accrual for our estimated losses requires us, with the aid of an actuarial service and based upon claims experience of TJX and other factors, to make significant estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these losses are funded during the policy year, offsetting our estimated loss accruals. The Company has a net accrual of $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty losses as of January 29, 2005. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). This Statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 (our third quarter of fiscal 2006). We disclose the pro forma impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 as originally issued in our notes to the consolidated financial statements and we are still assessing the impact that SFAS No. 123R will have on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these items to be recognized as current-period charges. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have any material impact on our financial statements. 25 Table of Contents On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) enacted on December 8, 2003. We are in the process of determining if our plan is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and our disclosed postretirement medical cost of $6.7 million for fiscal 2005 has not been reduced by any federal subsidy. We do not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be material. MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 26 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:51:11.610077

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.” The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005) and January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 TJX elected to early adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS No. 123(R)), “Share-Based Payment.” This standard requires that the fair value of all stock based awards be reflected in the financial statements based on the fair value of the award. TJX has elected the modified retrospective transition method and accordingly, all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this standard in those periods, based on the pro forma amounts as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2006 Overview: — Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $16.1 billion, an 8% increase over fiscal 2005. — Consolidated same store sales increased 2% in fiscal 2006 over the prior year, with approximately 1/2 percentage point of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates on our Winners and T.K. Maxx businesses. — We increased our number of stores by 7% in fiscal 2006, ending the fiscal year with 2,381 stores in operation. Our selling square footage grew by 8% in fiscal 2006. — Net income for fiscal 2006 was $690.4 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to $609.7 million, or $1.21 per share, last year. Both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on net income and earnings per share. Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $’s EPS $’s EPS Net income as reported $ 690 $ 1.41 $ 610 $ 1.21 Adjusted for: Cumulative lease accounting charge - - 19 .04 Impact of deferred tax liability correction (22 ) (.04 ) - - Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (.10 ) - - Third quarter events * 12 .02 - - Net income as adjusted $ 633 $ 1.29 $ 629 $ 1.25 * The third quarter events include the cost of executive resignation agreements, e-commerce exit costs and operating losses, and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales, partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. — Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) declined from 6.6% in fiscal 2005 to 6.3% in fiscal 2006. The decline was primarily due to the de-levering impact of low single digit same store sales on our expense ratios. — Fourth quarter results for fiscal 2006 were stronger than earlier quarters, with same store sales that increased 3% and pre-tax margins that grew from 6.1% last year to 7.5% this year. Approximately one-half of the pre-tax margin improvement was due to increased gross profit margins and expense leverage during the quarter, with the balance due to the impact on last year’s results of a one-time charge related to lease accounting. We believe that changes initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 to improve execution of our off-price strategies, particularly off-price buying, contributed to our strong fourth quarter results. 15 Table of Contents — We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 25.9 million of our shares at a cost of $600 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. — Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 11% at the end of fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year end period. This decline is largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2006 totaled $16.1 billion, an 8% increase over net sales of $14.9 billion in fiscal 2005. Net sales for fiscal 2005 increased 12% over sales of $13.3 billion for fiscal 2004. Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, which added incremental sales of approximately $200 million in fiscal 2004. The 8% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 includes a 6% increase attributable to new stores and a 2% increase in same store sales. The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from same store sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of Bob’s Stores, partially offset by approximately a 1% reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004. Bob’s Stores was acquired on December 24, 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include Bob’s Stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 7.1% in fiscal 2006 and 7.8% in fiscal 2005 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage increased by 7.7% in fiscal 2006 and 8.2% in fiscal 2005. We expect to add 105 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), a 4% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 5%. Same store sales for fiscal 2006 were driven by strong demand for jewelry, accessories, and footwear, which continued to generate significant increases on top of very strong results last year, as well as improved demand for men’s apparel. The positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and women’s sportswear. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/ accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These stores had same store sales growth which exceeded Marmaxx’s chain average. In the United States, where TJX generates approximately 80% of its sales, same store sales were strong in warm weather regions, particularly Florida, the Southwest and California, while flat to slightly negative in the Midwest and Northeast. Same store sales growth was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately 1/2 a percentage point of growth. Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflected strong demand for jewelry and accessories, women’s apparel and footwear, partially offset by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home fashions. The 5% growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx, our largest division. Marmaxx ended the year with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/ accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments which were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2005 benefited by approximately 11/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year on a comparable 52 week basis. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we 16 Table of Contents believe the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 76.6 76.4 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.9 16.8 16.6 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income before provision for income taxes 6.3 % 6.6 % 7.4 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 76.6% in fiscal 2006, 76.4% in fiscal 2005 and 75.8% in fiscal 2004. This ratio for fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of .5%. The improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions, partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs. In addition, the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a $30.7 million non-cash charge ($19.3 million after-tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting”. This charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased last year’s expense ratio by .2%. These improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de-levering impact of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 reflects consolidated merchandise margins that were essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the Marmaxx division effectively executed its merchandising and inventory management strategies, maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need, all of which led to improved merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to the lease accounting charge. This ratio in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, also reflects an increase of approximately .2% due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004. The balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in fiscal 2006, 16.8% in fiscal 2005 and 16.6% in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006 over the prior year is due to an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the de-levering impact of the low single digit same store sales increase. The increase in this ratio was also negatively impacted by the net impact of third quarter events including the cost of the executive resignation agreements, e-commerce exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by the VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a .1% increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of Bob’s Stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results. Bob’s Stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off-price divisions. In addition, the fiscal 2005 expense ratio compared to fiscal 2004 reflects an increase in stock based compensation. TJX has taken various actions to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 designed to improve profit margins. TJX also revised its approach to long-term compensation in fiscal 2006 by substantially decreasing the number 17 Table of Contents of stock options issued and increasing the long-term cash incentive award opportunities, which is designed to help control the long-term portion of compensation costs going forward. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $29.6 million in fiscal 2006, $25.8 million in fiscal 2005, and $27.3 million in fiscal 2004. Interest income was $9.4 million in fiscal 2006, $7.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.5 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 is due to higher short-term borrowings and interest rates. The higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the Company’s common stock. The additional interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7% unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates. The reduction in net interest expense in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 31.6% in fiscal 2006, 38.3% in fiscal 2005 and 38.2% in fiscal 2004. The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans. We had previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains which are not taxable. The impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of $22 million, or $.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million, $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005. These two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8%. See Note H to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increases in state income tax rates. Net income: Net income was $690.4 million in fiscal 2006, $609.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $609.4 million in fiscal 2004. Net income per share was $1.41 in fiscal 2006, $1.21 in fiscal 2005 and $1.16 in fiscal 2004. Net income for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. Net income for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $.02 per share, due to the third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after-tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e-commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to hurricanes in the third quarter, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Operating losses of the e-commerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005. Net income for fiscal 2005 was reduced by $19.3 million, or $.04 per share, as a result of the after-tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge associated with our lease accounting practices. In fiscal 2004, we estimate that the 53rd week added approximately $24 million to net income and $.05 to our earnings per share. Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share in each year. The change in earnings per share from year to year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006 we repurchased 25.9 million shares of our stock at a cost of $600 million and in fiscal 2005 we repurchased 25.1 million shares at a cost of $588 million. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2007 with planned purchases of approximately $650 million. 18 Table of Contents Trends improved in the fourth quarter, with significant increases in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Reported net income was $288.7 million, up 75% over the prior year, and earnings per share was $.60, up 82% over the prior year. Results for both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter net income and earnings per share: Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $’s EPS $’s EPS Net income as reported $ 289 $ .60 $ 165 $ .33 Adjusted for: Cumulative lease accounting charge - - 19 .04 Impact of deferred tax liability correction (22 ) (.04 ) - - Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (.10 ) - - Net income as adjusted $ 220 $ .46 $ 184 $ .37 Excluding these one-time items, fourth quarter net income was $220 million, up 19% and earnings per share was $.46, up 24%. Results were driven by same store sales growth of 3% as well as by decreases in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales. The reduction in the cost of sales ratio was due to improved merchandise margins, with reduced levels of markdowns at our Winners, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright divisions being the major factors. The reduction in the selling, general and administrative expense ratio was due to a decrease in store payroll and other store costs as a percentage of net sales. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense, net. “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income before provision for income taxes” can be found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” Also, segment profit for the current year and all prior periods include the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Segment profit for fiscal 2006 was positively impacted by the strong fourth quarter, in which every division increased its segment profit, or decreased its segment loss, compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 10,956.8 $ 10,489.5 $ 9,937.2 Segment profit $ 985.4 $ 982.1 $ 922.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.0 % 9.4 % 9.3 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 2 % 4 % (1 )% Stores in operation at end of period 1,514 1,468 1,418 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 36,987 35,544 34,101 Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2006, compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, while same store sales for home fashions and women’s sportswear were below the chain average. Same store sales in fiscal 2005 also reflected strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories as well as women’s sportswear. Same store sales in both years benefited from the continuation of the Marmaxx program whereby certain 19 Table of Contents departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were expanded. Marmaxx ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2005. These initiatives were significant factors in Marmaxx’s overall same store sales results, particularly in fiscal 2005 when sales in the stores with the expanded departments were above the chain average. Geographically in fiscal 2006, Florida, the Southwest and the West Coast all performed above the chain average, while the Northeast and the Midwest performed below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin”) decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the de-levering impact of a 2% same store sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios, primarily occupancy costs (which increased .3% as a percentage of sales) and distribution center costs (which increased .1% as a percentage of sales). In addition, the certain third quarter events described earlier (e-commerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the VISA/ MasterCard settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by .1%. The comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin is favorably impacted by the inclusion in last year’s segment profit of a $16.8 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment, which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by .2%. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs. As of January 28, 2006, average inventories per store were down 10% compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand at the distribution centers. Segment margin increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 despite the impact of the lease accounting charge described above. In fiscal 2005, Marmaxx executed its merchandising and inventory strategies effectively, which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins which increased .4%. Marmaxx also effectively managed expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 are also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of .2% on the segment profit margin for that year, as the sales volume from this extra week helped to lever certain fixed costs. We added a net of 46 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2006 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2007, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 4%. We plan to add approximately 99 expanded jewelry and accessories departments in existing and new T.J. Maxx stores and to add approximately 130 expanded footwear departments in existing and new Marshalls stores. WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,457.7 $ 1,285.4 $ 1,076.3 Segment profit $ 120.3 $ 99.7 $ 98.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 8.3 % 7.8 % 9.2 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 4 % 10 % 19 % Local currency (3 )% 4 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 174 168 160 HomeSense 58 40 25 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,012 3,811 3,576 HomeSense 1,100 747 468 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2006 increased by 13% over fiscal 2005, with approximately half of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) decreased by 3% in fiscal 2006 and increased by 4% in fiscal 2005. Same store sales for fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by a decline 20 Table of Contents in the average unit selling price. Same store sales were also impacted by lower clearance sales volume, primarily in the second half of the year, as Winners’ per-store inventories were significantly below the prior year due to improved inventory management. At the end of fiscal 2006, average per-store inventories were down 6% compared to the prior year. Same store sales were also negatively impacted by declines in the women’s sportswear and home fashion categories. Segment profit margin improved by .5% compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to a 2.9% increase in merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the de-levering impact of the 3% decline in same store sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a 1.4% increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant. Incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also impacted segment profit. The comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a $3.5 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The growth in Winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to favorable currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 7.8% was 1.4% below fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which decreased .9% from the prior year, primarily driven by markdowns. Sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half, due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment. This, combined with Winners’ aggressive buying based on the strength of its first-half sales, resulted in excess inventories, requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year, negatively impacting segment profit margin. The lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by .2% in fiscal 2005. The change in segment profit margin for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by the growth of the Company’s HomeSense business, which is at an earlier stage of development than the core Winners business and therefore operates with higher expense ratios. We added a net of 6 Winners stores and 18 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2006, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 12%. We expect to add a net of 11 Winners and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2007, increasing our total Canadian store base by 9%, and increasing selling square footage by 8%. The store counts include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this division’s superstores which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of January 28, 2006, we operated 22 of these superstores and expect to have a total of 29 superstores at the end of fiscal 2007. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,517.1 $ 1,304.4 $ 992.2 Segment profit $ 69.2 $ 64.0 $ 53.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 4.6 % 4.9 % 5.4 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency (1 )% 14 % 16 % Local currency 1 % 3 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 197 170 147 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,216 3,491 2,841 Net sales in fiscal 2006 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 16% over fiscal 2005. T.K. Maxx had a same store sales increase of 1% (in local currency) in fiscal 2006 on top of a 3% increase in fiscal 2005. T.K. Maxx’s same store sales in fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by a weak retail environment in the United Kingdom, as well as unseasonably warm weather early in the year. Women’s sportswear and footwear categories were below the chain average, while sales of home fashions were strong. Segment profit margin declined .3% to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this division’s share of the 21 Table of Contents cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of $6.5 million. These improvements however, were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent, utilities and property taxes as well as the de-levering impact of a 1% same store sales increase. Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005, despite the low same store sales increase. T.K. Maxx’s operating results for fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year. In light of the retail environment under which T.K. Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2005 include a $6.5 million charge for T.K. Maxx’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The significant growth in T.K. Maxx’s segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased .5% to 4.9%, primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of .7% as a percentage of sales, of which .5% was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge. We added 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 21%. We plan to open an additional 15 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007, and expand selling square footage by 10%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,186.9 $ 1,012.9 $ 876.5 Segment profit $ 28.4 $ 18.1 $ 45.4 Segment profit as % of net sales 2.4 % 1.8 % 5.2 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 1 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 251 216 182 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,859 4,159 3,548 HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Customer transactions and unit sales increased at HomeGoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix. Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from $18.1 million and segment profit margin increased to 2.4% of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of $2.2 million. HomeGoods fourth quarter same store sales and operating results were particularly strong. The strength of HomeGoods fourth quarter more than offset unfavorable factors to segment profit and margin for fiscal 2006, including the de-levering impact of the 1% same store sales increase, e-commerce operating loss of $3.7 million and approximately $2 million of costs related to the planned closing of a distribution center. Segment profit in fiscal 2005 declined to $18.1 million from $45.4 million in the prior year. The business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to a 1% same store sales increase. The business also took additional markdowns, which led to a reduction in its merchandise margin. The decline in segment profit margin from 5.2% in fiscal 2004 to 1.8% in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment profit in fiscal 2005 also included a charge for $2.2 million for HomeGoods’ share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. Segment profit margin was also impacted by increases in occupancy costs and distribution center costs as a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio increases reflect the de-levering impact on expense ratios of a 1% same store sales increase. We opened a net of 35 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2006, a 16% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a net of 10 HomeGoods stores (15 new less 5 closings) and increase selling square footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the pace of store openings for this division. 22 Table of Contents A.J.

Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2006 compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. A.J. Wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to $2.2 million from $19.6 million in fiscal 2005. This improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin, primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006. The comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a $1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories, primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the number of our new store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006 as we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this young division, placing a strain on operations. A.J. Wright’s segment loss grew to $19.6 million in fiscal 2005 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2004. We believe that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors, such as higher energy costs, and that such factors along with a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales in fiscal 2005. These sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflected a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%, primarily due to this higher markdown activity. In addition, the lower-than- planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center costs and store payroll. Distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to A.J. Wright’s new distribution facility in Indiana. Segment loss for fiscal 2005 also included a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wright’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We added 22 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2006, increasing selling square footage by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a net of 8 new stores (10 new stores less 2 closings) and increase selling square footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the pace of new store openings. BOB’S STORES: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 Net sales $ 288.5 $ 290.6 Segment (loss) $ (28.0 ) $ (18.5 ) Segment (loss) as % of net sales (9.7 )% (6.4 )% Stores in operation at end of period 35 32 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,276 1,166 Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bob’s Stores as a TJX division. Bob’s Stores operated 35 stores as of the end of fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns), the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at Bob’s Stores. For fiscal 2007, we plan to open 1 Bob’s store. We are in the process of implementing new strategies for Bob’s with the goal of reducing its segment loss in fiscal 2007. 23 Table of Contents GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 134.1 $ 111.1 $ 99.7 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of exiting the e-commerce business of ($6 million). Both of these items occurred in our third quarter period ended October 29, 2005. In addition, general corporate expense includes a charge ($4 million) in connection with an idle leased facility. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental audit fees and costs related to the start-up of our e-commerce businesses. This increase was offset in part by a $6.3 million reduction in contributions to The TJX Foundation in fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006, $1,076.8 million in fiscal 2005, and $767.9 million in fiscal 2004. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Net income adjusted for non-cash items was essentially the same in each year. The difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year was largely driven by the change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels. In fiscal 2006 this change in net inventory position resulted in a source of cash of $26.2 million compared to a use of cash of $85.3 million in fiscal 2005 and $191.8 million in fiscal 2004. This trend is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year-end period. Average per store inventories at January 28, 2006, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, decreased 11% compared to the prior year and at January 29, 2005 they increased 1% compared to the prior year. This compares to inventories per store at January 31, 2004 that were up 11% compared to the prior year. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. This accrual increased inventory by $341 million as of January 28, 2006 and by $237 million as of January 29, 2005 along with a comparable increase to our accounts payable, and thus had no impact on cash flows from operations. The cash flows from operating activities for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were also impacted by increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities in each year. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased in each year in part due to higher liabilities for rent, gift cards and payroll and benefits. In addition, fiscal 2005 was impacted by an increase in deferred landlord allowances. Cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $40 million in fiscal 2006, $25.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $17.5 million in fiscal 2004. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were made on a voluntary basis. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX businesses. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation of its cost for claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of 24 Table of Contents the leases of these businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 28, 2006, substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. Although TJX’s actual costs with respect to any of these leases may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs related to discontinued operations in excess of the reserve. The reserve balance amounted to $15.0 million as of January 28, 2006, $12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and $17.5 million as of January 31, 2004. During fiscal 2006, TJX received creditor recoveries of $8.5 million, offset by equivalent additions to the reserve to reflect adjustments to the reserve during the year. Any additional creditor recoveries are expected to be immaterial. We may also be contingently liable on up to 18 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $100 million as of January 28, 2006. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2006 2005 New stores $ 171.9 $ 162.6 Store renovations and improvements 267.1 193.7 Office and distribution centers 56.9 72.8 Capital expenditures $ 495.9 $ 429.1 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $395 million for fiscal 2007. This includes $115 million for new stores, $226 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $54 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer new store openings, primarily at HomeGoods, A.J. Wright and T.K. Maxx, as well as lower capital spending across most other areas of our business. 25 Table of Contents Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $503.7 million in fiscal 2006, $584.6 million in fiscal 2005, and $544.3 million in fiscal 2004. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $603.7 million in fiscal 2006, $594.6 million in fiscal 2005, and $520.7 million in fiscal 2004 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006, 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005, and 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004. All shares repurchased were retired. During fiscal 2006, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock. Under the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, we repurchased 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $6.6 million through January 28, 2006. In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million (US$204.4) non-revolving term credit facility, due in January 2009 and guaranteed by TJX. Interest is payable at rates equal to, or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes a fixed rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings to TJX as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006, $5 million in fiscal 2005, and $15 million in fiscal 2004. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.24 per share in fiscal 2006, $.18 per share in fiscal 2005, and $.14 per share in fiscal 2004. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $105.3 million in fiscal 2006, $83.4 million in fiscal 2005, and $68.9 million in fiscal 2004. Financing activities also include proceeds of $102.4 million in fiscal 2006, $96.9 million in fiscal 2005, and $59.2 million in fiscal 2004 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. In May 2005, we entered into a $500 million four-year revolving credit facility and a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility. These arrangements replaced our $370 million five-year revolving credit facility entered into in March 2002 and our $330 million 364-day revolving credit facility, which had been extended through July 15, 2005. The new agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 28, 2006 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $567 million during fiscal 2006, $5 million during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 3.69% in fiscal 2006, 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004. As of January 28, 2006, Winners had credit lines totaling C$20 million, C$10 million to meet certain operating needs and C$10 million letter of credit facility. There were credit lines totaling C$20 million at both January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit lines was C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, C$6.8 million in fiscal 2005, and C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004. As of January 28, 2006, T.K. Maxx had a £2 million credit line to meet certain operating needs. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2006 was £1.7 million on this line. There were no outstanding borrowings on either of these credit lines as of January 28, 2006. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources. 26 Table of Contents Contractual obligations: As of January 28, 2006, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-Term Contractual Obligations Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 884,710 $ 24,231 $ 644,590 $ 215,889 $ - Operating lease commitments 5,035,904 766,622 1,413,553 1,147,319 1,708,410 Capital lease obligations 37,849 3,726 7,452 7,452 19,219 Purchase obligations 1,552,622 1,520,647 26,852 4,963 160 $ 7,511,085 $ 2,315,226 $ 2,092,447 $ 1,375,623 $ 1,727,789 The long-term debt obligations above includes estimated interest costs and assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have a put option available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 28, 2006. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment agreements. We excluded long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which includes $138.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $100 million, the majority of which comes due in fiscal 2010 and $133.2 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the 27 Table of Contents value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on Bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for fiscal 2006 and for several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns. These two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $82.5 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: TJX’s casualty insurance program requires TJX to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If TJX’s estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2006 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2006 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5.5 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. The company has a net accrual of $34.7 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of January 28, 2006. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). TJX adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and elected the modified retrospective transition method. Accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R in amounts equal to the pro forma results presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these items to be recognized as current-period charges. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have any material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of 28 Table of Contents APB 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. We adopted SFAS No. 153 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The Statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period. SFAS No. 154 also strictly defines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (fiscal 2007 for TJX). We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-06, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements” (“EITF 05-06”). EITF 05-06 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements. EITF 05-06 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements’ useful lives, or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. EITF 05-06 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the FASB’s ratification, which was on June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-06 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143)” was issued in March 2005. This Interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when the timing and/or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event. This Interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We have determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of our leased facilities, primarily our distribution centers. The asset retirement obligation and the annual cost reflected in these financials is immaterial. MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. We are also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our revolving credit line, which has variable rate of interest. The impact on our future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 28, 2006, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 28, 2006, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 18:51:18.721927
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2007,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains forward-looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.” The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006) and January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005). In November 2006, we decided to close 34 A.J. Wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain. The following discussion focuses on our results from continuing operations, which excludes the results of these 34 A.J. Wright stores. The cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The closings resulted in an after tax charge of $38 million, or $0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and is discussed in more detail in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and below within the A.J. Wright discussion under “Segment Information.” During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we discovered that we had suffered an unauthorized intrusion into the portion of our computer systems that processes and stores information related to customer transactions. We do not know who took this action, whether there were one or more intruders involved, or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple, separate intrusions (we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively as the “Computer Intrusion”). We have been engaged in an ongoing investigation of the Computer Intrusion and computer security and incident response experts have been engaged to assist in the investigation. We believe customer data was stolen in the Computer Intrusion in 2005 and 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion, enhance computer security and systems, and communicate with customers, as well as technical, legal, and other fees. Beyond this charge, we do not yet have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the Computer Intrusion. Such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. For more information, see Item 1-Business under the caption “Computer Intrusion,” Note B to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion below under the caption “Potential liabilities in connection with Computer Intrusion.” RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2007 Overview: — Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $17.4 billion, a 9% increase over fiscal 2006. — Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2007 over the prior year driven by growth in unit sales and transactions across the majority of our businesses, as well as particularly strong same store sales growth at our international divisions. In addition, approximately one percentage point of this increase came from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates. — We increased our number of stores by 4% in fiscal 2007, ending the fiscal year with 2,466 stores in operation. Our selling square footage grew by 4% in fiscal 2007. — Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $689.8 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, last year. Results for prior years were impacted by certain charges and 25 one-time items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $’s EPS $’s EPS $’s EPS Income from continuing operations, as reported $ 777 $ 1.63 $ 690 $ 1.41 $ 610 $ 1.21 Charges and one-time items: Correction to deferred tax liability - - (22 ) (0.04 ) - - Repatriation income tax benefit - - (47 ) (0.10 ) - - Third quarter events * - - 12 0.02 - - Cumulative lease accounting charge - - - - 19 0.04 Income from continuing operations, as adjusted $ 777 $ 1.63 $ 633 $ 1.29 $ 629 $ 1.25 * The third quarter events for fiscal 2006 include executive resignation agreements of $0.01 per share, e-commerce exit costs and operating losses of $0.01 per share, and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales of $0.01 per share, partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement of ($0.01) per share. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. — During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of cost containment initiatives, we eliminated approximately 250 positions (including 100 open positions) and twelve of our senior executives agreed to 10% base salary reductions. These actions resulted in an estimated annualized savings of approximately $18 million. We incurred a first quarter pre-tax charge in connection with the workforce reduction of $7 million. — Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) improved from 6.3% in fiscal 2006 to 7.2% in fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and expense leverage from our cost containment initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expenses and the costs incurred in connection with the Computer Intrusion. — We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22 million of our shares at a cost of $557 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million which remained in the existing plan at fiscal 2007 year end. As a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion in December 2006, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity. — Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 7% at the end of fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior year end when average per store inventories were down 11%. The increased inventories at fiscal 2007 year end were primarily due to a higher in-stock position on spring transitional goods and an increase in the average unit retail price (“average ticket”). The decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the A.J. Wright store closings to discontinued operations. See Note C to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2007 totaled $17.4 billion, a 9% increase over net sales of $16.0 billion in fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006 increased 7% over net sales of $14.9 billion for fiscal 2005. The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 includes a 5% increase attributable to new stores and a 4% increase in same store sales. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 reflects 5% from new stores and 2% from same store sales. New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 7% in fiscal 2006 over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 8% 26 in fiscal 2006, in each case without adjustment for the A.J. Wright closed stores. Excluding the impact of the A.J. Wright store closings in fiscal 2007, our consolidated store count and total selling square footage each increased by 5% in fiscal 2007. We expect to add 83 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), a 3% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4%. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses (Winners’ same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same store sales increased 9%, both in local currency). Net sales for fiscal 2007 reflect growth in both apparel and home fashions. Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed well while our “soft” home categories (bedding, linens, etc.) were weak. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280. These stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average. During fiscal 2008, we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we plan to add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing stores. In the United States, where TJX generates approximately 80% of its sales, same store sales increased across almost all regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth. Net sales for fiscal 2006 reflected strong demand for jewelry, accessories and footwear, as well as improved demand for men’s apparel. The positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and women’s sportswear. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding jewelry and accessories and footwear departments and ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These stores had same store sales growth which exceeded Marmaxx’s chain average. In the United States, same store sales were strong in warm weather regions, particularly Florida, the Southwest and California, while flat to slightly negative in the Midwest and Northeast. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one-half of a percentage point of growth. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.9 76.6 76.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.9 16.7 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.2 0.2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 7.2 % 6.3 % 6.7 % 27 Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.9% in fiscal 2007, 76.6% in fiscal 2006 and 76.4% in fiscal 2005. This ratio for fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points). Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.5 percentage points. The improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions, partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs. In addition, the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a $30.7 million non-cash charge ($19.3 million after-tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” This charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased that year’s expense ratio by 0.2 percentage points. These improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de-levering impact of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2007, 16.9% in fiscal 2006 and 16.7% in fiscal 2005. The 0.1 percentage point decrease in fiscal 2007 reflects expense leverage across most categories, partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense (0.1 percentage point). The increase in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the de-levering impact of the low single-digit same store sales increase. The increase in this ratio for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was also negatively affected by the net impact of third quarter events including the costs of the executive resignation agreements, e-commerce exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by a VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $15.6 million for fiscal 2007, $29.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $25.8 million in fiscal 2005. Interest income was $23.6 million in fiscal 2007, $9.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $7.7 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net interest expense in fiscal 2007 was due to the increase in interest income. The increase in interest income in fiscal 2007 was driven by higher cash balances and higher rates of return on short term investments. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due to higher short-term borrowings and interest rates. The higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the Company’s common stock. The additional interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7% unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2007, 31.6% in fiscal 2006 and 38.3% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of one-time tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (described in more detail below) which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through July 20, 2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we re-designated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of which are taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006. The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans. We previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains (which are not taxable). The impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains resulted in a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 28 fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million, $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005. These two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $776.8 million in fiscal 2007, $689.8 million in fiscal 2006 and $610.2 million in fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.63 in fiscal 2007, $1.41 in fiscal 2006 and $1.21 in fiscal 2005. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, TJX did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by an after-tax charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $3 million, which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.01 per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. Favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately $0.03 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and approximately $0.01 per share in fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $0.02 per share, due to the third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after-tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e-commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Operating losses of the e-commerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was reduced by $19.3 million, or $0.04 per share, as a result of the after-tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 added approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share. The change in earnings per share from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2007 we repurchased 22.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $557 million, which was less than planned as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion. In fiscal 2006 we repurchased 25.9 million shares at a cost of $600 million. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million remaining in the existing plan. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008 with planned purchases of approximately $900 million. Fourth Quarter Results: Fourth quarter income from continuing operations was $243 million, or $0.51 per share, in fiscal 2007, $287 million, or $0.59 per share, in fiscal 2006 and $165 million, or $0.33 per share, in fiscal 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were impacted by certain charges and one-time items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter income from continuing operations and earnings per share: Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $’s EPS $’s EPS $’s EPS Income from continuing operations, as reported $ 243 $ 0.51 $ 287 $ 0.59 $ 165 $ 0.33 Charges and one-time items: Correction to deferred tax liability - - (22 ) (0.04 ) - - Repatriation income tax benefit - - (47 ) (0.10 ) - - Cumulative lease accounting charge - - - - 19 0.04 Income from continuing operations, as adjusted $ 243 $ 0.51 $ 218 $ 0.45 $ 184 $ 0.37 We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. 29 Excluding these charges and one-time items from fiscal 2006, the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $243 million increased 11% and earnings per share of $0.51 increased 13%. Pre-tax profit margin was 7.5% in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Pre-tax margin improved on the strength of strong same-store sales at Winners, T.K. Maxx and HomeGoods, resulting in expense leverage across most categories. This improvement in the pre-tax margin was offset by costs related to the Computer Intrusion (0.1 percentage point), a planned increase in advertising expense (0.2 percentage points) and an increase in occupancy costs at T.K. Maxx (0.1 percentage point) as well as the year over year decline in A.J. Wright’s and Bob’s Stores’ segment profit margins. Discontinued operations and net income: Our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See “Segment Information — A.J. Wright” below and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Net income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $738 million, or $1.55 per share for fiscal 2007, $690 million, or $1.41 per share for fiscal 2006 and $610 million, or $1.21 per share in fiscal 2005. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense and interest. “Segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes” can be found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments (U.S. dollars in millions): Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.” Marmaxx: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 11,531.8 $ 10,956.8 $ 10,489.5 Segment profit 1,079.3 985.4 982.1 Segment profit as a % of net sales 9.4 % 9.0 % 9.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 2 % 2 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,569 1,514 1,468 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 38,468 36,987 35,544 Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007, consistent with the prior year. Both apparel and home fashions reported same store sales growth in fiscal 2007 with apparel performing slightly better than home fashions. Same store sales of jewelry and accessories and footwear, combined, as well as misses sportswear and dresses were above the chain average. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of expanded footwear stores to 280. During fiscal 2008, we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we will add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing stores. Geographically in fiscal 2007, regions that performed above the chain average were the Southwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin”) increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the fiscal 2007 segment margin was largely driven by 0.2 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, primarily due to lower markdowns, and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives. Additionally, fiscal 2007 includes the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs due to favorable claims experience. These improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increased in marketing costs (0.1 percentage point). As of January 27, 2007, average inventories per store were up 8% compared to a 10% decline at the prior year end. The increase at fiscal 2007 year end was primarily due to our in-stock position on spring transitional goods and 30 an increase in average ticket. The decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. Segment margin decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the de-levering impact of a 2% same store sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios, primarily occupancy costs (which increased 0.3 percentage points) and distribution center costs (which increased 0.1 percentage point). In addition, certain of the third quarter events described above (e-commerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the VISA/MasterCard settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by 0.1 percentage point. The comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin was favorably impacted by the inclusion in fiscal 2005’s segment profit of a $16.8 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment, which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 0.2 percentage points. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs. We added a net of 55 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2007, and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2008, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 3%. Winners and HomeSense: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,740.8 $ 1,457.7 $ 1,285.4 Segment profit 181.9 120.3 99.7 Segment profit as a % of net sales 10.4 % 8.3 % 7.8 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 11 % 4 % 10 % Local currency 5 % (3 )% 4 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 184 174 168 HomeSense 68 58 40 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,214 4,012 3,811 HomeSense 1,280 1,100 747 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2007 increased by 19% over fiscal 2006, with approximately one-third of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in fiscal 2007 and decreased by 3% in fiscal 2006. Same store sales for fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by improved merchandise flow and increased brand penetration. In terms of product categories, same store sales were driven by strong growth in jewelry, footwear and accessories as well as home fashions. HomeSense performed well, favorably impacting this division’s results. Same store sales and operating results for HomeSense were significantly improved over the prior year. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 was up 2.1 percentage points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal 2006. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 improved by 0.5 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to a 2.9 percentage point increase in merchandise margins, which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the de-levering impact of the 3% decline in same store sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a 1.4 percentage point increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant. Incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also adversely affected segment profit. The comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a $3.5 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We added a net of 10 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2007, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 7%. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 3 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2008, increasing our total 31 Canadian store base by 3%, and increasing selling square footage by 3%. The store counts include the Winners and HomeSense portions of this division’s superstores, which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of January 27, 2007 we operated 29 of these superstores. T.K. Maxx: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,864.5 $ 1,517.1 $ 1,304.4 Segment profit 109.3 69.2 64.0 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.9 % 4.6 % 4.9 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 13 % (1 )% 14 % Local currency 9 % 1 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 210 197 170 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,636 4,216 3,491 Net sales in fiscal 2007 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 23% over fiscal 2006, with approximately one-fifth of this growth due to currency exchange rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 9% (in local currency) in fiscal 2007 with growth in both home fashions and most apparel categories. Apparel categories that performed well included dresses, accessories and footwear, while misses sportswear was below the chain average. Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up 0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns), as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales increase. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent, utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 declined 0.3 percentage points to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment profit and segment margin of fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of $6.5 million. These improvements however, were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent, utilities and property taxes as well as the de-levering impact of a 1% same store sales increase. Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005, despite the low same store sales increase. We added a net of 13 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 10%. We plan to open a net of 10 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2008, and expand selling square footage by 7%. Also, we expect to expand into Germany with 5 store openings planned for fiscal 2008. HomeGoods: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,365.1 $ 1,186.9 $ 1,012.9 Segment profit 60.9 28.4 18.1 Segment profit as a % of net sales 4.5 % 2.4 % 1.8 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 1 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 270 251 216 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,181 4,859 4,159 HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007, due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million, and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from the leverage of expenses across most categories, most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses. Additionally, merchandise margin increased 0.4 percentage points primarily due to higher markon. HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2006. Customer transactions and unit sales increased at HomeGoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the 32 average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix. Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from $18.1 million, and segment profit margin increased to 2.4% of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of $2.2 million. We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2007, an 8% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 7%. In fiscal 2008, we plan to add a net of 12 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 5%. A.J. Wright: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 601.8 $ 549.0 $ 477.9 Segment profit (loss) (10.3 ) (3.2 ) (18.8 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (1.7 )% (0.6 )% (3.9 )% Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 3 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 129 152 130 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,577 3,054 2,606 A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2007, consistent with the prior year. A.J. Wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to $10.3 million compared to $3.2 million for the prior year. This decline is primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below-plan sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a plan to reposition this business, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations as described below. By closing these marginally profitable stores, we reduced the number of advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store closings also allow management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining, better performing stores. A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2006, compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. A.J. Wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to $3.2 million from $18.8 million in fiscal 2005. This improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin, primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006. The comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a $1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories, primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the number of our new store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2005 as we believed that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this division, placing a strain on operations. The table above presents A.J. Wright’s operating results from continuing operations. Stores in operation and selling square footage for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include store counts and square footage for the stores that are part of our discontinued operations. As described earlier, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores to be closed as part of our plan to reposition this business. In connection with this action, we incurred an after-tax charge of $38 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. This charge represents costs related to asset impairment, remaining lease liability (net of expected subtenant income), and severance and other costs. We have classified these exit costs, along with operating income or loss related to these stores, as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented. The operating income or loss for each year represents the operating results from store operations, reduced by an allocation of direct and incremental distribution and administrative costs relating to the closed stores. No interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations. The following table presents the net sales and segment profit (loss) of the closed stores in operation for the last three fiscal years which have been reclassified to discontinued operations: 33 Discontinued operations: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 111.8 $ 102.0 $ 52.7 Segment profit (loss) (1.0 ) 1.0 (0.8 ) Closed stores in operation during period 34 33 22 We currently plan to open 5 A. J. Wright stores in fiscal 2008. We continue to believe that A.J. Wright can be a growth vehicle for TJX, with its very sizable target demographic. Bob’s Stores: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 300.6 $ 288.5 $ 290.6 Segment profit (loss) (17.4 ) (28.0 ) (18.5 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (5.8 )% (9.7 )% (6.4 )% Percent increase in same store sales 2 % N/A N/A Stores in operation at end of period 36 35 32 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,306 1,276 1,166 Bob’s Stores’ net sales increased 4% for fiscal 2007, compared to a slight decrease last year. Same store sales increased 2% with our expanded women’s casual sportswear departments performing well. Bob’s Stores reduced its segment losses for the fiscal year due to the sales growth combined with significant improvement in merchandise margins. Merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon, the result of better buying, which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this business. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns) the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at Bob’s Stores. For fiscal 2008, we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business and assess its potential for future growth. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 General corporate expense $ 141.4 $ 134.1 $ 111.1 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Fiscal 2007 included pre-tax charges of approximately $5 million related to the Computer Intrusion, and approximately $5 million related to the corporate division’s cost of the workforce reduction and other termination benefits, while fiscal 2006 included costs of $9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and $6 million of costs to exit the e- commerce business. The increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll, corporate marketing and consulting costs, charitable contributions, and European expansion costs. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of exiting the e-commerce business of ($6 million). Both of these 34 items occurred in our third quarter ended October 29, 2005. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2006 includes a charge ($4 million) in connection with an idle leased facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,195.0 million in fiscal 2007, $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $1,076.8 million in fiscal 2005. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by $ 37.0 million driven by an increase in net income (adjusted for depreciation) of $86.4 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2007, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $151.2 million compared to a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments. These reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 increased by $ 81.2 million compared to operating cash flows for fiscal 2005. Net income (adjusted for depreciation) for fiscal 2006 increased by approximately $116 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a use of cash of $85.3 million in fiscal 2005. These increases in fiscal 2006 operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2005 were offset by the unfavorable cash impact of changes in prepaid expenses and deferred taxes. The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period. Average per store inventories at January 27, 2007, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, increased 7% compared to a decrease of 11% at January 28, 2006. This compares to inventories per store at January 29, 2005 that were up 1% compared to the prior year. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January 27, January 28, January 29, Amounts in Thousands 2007 2006 2005 Balance at beginning of year $ 14,981 $ 12,365 $ 17,518 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings 61,968 - - All other 1,555 8,509 2,254 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (1,696 ) (6,111 ) (7,066 ) Fixed asset write-offs (18,732 ) - - All other (399 ) 218 (341 ) Balance at end of year $ 57,677 $ 14,981 $ 12,365 The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal 2007. All other additions to the reserve are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during each fiscal year relate primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007. 35 Approximately $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 27, 2007, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. The actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although TJX’s actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of this reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club. Potential liabilities in connection with Computer Intrusion We believe that customer information was stolen in the Computer Intrusion in 2005 and 2006 and that such information most likely primarily relates to transactions at our stores (other than Bob’s Stores) during the periods 2003 through June 2004 and mid-May 2006 through mid-December 2006. See Item 1-Business under the caption “Computer Intrusion”. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion, strengthen computer security and systems, and communicate with customers, and for technical, legal and other fees. In addition, various litigation and claims have been (or may be) asserted against us and/or our acquiring banks on behalf of customers (including various putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose transaction information was allegedly compromised by the Computer Intrusion), banks and payment card companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the Computer Intrusion and other related relief (including a putative class action seeking to represent all financial institutions that issued payment cards to our customers used at our stores during the period of the Computer Intrusion) and shareholders. We intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously, although the outcome of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted. In addition, various governmental agencies are investigating the Computer Intrusion, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations as a result of these investigations. Certain banks have sought, and other banks and payment card companies may seek, either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation, payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses that they believe they have incurred by reason of the Computer Intrusion, and payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the Computer Intrusion. We do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate losses that may result from such litigation, claims and investigations. As such, no liability has been recorded as of January 27, 2007. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, claims, litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive and could require us to devote substantial resources and time to defending them. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. 36 We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $105 million as of January 27, 2007. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January 27, January 28, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 New stores $ 123.0 $ 171.9 Store renovations and improvements 190.2 267.1 Office and distribution centers 64.8 56.9 Capital expenditures $ 378.0 $ 495.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $500 million for fiscal 2008, which we expect to pay through internally generated funds. This includes $108 million for new stores, $267 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $125 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx, as well as an increase in capital spending for systems enhancements and improvements to the distribution centers. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $418.0 million in fiscal 2007, $503.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $584.6 million in fiscal 2005. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $557.2 million in fiscal 2007, $603.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $594.6 million in fiscal 2005 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007, 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005. All shares repurchased were retired. Through January 27, 2007, under our current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, we had spent $564 million on the repurchase of 22.3 million shares of TJX common stock. As a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion in December 2006, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million remaining in the existing plan at fiscal 2007 year end. In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million (US$204.4) term credit facility, guaranteed by TJX. This credit facility was originally due in January 2009 and has been extended to January 2010. Interest is payable at rates equal to, or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings to TJX as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006 and $5 million in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2007, there were no scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007, $0.24 per share in fiscal 2006 and $0.18 per share in fiscal 2005. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $122.9 million in fiscal 2007, $105.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $83.4 million in fiscal 2005. Financing activities also 37 included proceeds of $260.2 in fiscal 2007, $102.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $96.9 million in fiscal 2005 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four-year revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five-year revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal 2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These credit facilities have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time. These agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 27, 2007, we had no short-term debt outstanding. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $205 million during fiscal 2007, $567 million during fiscal 2006, and $5 million during fiscal 2005. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007, 3.69% in fiscal 2006 and 2.04% in fiscal 2005. As of January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007, C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, and C$6.8 million in fiscal 2005, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. As of January 27, 2007, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2007 was £10.5 million and there were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at January 27, 2007. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 27, 2007, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 917,027 $ 25,565 $ 450,132 $ - $ 441,330 Operating lease commitments 5,118,104 845,622 1,544,742 1,175,575 1,552,165 Capital lease obligations 34,124 3,726 7,452 7,623 15,323 Purchase obligations 2,037,641 1,946,407 72,912 18,322 - Total obligations $ 8,106,896 $ 2,821,320 $ 2,075,238 $ 1,201,520 $ 2,008,818 The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 27, 2007. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $120.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $100.0 million, the majority of which come 38 due in fiscal 2010, and $142.0 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. Critical Accounting Policies TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, accounting for taxes, reserves for discontinued operations and loss contingencies. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may have some impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: TJX’s casualty insurance program requires TJX to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If TJX’s estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2007 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2007 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. The company has a net accrual of $31.4 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of January 27, 2007. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. 39 Reserves for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by TJX where TJX was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties. These are long-term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur. Loss Contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to TJX but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. TJX’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against TJX or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, TJX’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then TJX will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans -An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R)” (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet; the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost; the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date (the measurement provisions); and disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period. The requirement to recognize the funded status of the plan on the balance sheet is required for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007 and is reflected in our accompanying financial statements. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of initially applying the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 was a reduction, net of taxes, of $5.6 million. The requirement to measure the plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date can be deferred until our fiscal year ending January 2008. The current measurement date of our plans is December 31 and we have elected to defer adopting the measurement provisions until next fiscal year. The impact of applying the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 will not have a material impact on our statement of financial position. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. The Interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. If a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria, FIN 48 requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (fiscal 2008 for the Company). Upon adoption, we anticipate an increase to our reserves for uncertain tax positions. We do not expect that the impact will be material to our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements 40 issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 27, 2007, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings will affect the impact on our future interest expense of future changes in interest rates. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 27, 2007, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Market Risk The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties.",2023-12-30 18:51:24.498519
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.” The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007) and January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006). In November 2006, we announced our decision to close 34 A.J. Wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain. The following discussion reviews our results from continuing operations, which excludes the results of the closed A.J. Wright stores. The cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. All references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (such intrusion or intrusions collectively, the “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of our computer system, which was discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen. See “Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs” below and Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations FISCAL 2008 OVERVIEW: — Net sales for fiscal 2008 were $18.6 billion, a 7% increase over fiscal 2007. — Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted same store sales growth contributing approximately two percentage points to the increase. — We increased both the number of our stores and our selling square footage by 4% in fiscal 2008. We ended the fiscal year with 2,563 stores in operation. — The fiscal 2008 results reflect pre-tax charges of $197.0 million with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including pre-tax costs of $37.8 million we expensed as incurred in the first six months and a $159.2 million charge for a pre-tax reserve for estimated losses thereafter. — Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) declined from 7.2% in fiscal 2007 to 6.7% in fiscal 2008. The Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs, which reduced our pre-tax margin by 1.0% for fiscal 2008, more than offset what would otherwise have been an increase in our pre-tax margin. — Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $771.8 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, last year. Fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations was reduced by $119 million, or $0.25 per share, for the after-tax impact of the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. Fiscal 2007 income from continuing operations was reduced by $3 million for such costs, which did not change the fiscal 2007 earnings per share. — We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. — Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 2% at the end of fiscal 2008 as compared to an increase of 7% for the prior year end. The following is a summary of our operating results at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the A.J. Wright store closings to discontinued operations. See also Note C to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2008 totaled $18.6 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $17.4 billion in fiscal 2007. Net sales for fiscal 2007 increased 9% over net sales of $16.0 billion for fiscal 2006. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects a 3% increase from new stores and a 4% increase in same store sales. The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 reflects increases of 5% from new stores and 4% from same store sales. 17 Table of Contents New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 4% in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2008 and 5% in fiscal 2007. We expect to add 109 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), a 4% increase in our consolidated store base. We also expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4%. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international businesses as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately two percentage points of growth. At our domestic divisions, sales of dresses, footwear and accessories were strong, partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the women’s apparel category. Home categories at Marmaxx, our largest division, were also weak. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we rolled out expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 Marshalls stores and plan to continue this expansion in approximately 200 Marshalls stores in fiscal 2009, bringing the total to approximately 720. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international businesses were above the consolidated average. Within the U. S., the strongest regions were the West coast and the Northeast, while Florida and the Southeast trailed the U.S. average. Overall transaction volume was slightly down, more than offset by an increase in the average ticket. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses (Winners’ same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same store sales increased 6%, both in local currency). Net sales for fiscal 2007 reflected growth in both apparel and home fashions. Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed well while our “soft” home categories (bedding, linens, etc.) did not perform to our expectations. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280. These stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments at year end. In the U. S., same store sales increased across almost all regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.5 75.9 76.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.8 16.9 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs 1.0 - - Interest (income) expense, net - 0.1 0.2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 6.7 % 7.2 % 6.3 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.5% in fiscal 2008, 75.9% in fiscal 2007 and 76.6% in fiscal 2006. This ratio for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.5 percentage points), due to improved markon and lower markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our off-price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise margin improvement was partially 18 Table of Contents offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period last year. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal 2006 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points). Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and was 16.9% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2008 expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs (0.1 percentage point) and a fourth quarter impairment charge at our Bob’s Stores division (0.1 percentage point) being offset by our continuing cost containment initiatives. The decrease in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflects expense leverage across most categories, partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense (0.1 percentage point). Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: We face potential liabilities and costs as a result of claims, litigation and investigations with respect to the Computer Intrusion. During the first six months of fiscal 2008, we expensed pre-tax costs of $37.8 million for costs we incurred related to the Computer Intrusion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we were able to reasonably estimate our potential losses related to the Computer Intrusion and, accordingly, established a pre-tax reserve of $178.1 million and recorded a pre-tax charge in that amount. Subsequently, as previously disclosed, we settled the purported customer class actions (subject to final court approval), settled claims of Visa USA, Visa Inc. and substantially all U.S. Visa issuers and settled with most of the named plaintiffs in the purported financial institution class action. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reduced our reserve and the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by $18.9 million as a result of insurance proceeds with respect to the Computer Intrusion, which had not previously been reflected in the reserve, as well as a reduction in our estimated legal and other fees as we have continued to resolve outstanding disputes, litigation and investigations. As of January 26, 2008, our reserve balance was $117.3 million reflecting amounts paid for settlements (primarily the Visa settlement), legal and other fees. Our reserve reflects our current estimation of probable losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the Computer Intrusion and includes our current estimation of total potential cash liabilities, from pending litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as well as legal and other costs and expenses, arising from the Computer Intrusion. In addition, we expect to record non-cash costs with respect to the customer class actions settlement, if finally approved, when incurred, which we do not expect to be material to our financial statements. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims and investigations and related expenses and for other changes in our estimates. Interest (income) expense, net: Interest (income) expense, net amounted to income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008, expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007 and expense of $29.6 million in fiscal 2006. These changes were the result of interest income totaling $40.7 million in the fiscal 2008 versus $23.6 million for fiscal 2007 and $9.4 million in fiscal 2006. The additional interest income in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, as well as fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006, was due to higher cash balances available for investment, as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.9% in fiscal 2008, 37.7% in fiscal 2007 and 31.6% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 one-time benefits as well as an increase due to certain FIN 48 tax positions, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits. During fiscal 2008, we changed our assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of one of our Puerto Rican subsidiaries. Beginning in fiscal 2008’s third quarter, we concluded that the undistributed earnings of our Puerto Rican subsidiary that operates Marshalls stores would not be permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of the undistributed income and, in addition, we were able to fully recognize the benefit of accumulated foreign tax credits that had been earned at the subsidiary level. The net impact of this change in assertion was a reduction in our effective income tax rate of 0.4 percentage points. Prior to this period, the earnings of this Puerto Rican subsidiary were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of one-time tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (benefit for repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary and the correction of accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans) which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through July 20, 19 Table of Contents 2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we re-designated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of which is taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $771.8 million in fiscal 2008, $776.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $689.8 million in fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.66 in fiscal 2008, $1.63 in fiscal 2007 and $1.41 in fiscal 2006. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $119 million, after tax, which reduced earnings per share by $0.25 per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $3 million, after tax, which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.01 per share but did not change full year earnings per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. In addition, income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $0.02 per share, due to certain third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after-tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e-commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately $0.05 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2008 and approximately $0.03 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007. In addition, the change in earnings per share in each fiscal year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 33.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $950 million. In fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $557 million, which was less than planned, as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009 with planned purchases of approximately $900 million. Discontinued operations and net income: Our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See “Segment Information — A.J. Wright” below and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Net income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share for fiscal 2008, $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share for fiscal 2007 and $690.4 million, or $1.41 per share for fiscal 2006. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 20 Table of Contents operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments (U.S. dollars in millions): MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 11,966.7 $ 11,531.8 $ 10,956.8 Segment profit $ 1,158.2 $ 1,079.3 $ 985.4 Segment profit as a % of net sales 9.7 % 9.4 % 9.0 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 2 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,623 1,569 1,514 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 39,784 38,468 36,987 Marmaxx, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains, posted a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008 compared to a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2008 reflected strong same store sales increases in less weather-sensitive categories such as dresses, footwear and accessories. During fiscal 2008, we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 240 Marshalls stores and plan to add expanded departments to an additional 200 stores in fiscal 2009, taking the total to approximately 720. Home categories at Marmaxx underperformed in fiscal 2008 and we have taken measures to improve in this area of our execution. Geographically in fiscal 2008, same store sales for the Northeast, Southwest and West Coast were above the chain average, while same store sales in Florida and the Midwest were below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to 9.7% in fiscal 2008 from 9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins, which increased 0.4 percentage points (as a percentage of net sales) due to lower markdowns and a higher markon, as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures. These improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increase in advertising expense (0.1 percentage point). As of January 26, 2008, average inventories per store were down 2% compared to an 8% increase at the prior year end. The increase at the prior year end was primarily due to our in-stock position on spring transitional goods and an increase in average ticket. Segment margin increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in fiscal 2006. The increase was largely driven by a 0.2 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, primarily due to lower markdowns, and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives. Additionally, fiscal 2007 included the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs of favorable claims experience. These improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increase in marketing costs (0.1 percentage point). We added a net of 54 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2008, and increased total selling square footage of the division by 3%. We expect to open approximately 45 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2009, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 2%. 21 Table of Contents WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 2,040.8 $ 1,740.8 $ 1,457.7 Segment profit $ 235.1 $ 181.9 $ 120.3 Segment profit as a % of net sales 11.5 % 10.4 % 8.3 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 11 % 4 % Local currency 5 % 5 % (3 )% Stores in operation at end of period Winners 191 184 174 HomeSense 71 68 58 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,389 4,214 4,012 HomeSense 1,358 1,280 1,100 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2008 increased by 17% over fiscal 2007, with approximately one-half of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 were positively impacted by sales of home fashions, footwear, jewelry and accessories. HomeSense continued to perform well, favorably impacting same store sales in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately $24 million for fiscal 2008. Most of this increase is due to currency translation, which also impacts sales growth and, therefore, has no impact on segment margin. The increase in segment profit due to currency exchange rates also included the favorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory hedge contracts which increased segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. The inventory hedge contracts are designed to lock in the cost of merchandise purchases that are denominated in U.S. dollars. The fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin, primarily due to increased markon as well the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 increased 2.1 percentage points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal 2006. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. We added a net of 7 Winners stores and 3 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2008, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 5%. We expect to add a net of 9 Winners and 4 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we plan to test a new off-price concept with 3 new stores in Canada in fiscal 2009, which will bring our total Canadian store base up by 5%, and increase selling square footage by 6%. The store counts include the Winners and HomeSense portions of this division’s superstores, which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of January 26, 2008 we operated 30 of these superstores. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 2,216.2 $ 1,864.5 $ 1,517.1 Segment profit $ 127.2 $ 109.3 $ 69.2 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.7 % 5.9 % 4.6 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 13 % (1 )% Local currency 6 % 9 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 226 210 197 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,096 4,636 4,216 22 Table of Contents Net sales for fiscal 2008 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, increased by 19% over fiscal 2007, with approximately 40% of this growth due to currency exchange rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 6% (in local currency) for fiscal 2008. Same store sales for home fashions, footwear, accessories and dresses performed above the chain average, while other apparel categories were generally below the chain average. Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to 5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted segment profit by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment profit margin. During fiscal 2008, T.K. Maxx opened its first 5 stores in Germany which reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by $11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 0.6 percentage points. The T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland increased segment margin for fiscal 2008 by 0.4 percentage points, which reflected a slightly improved merchandise margin, as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the division’s cost containment efforts. Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up 0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns), as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales increase. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent, utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations. We added a net of 16 T.K. Maxx stores, including 5 in Germany, in fiscal 2008 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 10%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to open a net of 15 T.K. Maxx stores, including another 5 in Germany and expect to introduce the HomeSense concept in Europe with a planned opening of 5 such stores. Overall we expect to expand selling square footage by 9%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 1,480.4 $ 1,365.1 $ 1,186.9 Segment profit $ 76.2 $ 60.9 $ 28.4 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.1 % 4.5 % 2.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 4 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 289 270 251 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,569 5,181 4,859 HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. We attribute this division’s strong performance to solid execution of off-price buying and flow of product. HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007 due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million, and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from leveraging expenses across most categories, most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses. We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2008, a 7% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 7%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to add a net of 25 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 9%. A.J. WRIGHT*: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 632.7 $ 601.8 $ 549.0 Segment profit (loss) $ (1.8 ) $ (10.3 ) $ (3.2 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (0.3 )% (1.7 )% (0.6 )% Percent increase in same store sales 2 % 3 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period** 129 129 119 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands)** 2,576 2,577 2,377 23 Table of Contents * The table above presents A.J. Wright’s operating results from continuing operations. The operating results of the stores classified as discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were immaterial. ** Stores in operation and square footage for fiscal 2006 have been adjusted for store closings accounted for as discontinued operations. A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal 2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives. A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2007, and segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to $10.3 million. This decline, compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below-plan sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a plan to reposition this business, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations. By closing these marginally profitable stores, we reduced the number of advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store closings also allowed management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining, better performing stores. We currently plan to add a net of 5 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2009. We continue to believe that A.J. Wright can be a growth vehicle for TJX, with its very sizable target customer demographic. BOB’S STORES: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 310.4 $ 300.6 $ 288.5 Segment profit (loss) $ (17.4 ) $ (17.4 ) $ (28.0 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (5.6 )% (5.8 )% (9.7 )% Percent increase in same store sales 5 % 2 % N/A Stores in operation at end of period 34 36 35 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,242 1,306 1,276 Bob’s Stores’ net sales increased 3% for fiscal 2008, and same store sales increased 5%, with footwear performing well. Bob’s Stores segment loss for fiscal 2008 was flat compared to the prior year. Merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon, the result of better buying, which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this division. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $8 million. The impairment charge related to certain long lived assets and intangible assets at Bob’s Stores and represented the excess of recorded carrying values over the estimated fair value of these assets. For fiscal 2009, we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 General corporate expense $ 139.4 $ 136.4 $ 134.1 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level. In comparing general corporate expense for fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 included the $5 million charge referred to above, while fiscal 2006 included costs of $9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and $6 million of 24 Table of Contents costs to exit the e-commerce business. The increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll, corporate marketing and consulting costs, charitable contributions, and European expansion costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,361.1 million in fiscal 2008, $1,195.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by $166.1 million. Net income (adjusted for depreciation and amortization) for fiscal 2008 increased $50.0 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, favorably impacted operating cash flows by $4.9 million compared to a use of cash of $151.2 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable. These increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision, changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by $37.0 million compared to fiscal 2006, driven by an increase in net income (adjusted for depreciation and amortization) of $86.4 million. In fiscal 2007, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $151.2 million compared to a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments. These reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period. Average per store inventories at January 26, 2008, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, increased 2% compared to an increase of 7% at January 27, 2007. This compares to inventories per store at January 28, 2006 that were down 11% compared to the prior year. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2008 2007 2006 Balance at beginning of year $ 57,677 $ 14,981 $ 12,365 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings — 61,968 — Other lease related obligations — 1,555 8,509 Interest accretion 1,820 400 400 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (11,214 ) (1,696 ) (6,111 ) Fixed asset write-off (non-cash) — (18,732 ) — Termination benefits and all other (2,207 ) (799 ) (182 ) Balance at end of year $ 46,076 $ 57,677 $ 14,981 The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal 2007. The other additions to the reserve for lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 relate primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007. 25 Table of Contents Approximately $32 million of the fiscal 2008 reserve balance and $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 26, 2008, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $105 million as of January 26, 2008. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2008 2007 2006 New stores $ 120.7 $ 123.0 $ 171.9 Store renovations and improvements 269.8 190.2 267.1 Office and distribution centers 136.5 64.8 56.9 Capital expenditures $ 527.0 $ 378.0 $ 495.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $575 million for fiscal 2009, which we expect to pay through internally generated funds. This includes $140 million for new stores, $288 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $147 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $952.7 million in fiscal 2008, $418.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $503.7 million in fiscal 2006. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. 26 Table of Contents We spent $950.2 million in fiscal 2008, $557.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $600.0 million in fiscal 2006 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008, 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007 and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006. All shares repurchased were retired. Repurchases were suspended late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and for most of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as a result of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. Of the $950.2 million of repurchases made during fiscal 2008, $436.2 million completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program initially authorized in October 2005 and $514.0 million were made under the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized in January 2007. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an additional multi-year stock repurchase plan of $1 billion. In January 2006, we entered into a C$235 million term credit facility (through our Canadian division, Winners) due in January 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or less than Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian division as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, there were no scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008, $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007 and $0.24 per share in fiscal 2006. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $151.5 million in fiscal 2008, $122.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $105.3 million in fiscal 2006. Financing activities also included proceeds of $134.1 million in fiscal 2008, $260.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $102.4 million in fiscal 2006 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four-year revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five-year revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal 2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time. The revolving credit facilities are used as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 26, 2008, there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. There were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $205 million during fiscal 2007 and $567 million during fiscal 2006. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007 and 3.69% in fiscal 2006. As of January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008, C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007 and C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. As of January 26, 2008, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2008 was £16.4 million, and there were no outstanding borrowings at January 26, 2008 or January 27, 2007. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 26, 2008, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 928,130 $ 26,840 $ 459,960 $ — $ 441,330 Operating lease commitments 5,661,698 943,174 1,707,955 1,295,248 1,715,321 Capital lease obligations 30,071 3,726 7,452 7,809 11,084 Purchase obligations 2,074,958 1,992,773 78,335 2,150 1,700 Total Obligations $ 8,694,857 $ 2,966,513 $ 2,253,702 $ 1,305,207 $ 2,169,435 27 Table of Contents The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 26, 2008. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2008. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $125.4 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $143.1 million, the majority of which come due in fiscal 2010, $150.5 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and $269.2 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may have some impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Impairment of long-lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable. Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of 28 Table of Contents retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: In July 2007 we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 requires us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgements and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2008 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2008 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 26, 2008. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several refund claims have been approved by IRS Appeals Office and are awaiting confirmation by the Congressional Joint Tax Committee. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make numerous estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and the related costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigation and related costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long-term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligation under the leases, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist with regard to any liability. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions. Loss Contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose fair value measurements according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category 29 Table of Contents of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that will (1) partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (2) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different fair value measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years and will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 26, 2008, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during fiscal 2008. As of January 26, 2008, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Market Risk The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. As such it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term and such changes could affect the amounts reported.",2023-12-30 18:51:22.156246
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), and the fiscal years ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008) and January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), each of which included 52 weeks. Our results reflect two discontinued operations: Bob’s Stores, sold in fiscal 2009 and 34 A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2007 as part of a repositioning of the chain. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements. All references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. Our results reflect the costs of the unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (collectively, the “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of our computer system, which was discovered in late fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen. See “Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs” below. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal 2009 performance was adversely affected in the second half of the year by two macroeconomic factors: the worldwide recession which adversely affected consumer spending and retail sales at TJX and generally and the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the British pound, which adversely affected the translation of the operating results of our Canadian and European businesses. With the flexibility of our off-price business model, in fiscal 2009 we increased our inventory turns and maintained the value proposition of our merchandise by buying closer to need and operating with leaner-than-usual inventories. We also continued a focus on tight expense control during fiscal 2009. Despite the challenging environment, customer traffic in fiscal 2009 was up across virtually all of our divisions, and merchandise margins remained strong. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2009 include the following: — Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $19.0 billion, a 4% increase over fiscal 2008. The 53rd week in fiscal 2009 increased net sales by approximately 1%, which was more than offset by a 2% decline in net sales due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We continued to grow our business, with both stores in operation and selling square footage up 5% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to last fiscal year end. — Same store sales on a 52-week basis for fiscal 2009 increased 1% over the prior year. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2009 increased 0.3 percentage points, as an increase in merchandise margins and the benefit of the 53rd week were more than offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage on a 1% same store sales increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 0.1 percentage points compared to the prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the 1% same store sales increase. — Our fiscal 2009 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 7.6% compared to 6.9% for fiscal 2008. The comparison of pre-tax margins for fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 was affected by the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in each year. Fiscal 2009 included a $31 million credit (pre-tax) to the provision, which increased pre-tax margin by 0.2 percentage points, while fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax charge of $197 million, which reduced the fiscal 2008 pre-tax margin by 1.1 percentage points. — Income from continuing operations was $914.9 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009 compared to $782.4 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, last year. The fiscal 2009 credit to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs increased fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations by $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, while the fiscal 2008 charge for the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs reduced fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations by $119 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. — During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 24.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $741 million. Our diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of our stock repurchase program. — Consolidated average per store inventories of our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 6% at the end of fiscal 2009 as compared to an increase of 2% at the prior year 22 Table of Contents end. On a comparable basis, adjusting for currency and a calendar shift due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2009, average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and were essentially flat in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. We have implemented steps to position ourselves for the fiscal year ending January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010) in light of the ongoing worldwide recession including: — We have planned our consolidated same store sales conservatively, setting our inventory and expense plans around negative low single digit comparable store sales. — We plan to continue to operate with historically lean inventories and to buy closer to need than in the past, designed to increase inventory turns and drive traffic to our stores. — We are taking measures designed to reduce expenses in fiscal 2010 by up to $150 million including further savings in non-merchandise procurement, implementing processes to more efficiently manage payroll in our store and distribution centers, reducing marketing expenditures while increasing penetration, eliminating open positions, eliminating merit pay increases across the majority of the organization, restructuring certain areas to improve productivity and efficiency and offering a voluntary retirement program for certain employees. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 totaled $19.0 billion, a 4% increase over net sales of $18.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 1% increase from the 53rd week and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 7% over net sales of $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase reflected increases of 3% from new stores, 2% from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 and by 4% in fiscal 2008 over the respective prior year periods. As a result of economic conditions, we have planned store openings more conservatively and expect to add 64 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2010, a 2% increase in our consolidated store base and an increase of 2% in our selling square footage. The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance, especially at our international segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession. Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, which was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction. As for merchandise categories, shoes, accessories and dresses were the strongest performers, while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions. Geographically, same store sales in Canada and the United Kingdom were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and Florida trailed the consolidated average. The 2% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international segments. In the U.S., sales of dresses, footwear and accessories were strong, partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the women’s apparel category. At Marmaxx, our largest business, home categories were also weak. Same store sales increases benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we opened expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 additional Marshalls stores. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international segments were above the consolidated average. Within the U. S., the strongest regions were the West Coast and the Northeast, while Florida and the Southeast trailed the U.S. average. Overall transaction volume was slightly down in fiscal 2008, more than offset by an increase in the value of the average transaction. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is 23 Table of Contents closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more accurate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.8 75.5 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.7 16.6 16.7 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs (0.2 ) 1.1 — Interest (income) expense, net 0.1 — 0.1 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 7.6 % 6.9 % 7.4 % * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period. Inventory hedges: Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies that are not their local currencies, primarily U.S. dollar purchases. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by SFAS No. 133 (“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”), under generally accepted accounting principles we record a mark-to-market adjustment on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period, prior to the currency gain or loss being recorded on the items being hedged. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the hedges are effectively offset when the related inventory is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates, as there were in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009. Historically, the impact on a full-year basis has not been material. Since the mark-to-market adjustment on these hedges has no impact on net sales, it affects both our operating margins and earnings growth. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.8% in fiscal 2009, 75.5% in fiscal 2008 and 75.8% in fiscal 2007. This ratio for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased 0.3 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales increase. This deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53rd week (estimated at approximately 0.2 percentage points) as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.2 percentage points. Throughout fiscal 2009, we solidly executed our off-price fundamentals, buying close to need, operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points), due to improved markon and lower markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our off-price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise margin improvement was 24 Table of Contents partially offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.7% in fiscal 2009, 16.6% in fiscal 2008 and 16.7% in fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 reflects deleverage from the low same store sales increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat to the prior year. The fiscal 2008 expense ratio was slightly down compared to the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs (0.1 percentage point) being offset by cost containment initiatives. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2009, we cumulatively expensed $171.5 million (pre-tax) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations, settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet. As of January 31, 2009, our reserve balance was $42.2 million, which reflects our current estimation of remaining probable losses (in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as well as legal, monitoring, reporting and other costs. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims and investigations and related expenses and receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes. Interest (income) expense, net: Interest (income) expense, net amounted to expense of $14.3 million for fiscal 2009, income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008 and expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007. The changes from year to year relate primarily to interest income which totaled $22.2 million in fiscal 2009, $40.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $23.6 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 36.9% in fiscal 2009, 37.9% in fiscal 2008 and 37.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflects the favorable impact of a $19 million reduction in the FIN 48 tax liability, which reduced the annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 by 1.3 percentage points. This improvement in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 0.4 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. See Note J to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 one-time benefits as well as an increase due to certain FIN 48 tax positions, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $914.9 million in fiscal 2009, $782.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $787.2 million in fiscal 2007. Income from continuing operations per share was $2.08 in fiscal 2009, $1.68 in fiscal 2008 and $1.65 in fiscal 2007. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but did have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. We estimate the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share by $0.09 per share. 25 Table of Contents The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations by approximately $18 million, after-tax, or $0.04 per share. The charge relating to the Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008, adversely affected income from continuing operations by approximately $119 million, after tax, or $0.25 per share. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Changes in currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 as compared to an increase of $0.01 per share in fiscal 2008. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased fiscal 2008 earnings per share by $0.05 per share in comparison to fiscal 2007. In addition, our share repurchase program affects the comparability of earnings per share. We repurchased 24.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009; we repurchased 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2008; and we repurchased 22.0 million shares at a cost of $557 million in fiscal 2007. Discontinued operations and net income: All historical income statements have been adjusted to reflect the sale of Bob’s Stores in fiscal 2009 and the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007 as discontinued operations. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009, $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for fiscal 2008 and $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share, for fiscal 2007. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and A.J. Wright each is reported as a separate segment. TJX’s stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are reported as the Canadian segment, and TJX’s stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the European segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: Marmaxx: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,362.1 $ 11,966.7 $ 11,531.8 Segment profit $ 1,155.8 $ 1,158.2 $ 1,079.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 9.3 % 9.7 % 9.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 0 % 1 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 874 847 821 Marshalls 806 776 748 Total Marmaxx 1,680 1,623 1,569 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 20,543 20,025 19,390 Marshalls 20,388 19,759 19,078 Total Marmaxx 40,931 39,784 38,468 Net sales at Marmaxx increased 3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Same store sales for Marmaxx were flat in fiscal 2009 compared to a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2009 reflected increased customer traffic offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction. Categories that posted same store sales increases included footwear and accessories, children’s clothing and dresses. During fiscal 2009, we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 220 Marshalls stores, which nearly completes the expansion of footwear departments at Marshalls. Home categories at Marmaxx reported same 26 Table of Contents store sales decreases in fiscal 2009. Geographically in fiscal 2009, same store sales in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions were above the chain average, while same store sales in the West Coast, Florida and the Southeast were below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment margin” or “segment profit margin”) decreased to 9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (0.5 percentage points) due to deleverage on the flat same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin (0.1 percentage point) due to increased markon. As of January 31, 2009, average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at distribution centers, were down 4% compared to a 2% decrease at the prior year end. The decreases in average inventories were primarily due to continued focus on maintaining a liquid inventory position. Segment margin for fiscal 2008 increased to 9.7% compared to 9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins, which increased 0.4 percentage points (as a percentage of net sales) due to lower markdowns and a higher markon, as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures. These improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs and a planned increase in advertising expense. We expect to open approximately 17 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2010, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 1% and increasing its selling square footage by 1%. Canada: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,139.4 $ 2,040.8 $ 1,740.8 Segment profit $ 236.1 $ 235.1 $ 181.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 11.0 % 11.5 % 10.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 5 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 202 191 184 HomeSense 75 71 68 Total 277 262 252 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,647 4,389 4,214 HomeSense 1,437 1,358 1,280 Total 6,084 5,747 5,494 Net sales for the Canadian segment for fiscal 2009 increased by 5% over fiscal 2008. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $68 million. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to a strong increase of 5% in fiscal 2008. Same store sales of outerwear, footwear, jewelry and accessories were above the segment average, while HomeSense same store sales were below the segment average for fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008, while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. However, because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In addition, the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by $1 million, in contrast to a $5 million benefit of the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory related hedges in fiscal 2008 which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for fiscal 2009, reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Winners opened 2 StyleSense stores, a new concept that offers family footwear and accessories. We anticipate that merchandise margins in the Canadian segment will also decline in fiscal 2010 as a result of foreign 27 Table of Contents currency exchange, due to the high volume of merchandise purchases by the Canadian segment denominated in U.S. dollars. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately $24 million for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Most of this increase was due to currency translation, and as a result, it had no impact on segment margin. The increase in segment profit in fiscal 2008 also included the favorable impact of a mark-to-market adjustment of inventory hedge contracts, which increased segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. The fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin, primarily due to increased markon as well as the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios. We expect to add a net of 13 stores in Canada in fiscal 2010, which is an increase of 5% and will increase selling square footage by 5%. Europe: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,242.1 $ 2,216.2 $ 1,864.5 Segment profit $ 137.6 $ 127.2 $ 109.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 6.1 % 5.7 % 5.9 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $282 million. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 compared to a 6% increase last year. Same store sales for footwear and accessories and most other women’s apparel categories performed above the chain average, while home fashions were below the chain average. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8% to $137.6 million, and segment margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to last year. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin reflects improved merchandise margins, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in Germany. We are encouraged by the performance of our German stores but as they are new stores, they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established stores in the U.K. and Ireland. During fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following the opening of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008. T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K. with 7 new stores. Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to 5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rate translation favorably impacted segment profit by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment profit margin. The opening of 5 stores in Germany reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by $11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 0.6 percentage points, offsetting the slightly improved merchandise margin in the remainder of the segment, as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the segment’s cost containment initiatives. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, we plan to open a net of 17 T.K. Maxx stores, including 10 in Germany and 3 HomeSense stores in the U.K. and to expand selling square footage by 8%. HomeGoods: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 1,578.3 $ 1,480.4 $ 1,365.1 Segment profit $ 42.4 $ 76.2 $ 60.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 2.7 % 5.1 % 4.5 % Percent (decrease) increase in same store sales (3 )% 3 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 318 289 270 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,248 5,569 5,181 HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3% in fiscal 2009. Sales of home fashions have been particularly impacted by the weak housing market and recession. Segment margin of 2.7% was down from 5.1% for fiscal 2008. Merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased markdowns. In addition, HomeGoods experienced deleverage on operating costs as a result of the decline in same store sales. We are seeking to address the difficult home environment by operating with very lean inventories and focusing on merchandise categories that we believe will resonate with consumers in these difficult times. HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007, primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. In fiscal 2010, we plan to add a net of 4 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 1%. A.J. Wright: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 677.6 $ 632.7 $ 601.8 Segment profit (loss) $ 2.9 $ (1.8 ) $ (10.3 ) Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales 0.4 % (0.3 )% (1.7 )% Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 135 129 129 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,680 2,576 2,577 A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 7% for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, and segment profit increased to $2.9 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years. We believe A.J. Wright has improved its results through better merchandising and advertising effectiveness, as a result of our improved understanding of A.J. Wright’s customer tastes and spending habits. A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal 2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives. As a result of A.J. Wright’s improved results, we plan to increase the rate of store openings for this chain for fiscal 2010, currently planning to add a net of 13 A.J. Wright stores and increase selling square footage by 10%. 29 Table of Contents General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 General corporate expense $ 140.0 $ 139.4 $ 136.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes is those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat. The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,155 million in fiscal 2009, $1,375 million in fiscal 2008, and $1,213 million in fiscal 2007. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by $220 million as compared to the prior year. Net income, after adjusting for the non-cash impact of depreciation and the sale of Bob’s Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal 2009 (including the benefit of the 53rd week), provided cash of $1,314 million, an increase of $173 million from the adjusted $1,141 million in fiscal 2008. The change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by $132 million, while last year’s deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by $102 million. Deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the non-cash tax benefit of $47 million relating to the establishment of the Computer Intrusion reserve. The favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the Computer Intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it resulted in a use of cash of $210 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a source of cash of $5 million last year. The change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to change in our buying pattern. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of $203 million in fiscal 2008. Last year, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected $117 million for the pre-tax reserve established for the Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted cash flows, while fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by $75 million for payments against and adjustments to the reserve. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by $49 million compared to an increase of $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by $162 million over the prior year. Net income, after adjusting for the non-cash impact of depreciation, for fiscal 2008 increased $50 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, favorably impacted operating cash flows by $5 million compared to a use of cash of $151 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable. These increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision, changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores as well as leases of former TJX businesses. In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $3 million for 2 Bob’s Stores locations, which the buyer of Bob’s 30 Table of Contents Stores has the right to put back to us and which we consider probable. This was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2009 2008 2007 Balance at beginning of year $ 46,076 $ 57,677 $ 14,981 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings (2,908 ) — 61,968 Other lease related obligations 2,908 — 1,555 Interest accretion 1,820 1,820 400 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (7,323 ) (11,214 ) (1,696 ) Fixed asset write-off (non-cash) — — (18,732 ) Termination benefits and all other (9 ) (2,207 ) (799 ) Balance at end of year $ 40,564 $ 46,076 $ 57,677 We added $62 million in fiscal 2007 for the exit costs related to the closing of 34 A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to our consolidated financial statements). The additions to the reserve for other lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 were the result of periodic adjustments to the estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and were offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 related primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all of the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, related primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores. Approximately $25 million of the fiscal 2009 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. Approximately $3 million of the reserve at fiscal 2009 relates to 2 Bob’s Stores locations which are considered probable for being put back to TJX by the buyer. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations. At January 31, 2009, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The actual net cost of these lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and 8 additional Bob’s Stores leases. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is probable. Off-balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. 31 Table of Contents We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $100 million as of January 31, 2009. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing Activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2009 2008 2007 New stores $ 147.6 $ 120.7 $ 123.0 Store renovations and improvements 264.3 269.8 190.2 Office and distribution centers 171.0 136.5 64.8 Capital expenditures $ 582.9 $ 527.0 $ 378.0 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $450 million for fiscal 2010, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. This includes $153 million for new stores, $182 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $115 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer planned store openings and reduced spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores. Investing activities also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million versus net cash payments of $13.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $17.7 million in fiscal 2007. Financing Activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $769 million in fiscal 2009, $953 million in fiscal 2008 and $418 million in fiscal 2007. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $741 million in fiscal 2009, $950 million in fiscal 2008 and $557 million in fiscal 2007 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009, 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008 and 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007. All shares repurchased were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. Our fiscal 2009 repurchases completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in January 2007 and included the repurchase of 8.9 million shares at a cost of $255 million under the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2008. As of January 31, 2009, $745 million remained available for purchase under the current program. The timing of purchases under this program is determined by TJX from time to time based on its assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity and market conditions. We are taking a more conservative approach to our stock repurchase program and currently plan to repurchase up to approximately $250 million of our stock in fiscal 2010. This timing and amount of these purchases are subject to change depending upon the economic environment and other factors. The $464.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes (which are due in February 2021) are convertible into 15.2 million shares of common stock under certain conditions, 32 Table of Contents including if the closing sale price of our common stock reaches specified trigger prices. The trigger price was met during a portion of fiscal 2009 and 52,552 notes were converted during fiscal 2009, resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million shares of common stock. The notes were not convertible during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 because our stock price did not meet the trigger prices during relevant periods. The trigger prices will have to be met during applicable future periods for the notes to be convertible in future quarters. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009, $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008 and $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $177 million in fiscal 2009, $151 million in fiscal 2008 and $123 million in fiscal 2007. Financing activities also included proceeds of $142 million in fiscal 2009, $134 million in fiscal 2008 and $260 million in fiscal 2007 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 3.92% in fiscal 2009. There were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2009 and January 26, 2008, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. Winners did not borrow under the credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2009. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008 and C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007. There were no amounts outstanding on this line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2009, T.K. Maxx had a credit line of £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding was £6.1 million in fiscal 2009 and £16.4 million in fiscal 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long-term debt and other financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 31, 2009, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 806,654 $ 410,125 $ — $ 396,529 $ — Operating lease commitments 5,071,283 913,446 1,582,397 1,137,941 1,437,499 Capital lease obligation 26,671 3,726 7,623 7,824 7,498 Purchase obligations 1,922,537 1,803,500 112,204 4,635 2,198 Total Obligations $ 7,827,145 $ 3,130,797 $ 1,702,224 $ 1,546,929 $ 1,447,195 The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 31, 2009. 33 Table of Contents The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales, which together were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $272.9 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $137.9 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and $240.6 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Impairment of long-lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable. Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return and as a result the 34 Table of Contents unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly. Despite this we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009, primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years. As of the date of this report we have funded $50 million into the qualified pension plan and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2010. Share based compensation: In accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) TJX estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “stock compensation cost” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black Scholes method for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense. Casualty insurance: In July 2007, we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 required us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2009 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2009 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $20.8 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 31, 2009. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposures when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in courts, changes in facts, expiration of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner, which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note M to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigation and the amount of such costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long-term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligations under the leases, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions. 35 Table of Contents Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) operations and on the translation of these foreign operations into the U. S. dollar. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, we hedge a significant portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations, with derivative financial instruments. During fiscal 2009 we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 by approximately $37 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding. As of January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. As a result of the significant decline in the capital markets in 2009 the value of our pension plan assets decreased substantially increasing the unfunded status of our plan and reducing shareholder’s equity on our balance sheet.",2023-12-30 18:51:22.732893
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2012), January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010). OVERVIEW The TJX Companies, Inc. is the largest off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise through our four segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls); and TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). Fiscal 2012 was another record year for us. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2012 include the following: — In fiscal 2012, we posted strong gains in same store sales, net sales and earnings per share on top of significant increases in the last two fiscal years. • Same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2012 over increases of 4% and 6% in the previous two years. The fiscal 2012 increase reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic as we continued to grow our customer base. • Net sales increased to $23.2 billion for fiscal 2012, up 6% over last year’s comparable period. • Earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were $1.93 per diluted share, up 17% compared to $1.65 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the items under “Adjusted Financial Measures” below, were $1.99 in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.75 in fiscal 2011, up 14%. Foreign currency exchange rates benefited fiscal 2012 earnings by $0.01 per share compared to a $0.01 negative impact last year. • Our U.S. businesses continued to exceed our expectations in fiscal 2012, posting strong same store sales increases on top of significant increases in the prior two years and increasing their segment profits. • Both of our international businesses recovered momentum at the end of fiscal 2012. TJX Europe returned to a strong same store sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 after issues with the execution of our off-price fundamentals, as well as growth which we believe was too aggressive and had led to performance issues that had begun in fiscal 2011. TJX Canada also posted a positive same store sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 following execution issues in women’s and, to a lesser extent, children’s categories earlier in the year. — In fiscal 2012, we continued to drive the growth of our chains. • At January 28, 2012, both stores in operation and selling square footage were up 2% over the end of fiscal 2011 including the effect of store closures from our A.J. Wright consolidation. • We increased our long-term potential growth estimates in the U.S. for HomeGoods from 600 to 750 stores and believe we have widened the demographic reach of our customer base. We completed the consolidation of our A.J. Wright business, which has focused our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger businesses with higher returns and enhanced the growth prospects of the overall company. • We introduced the Marshalls chain to Canada, which we believe can ultimately grow to be a 90 to 100 store chain in Canada. We ended fiscal 2012 with six Canadian Marshalls stores and closed our three StyleSense stores to focus our shoe business on the much larger and more profitable shoe categories at Winners and Marshalls. • We slowed growth at TJX Europe in fiscal 2012 to permit the business to focus on improving its operating results and saw improvements by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to believe in the 23 significant growth opportunities for our business in Europe, estimating a total of 750 to 875 stores long-term, with just our current banners in the countries in which we currently operate. — We continued to work to strengthen the execution of our business model of buying opportunistically and close to need, operating with lean inventories and rapid merchandise turns and controlling expenses. • Our fiscal 2012 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 10.4%, a 0.5 percentage point increase from 9.9% in fiscal 2011, while our adjusted pre-tax margin was 10.7%, a 0.1 percentage point increase from an adjusted 10.6% for fiscal 2011. See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below for definition of adjustments. • Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2012 compared to the same period last year improved 0.4 percentage points to 72.7% and improved 0.3 percentage points from 72.9% to 72.6% on an adjusted basis. The improvements over last year were primarily due to buying and occupancy expense leverage. • Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2012 decreased 0.1 percentage points to 16.8% and, on an adjusted basis, increased 0.2 percentage points from 16.3% to 16.5%. • Our consolidated average per store inventories for our existing businesses, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 3% at the end of fiscal 2012. — We continue to use cash to return value to our shareholders. • During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 49.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.4 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. On January 31, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized our 13th stock repurchase program for an additional $2 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we announced our expectation to repurchase approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013. • We paid quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share, aggregating $275 million, for fiscal 2012. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2013 of $0.115 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.46, up 21% over the prior year, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. • Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common stock, reflecting our strong performance and confidence in our future. (All share and related data have been adjusted to reflect the split.) The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 totaled $23.2 billion, a 6% increase over $21.9 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase reflected a 5% increase from new stores, a 4% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates, offset in part by a 4% decrease due to the elimination of sales from stores operating under the A.J. Wright banner. (The fiscal 2012 sales from the converted A.J. Wright stores are included in new stores.) Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled $21.9 billion, an 8% increase over $20.3 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase reflected a 4% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated store count and selling square footage as of January 28, 2012 each increased 2% as compared to the same period last year. These levels of increase, lower than our historical levels, were primarily due to the 72 A.J. Wright stores that were closed and not converted to other banners. We expect to end fiscal 2013 with 3,055 stores, which would represent a 5% increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2012 reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and the number of transactions, which in turn reflected an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales of our home, dresses, men’s, shoes and accessories categories were particularly strong. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strong throughout most regions with Florida and the Southwest performing above the consolidated average and the Midwest trailing the consolidated average. Although for the 24 full fiscal year 2012, the same store sales increase for TJX Europe was well below the consolidated average, and same store sales at TJX Canada decreased from the prior year, both Europe and Canada posted strong same store sales gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by growth in the number of transactions, with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year. Juniors, jewelry and home performed particularly well in fiscal 2011. Geographically, in the U.S., same store sales were strong throughout the country with the West Coast and Southwest above the consolidated average and the Northeast below the consolidated average. The same store sales increase in Canada was in line with the consolidated average, while same store sales decreased in Europe. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis: Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2012 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2011 Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2010*** As reported As adjusted* As reported As adjusted* As reported As adjusted* Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % n/a Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 72.7 72.6 73.1 72.9 73.8 n/a Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.5 16.9 16.3 16.4 n/a Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related expenses — — (0.1 ) — — n/a Interest expense, net 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 n/a Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes** 10.4 % 10.7 % 9.9 % 10.6 % 9.6 % n/a Diluted earnings per share-continuing operations $ 1.93 $ 1.99 $ 1.65 $ 1.75 $ 1.42 n/a * See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below. ** Figures may not foot due to rounding. *** There were no adjustments for fiscal 2010. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. 25 — Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by GAAP, we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 72.7% in fiscal 2012, 73.1% in fiscal 2011 and 73.8% in fiscal 2010. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2012 was due to expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs (particularly at Marmaxx and HomeGoods) partially offset by lower merchandise margins at TJX Europe and TJX Canada. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2011 reflected improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 0.5 percentage points over the prior year, along with expense leverage on the 4% same store sales increase, partially offset by a 0.2 percentage point negative impact from the A.J. Wright segment loss in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter arising from the A.J. Wright consolidation. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2012, 16.9% in fiscal 2011 and 16.4% in fiscal 2010. The A.J. Wright consolidation had a significant impact on this ratio in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, increasing the ratio by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and decreased 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2011. The increase in the adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was due to increased general corporate expenses, primarily investment in new systems, talent and e-commerce, costs associated with a voluntary retirement program and fourth quarter charges and write-offs at TJX Canada and TJX Europe (see segment discussions below), offset in part by expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly at HomeGoods. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 as a percentage of net sales, on an adjusted basis, compared to fiscal 2010 reflected the benefit of cost reduction programs, a reduction in incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net was an expense of $35.6 million for fiscal 2012, $39.1 million for fiscal 2011 and $39.5 million for fiscal 2010. The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2012 2011 2010 Interest expense $ 49,276 $ 49,014 $ 49,278 Capitalized interest (2,593 ) — (758 ) Interest (income) (11,035 ) (9,877 ) (9,011 ) Interest expense, net $ 35,648 $ 39,137 $ 39,509 Gross interest expense for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was essentially flat to the respective prior periods. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.0% in fiscal 2012, 38.1% in fiscal 2011 and 37.8% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to a reduction in tax reserves related to the resolution of U.S. Federal tax audits, partially offset by an increase in state and federal tax reserves, for a net decrease in the provision. 26 The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and an increase in our state tax reserves, partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between Canada and the United States (related to our intercompany transfer pricing) and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes. We anticipate our effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2013 will increase to 38.5% primarily due to the expiration of the U.S. Work Opportunity Tax Credit legislation and the absence of the fiscal 2012 net benefit due to a reduction in our tax reserves. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2012, a 12% increase over $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, which in turn was a 10% increase over $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were $1.99, which exclude the negative impact of $0.04 of costs related to closing the A.J. Wright stores not closed in fiscal 2011 and $0.02 of costs to convert and re-open A.J. Wright stores under other banners. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.65. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were $1.75, which exclude the negative effect of the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for A.J. Wright arising from closing A.J. Wright, which reduced earnings per share by $0.11, offset in part by a $0.01 per share benefit for a reduction in the provision for the Computer Intrusion related costs. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. When comparing fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011, foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2012 earnings per share by $0.01 per share compared with a $0.01 per share negative impact in fiscal 2011. When comparing fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010, foreign currency exchange rates benefited fiscal 2011 earnings per share by $0.02 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share. Our stock repurchases benefit our earnings per share. We repurchased 49.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012, 55.1 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011, and 54.0 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010. Discontinued operations and net income: In fiscal 2011, we had a net gain from discontinued operations reflecting an after-tax benefit of $3.6 million (which did not impact diluted earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre-tax reduction of the estimated cost of settling lease-related obligations of former businesses. Net income, which includes the impact of these discontinued operations, was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per share, for fiscal 2012, $1.3 billion, or $1.65 per share, for fiscal 2011, and $1.2 billion, or $1.42 per share, for fiscal 2010. Adjusted Financial Measures: In addition to presenting financial results in conformity with GAAP, we are also presenting them on an “adjusted” basis. We adjusted them to exclude: — from the fiscal 2012 results, the costs related to the A.J. Wright consolidation, including closing costs and additional operating losses related to the A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2012 and the costs incurred by the Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments to convert former A.J. Wright stores to their banners and hold grand re-opening events for these stores, and — from the fiscal 2011 results, the operating loss of the A.J. Wright segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which included a majority of the costs related to closing the A.J. Wright business, and the benefit of a reduction to the provision for the Computer Intrusion which occurred over four years ago. These adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability. We use these adjusted measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and our Board of Directors use them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 27 Reconciliations of each of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with GAAP are provided below.

Maxx and Marshalls stores) and HomeGoods. Our TJX Canada segment operates our stores in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls), and our TJX Europe segment operates our stores in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). A. J. Wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 15,367.5 $ 14,092.2 $ 13,270.9 Segment profit $ 2,073.4 $ 1,876.0 $ 1,588.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.5 % 13.3 % 12.0 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* 13.6 % n/a n/a Percent increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Maxx 22,894 21,611 20,890 Marshalls 22,042 20,912 20,513 Total Marmaxx 44,936 42,523 41,403 * See reconciliation under “Adjusted Financial Measures.” Net sales at Marmaxx increased 9% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 5%, on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase in the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic. Customer transactions grew in fiscal 2012 on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2011. The categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 were dresses, men’s, shoes and accessories. Geographically, there were strong same store sales increases throughout the country, with Florida and the Southwest the strongest and the Midwest below the chain average. Segment margin was up 0.2 percentage points to 13.5% for fiscal 2012 compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2011, primarily due to expense leverage (particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points) on strong same store sales growth. This improvement was offset in part by slightly lower merchandise margins and the store conversion and grand re-opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to T.J. Maxx or Marshalls. Adjusted segment profit margin, which excludes the A.J. Wright conversion costs, increased 0.3 percentage points to 13.6% for fiscal 2012. Segment margin increased to 13.3% in fiscal 2011 from 12.0% in fiscal 2010. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins of 0.8 percentage points, largely as a result of lower markdowns. In addition, the 4% increase in same store sales for this period provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.2 percentage points. In fiscal 2013, we expect to open approximately 85 new Marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by 4%. 29 HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,244.0 $ 1,958.0 $ 1,794.4 Segment profit $ 234.4 $ 186.5 $ 137.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 10.4 % 9.5 % 7.7 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* 10.6 % n/a n/a Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period 374 336 323 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 7,391 6,619 6,354 * See reconciliation under “Adjusted Financial Measures.” HomeGoods’ net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2012, on top of a strong same store sales increase of 6% in fiscal 2011 resulting from a strong increase in customer traffic along with an increase in the value of the average transaction. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 was 10.4% up from 9.5% for fiscal 2011. The increase was due to expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase and an increase in merchandise margins (primarily due to lower markdowns), partially offset by the conversion and grand re-opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to HomeGoods. Adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 excluding the A.J. Wright conversion costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 10.6%. HomeGoods’ net sales increased 9% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011, driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic, compared to a same store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2010. Segment margin of 9.5% was up from 7.7% for fiscal 2010, due to increased merchandise margins, driven by decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 6% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by efforts to manage this business with much lower inventory levels than in previous years and by increasing our inventory turns. In fiscal 2013, we plan a net increase of approximately 40 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by 11%. A.J. Wright We completed the consolidation of the A.J. Wright division in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, closing the remaining stores not being converted to other banners. These closing costs (primarily lease-related obligations) and A.J. Wright operating losses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were reported as an A.J. Wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Due to the anticipated migration of customers to other chains, A.J. Wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 9.2 $ 888.4 $ 779.8 Segment profit (loss) $ (49.3 ) $ (130.0 ) $ 12.6 Percent increase in same store sales — 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period — 142 150 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) — 2,874 3,012 30 A majority of the costs related to the closing of the A.J. Wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The operating results of the A.J. Wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of $140.6 million, which includes the following: Dollars in thousands Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter Fixed asset impairment charges—Non cash $ 82,589 Severance and termination benefits 25,400 Lease obligations and other closing costs 11,700 Operating losses 20,912 Total segment loss $ 140,601 International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,680.1 $ 2,510.2 $ 2,167.9 Segment profit $ 348.0 $ 352.0 $ 255.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.0 % 14.0 % 11.8 % Percent (decrease) increase in same store sales (1 )% 4 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 216 215 211 HomeSense 86 82 79 Marshalls 6 — — Total 308 297 290 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,008 4,966 4,847 HomeSense 1,670 1,594 1,527 Marshalls 162 — — Total 6,840 6,560 6,374 Net sales for TJX Canada increased 7% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points, as compared to the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 1% in fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 4% in fiscal 2011 largely due to execution issues in women’s and, to a lesser extent, children’s categories. Our efforts to address these issues showed improved results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 with same store sales growth of 3%. Segment profit for fiscal 2012 decreased to $348.0 million, due to weak sales volume in the first three quarters (mitigated in part by strong inventory and expense management) and, to a lesser extent, a fourth quarter charge of $6 million for the closure of our StyleSense stores. These decreases in segment profit more than offset a $10 million benefit from foreign currency translation and a $4 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to expense deleverage and lower merchandise margins, which more than offset the favorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment of our inventory-related hedges. Net sales for TJX Canada increased 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Same store sales were up 4% in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2010. Same store sales of men’s apparel, dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011. Segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to $352 million, compared to $255 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by $25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by $7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. Segment margin increased 2.2 percentage points to 14.0% in 31 fiscal 2011, compared to 11.8% in fiscal 2010. The segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins, offset by the unfavorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment of our inventory hedges, which reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. We opened our first six Marshalls stores in Canada in fiscal 2012. We expect to add a net of 15 stores in Canada in fiscal 2013 and plan to increase selling square footage by 5%. TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,890.7 $ 2,493.5 $ 2,275.4 Segment profit $ 68.7 $ 75.8 $ 164.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 2.4 % 3.0 % 7.2 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 2 % (3 )% 5 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Maxx 7,588 7,052 6,106 HomeSense 402 402 222 Total 7,990 7,454 6,328 Net sales for TJX Europe increased 16% in fiscal 2012 to $2.9 billion compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011. Currency translation benefited fiscal 2012 sales growth by 4 percentage points. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2011. TJX Europe ended fiscal 2012 by posting a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 10%. We believe the improvement at the end of fiscal 2012 reflected the benefits of our strategy of slowing growth in Europe and re-focusing on execution of our off-price fundamentals. Segment profit decreased to $68.7 million for fiscal 2012, and segment profit margin decreased to 2.4%. For fiscal 2012, the impact of foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges was immaterial. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect aggressive markdowns, primarily taken in the first quarter to clear inventory and adjust our merchandise mix. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 TJX Europe incurred charges for the closing of an office facility and the write-off of certain technology systems and other adjustments, which contributed to the decrease in segment profit and segment margin. Despite these fourth quarter charges, segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 nearly doubled reflecting the effects of the changes we made to address the execution issues that adversely affected fiscal 2011 and earlier parts of fiscal 2012. Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2011 to $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2010. Currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results, reducing net sales by $86 million. Same store sales were down 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5% increase in fiscal 2010. Segment profit decreased to $75.8 million for fiscal 2011, and segment profit margin decreased to 3.0%. Issues with the execution of our off-price fundamentals as well as growth, which we believe was too aggressive, led to TJX Europe’s below-plan sales and segment profit in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2013, we plan to keep our growth rate modest with a net of 10 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe, expanding selling square footage by 2%. Longer term, we continue to believe that TJX Europe holds significant growth potential for our Company. 32 General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 General corporate expense $ 228.3 $ 168.7 $ 166.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our investments in systems and technology, talent and associate training expenses, costs related to our e-commerce initiative and costs related to a fourth quarter voluntary retirement program and an executive separation agreement. Collectively, these items accounted for approximately $40 million of the increase in general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,916 million in fiscal 2012, $1,976 million in fiscal 2011 and $2,272 million in fiscal 2010. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 decreased $60 million compared to fiscal 2011. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,995 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1,897 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $98 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $224 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $48 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in inventory was in our distribution centers, primarily due to higher pack-away inventory as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities. The average inventory in our stores at the end of fiscal 2012 was below fiscal 2011 levels. The additional cash outlay for the net change in inventory and accounts payable is due to the timing of payments. The impact of the changes in all other assets and liabilities, which reduced operating cash flows by $77 million year-over-year, was more than offset by the favorable impact on cash flows of $94 million due to a higher deferred income tax provision. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased $295 million compared to fiscal 2010. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,659 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $238 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $48 million in fiscal 2011, compared to a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010. Although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011, our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010. In addition, the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth, as well as a year-end increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows, as compared to fiscal 2010, by $203 million due to the timing of tax payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of $31 million in fiscal 2010. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores and A.J. Wright. The majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations. The reserve balance was $45.4 million at January 28, 2012 and $54.7 million at January 29, 2011. The cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2012 2011 2010 New stores $ 211.6 $ 196.3 $ 127.8 Store renovations and improvements 319.8 301.0 206.8 Office and distribution centers 271.9 209.8 94.7 Capital expenditures $ 803.3 $ 707.1 $ 429.3 33 We expect that we will spend approximately $875 million to $900 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2013, including approximately $415 million for our offices and distribution centers (including information systems) to support growth, $305 million for store renovations and $180 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. We also purchased short-term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2012, we purchased $152 million of such short-term investments, compared to $120 million in fiscal 2011. Additionally, $133 million of such short-term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2012 compared to $180 million last year. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,336 million in fiscal 2012, $1,224 million in fiscal 2011 and $584 million in fiscal 2010. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,370 million to repurchase 49.7 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2012, $1,201 million to repurchase 55.1 million shares in fiscal 2011 and $950 million to repurchase 54.0 million shares in fiscal 2010, all of which were retired. We record the purchase of our stock on a settlement basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. All share information disclosed is on a post-split basis. As of January 28, 2012, $225 million was available for purchase under the stock repurchase program approved in February 2011. On January 31, 2012, our Board of Directors approved an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2013. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. In April 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes. In connection with this issuance, we called for the redemption of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 30.2 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. In July 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility in August 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity date in December 2009. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.38 per share in fiscal 2012, $0.30 per share in fiscal 2011 and $0.24 per share in fiscal 2010. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $275 million in fiscal 2012, $229 million in fiscal 2011 and $198 million in fiscal 2010. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.115 per share, effective with the dividend to be declared in April 2012 and payable in May 2012, subject to the approval and declaration of our Board of Directors. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $219 million in fiscal 2012, $176 million in fiscal 2011 and $170 million in fiscal 2010. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper. We also have $1 billion in revolving credit facilities, which are described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our revolving credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. 34 Contractual obligations: As of January 28, 2012, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations requiring cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,037,669 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 468,925 $ 440,156 Operating lease commitments 6,985,102 1,124,042 1,999,174 1,500,107 2,361,779 Capital lease obligation 15,322 3,912 7,824 3,586 — Purchase obligations 2,486,221 2,466,278 19,690 210 43 Total Obligations $ 10,524,314 $ 3,637,095 $ 2,112,413 $ 1,972,828 $ 2,801,978 The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The operating lease commitments above are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2012. Purchase obligations include obligations under purchase orders for merchandise, capital items, supplies and other operating items, contracts for maintenance needs and other services, and executive employment and other agreements. Our purchase obligations do not include agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities which include $302.2 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $163.6 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $249.6 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long-lived assets: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of 35 individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 28, 2012 that the carrying value of our long-lived assets was appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. When the market performance of our plan assets, discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2012 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $75 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in a reduction to or additional accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for former operations: As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist 36 to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business, some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between our domestic and international operations. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and intercompany transactions with our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 28, 2012, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for fiscal 2012 by approximately $42 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically use 37 financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of January 28, 2012. There were no variable rate borrowings outstanding as of January 28, 2012. The analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:17.810162
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2013,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion that follows relates to our 53-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013) and our 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2012) and January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011). OVERVIEW The TJX Companies, Inc. is the largest off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. Our over 3,000 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand-name and designer apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices, every day. We operate our business in four divisions: Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods, both in the United States; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx and HomeSense in Europe). Fiscal 2013 was another record year for us. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2013 include the following: — In fiscal 2013, we posted strong gains in same store sales, net sales and earnings per share on top of significant increases in the last two fiscal years. • Net sales increased to $25.9 billion for fiscal 2013, up 12% over fiscal 2012. The 53rd week in fiscal 2013 increased net sales by 2%. • Same store sales, on a 52-week basis, increased 7% in fiscal 2013 over increases of 4% in each of the previous two years. The fiscal 2013 increase was driven by an increase in customer traffic as we continued to grow our customer base. • Earnings per share for fiscal 2013 were $2.55 per diluted share, up 32% compared to $1.93 per diluted share in fiscal 2012, or up 28% compared to fiscal 2012 adjusted* diluted earnings per share of $1.99. The 53rd week added approximately $0.08 per share to fiscal 2013 earnings. • All of our divisions exceeded our expectations in fiscal 2013, posting strong same store sales increases and increases in segment profits. * Adjusted measures exclude certain items affecting comparability. See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below. — In fiscal 2013, we continued to drive the growth of our divisions. • At February 2, 2013, the number of stores in operation was up 5% and selling square footage was up 4% over the end of fiscal 2012. We expect to end fiscal 2014 with 3,200 stores, which would represent a 5% increase in our consolidated store base and a 4% increase in our selling square footage. • All of our divisions posted strong same store sales increases, driven by increases in customer traffic. New T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores performed well as we expanded into more rural markets as well as major cities. The Marshalls chain in Canada also has performed well and TJX Europe regained its momentum with a very strong 10% same store sales increase. • We invested in e-commerce. In December, 2012, we purchased Sierra Trading Post, an off-price internet retailer. We expect to launch our T.J. Maxx website in a small, controlled mode in the second half of fiscal 2014. — We continued our focus on operating with lean inventories, driving rapid merchandise turns and controlling expenses. • Our fiscal 2013 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 11.9%, a 1.5 percentage point increase compared to fiscal 2012, and a 1.2 percentage point increase from an adjusted 10.7% for fiscal 2012. The 53rd week benefited the fiscal 2013 pre-tax margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. 23 • Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2013 improved 1.1 percentage points to 71.6% compared to fiscal 2012 and improved 1.0 percentage points compared to an adjusted basis for fiscal 2012. The improvements over last year were primarily due to improved merchandise margins and buying and occupancy expense leverage. • Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2013 decreased 0.4 percentage points from 16.8% in fiscal 2012 to 16.4%. On an adjusted basis, this ratio decreased 0.1 percentage points from an adjusted16.5% in fiscal 2012. • Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, but excluding our internet based business Sierra Trading Post, were down 6% at the end of fiscal 2013. — We continued to use cash to return value to our shareholders. • During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 30.6 million shares of our common stock for $1.3 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized our 14th stock repurchase program for an additional $1.5 billion. We expect to repurchase approximately $1.3 to $1.4 billion of our stock in fiscal 2014. • We paid quarterly dividends of $0.115 per share for fiscal 2013. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2014 of $0.145 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.58 per share, which would represent a 26% increase over the prior year, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013 totaled $25.9 billion, a 12% increase over $23.2 billion in fiscal 2012. The increase reflected a 7% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 2% increase from the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2013 net sales. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 totaled $23.2 billion, a 6% increase over $21.9 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase reflected a 5% increase from new stores, a 4% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates, offset in part by a 4% decrease due to the elimination of sales from stores operating under the A.J. Wright banner. (The fiscal 2012 sales from the converted A.J. Wright stores are included in new store sales.) Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2013 were driven by an increase in customer traffic, and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction. Sales of both apparel and home fashions were equally strong. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strong throughout most regions with Florida and the Southwest performing above the consolidated average and virtually all other regions close to the consolidated average. Our foreign segments both posted same store sales increases, with TJX Europe above the consolidated average and TJX Canada below the consolidated average. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2012 reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales of our home, dresses, men’s, shoes and accessories categories were particularly strong. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strong throughout most regions, with Florida and the Southwest performing above the consolidated average and the Midwest trailing the consolidated average. For the full fiscal year 2012, the same store sales increase for TJX Europe was well below the consolidated average, and same store sales at TJX Canada decreased from the prior year, but both Europe and Canada posted strong same store sales gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a 24 constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis: Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2013 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2012 Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2011 As reported As reported As adjusted* As reported As adjusted* Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.6 72.7 72.6 73.1 72.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.4 16.8 16.5 16.9 16.3 Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related expenses — — — (0.1 ) — Interest expense, net 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes** 11.9 % 10.4 % 10.7 % 9.9 % 10.6 % Diluted earnings per share-continuing operations $ 2.55 $ 1.93 $ 1.99 $ 1.65 $ 1.75 * See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below. ** Figures may not foot due to rounding. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. — Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.6% in fiscal 2013, 72.7% in fiscal 2012 and 73.1% in fiscal 2011. The 1.1 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to improved merchandise margins, driven by lower markdowns, as well as expense leverage on the strong same store sales increase. In addition, the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 benefitted this expense ratio by approximately 0.2 percentage points. 25 The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2012 was due to expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs (particularly at Marmaxx and HomeGoods), partially offset by a decrease in merchandise margins at TJX Europe and TJX Canada. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.4% in fiscal 2013, 16.8% in fiscal 2012 and 16.9% in fiscal 2011. On an adjusted basis, this ratio was 16.5% in fiscal 2012 and 16.3% in fiscal 2011. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to expense leverage on strong same store sales, partially offset by contributions to the TJX Foundation and by expenses related to two third quarter items: a non-cash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual for prior years and a non-operating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores. The increase in the adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by increased general corporate expenses, primarily investment in new systems, talent and e-commerce, costs associated with a voluntary retirement program and fourth quarter charges and write-offs at TJX Canada and TJX Europe (see segment discussions below), offset in part by expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly at HomeGoods. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 Interest expense $ 48,582 $ 49,276 $ 49,014 Capitalized interest (7,750 ) (2,593 ) — Interest (income) (11,657 ) (11,035 ) (9,877 ) Interest expense, net $ 29,175 $ 35,648 $ 39,137 Gross interest expense has remained fairly constant over the last three fiscal years. The reduction in our net interest expense position in both fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2012 was due to capitalized interest on major capital projects that have not yet been placed in service. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.0% in fiscal 2013, 38.0% in fiscal 2012 and 38.1% in fiscal 2011. TJX’s effective rate remained constant for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from an increase in foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, but this benefit was offset by the absence of the benefit in fiscal 2012 due to a net reduction in federal and state tax reserves. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to a reduction in the fiscal 2012 tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of U.S. Federal tax audits, partially offset by an increase in state and U.S. Federal tax reserves, for a net decrease in the provision. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013, a 27% increase over $1.5 billion in fiscal 2012, which in turn was a 12% increase over $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share were $2.55 in fiscal 2013, $1.93 in fiscal 2012 and $1.65 in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share included an approximate $0.08 per share benefit due to the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.99 for fiscal 2012 and $1.75 for fiscal 2011 (see Adjusted Financial Measures). Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 but benefitted fiscal 2012 earnings per share by $0.01 per share compared with a $0.01 per share negative impact in fiscal 2011. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share. Our stock repurchases benefit our earnings per share. We repurchased 30.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013, 49.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012, and 55.1 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011. 26 Discontinued operations and net income: In fiscal 2011, we had a net gain from discontinued operations reflecting an after-tax benefit of $3.6 million (which did not impact diluted earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre-tax reduction of the estimated cost of settling lease-related obligations of former businesses. Net income, which includes the impact of these discontinued operations, was $1.9 billion, or $2.55 per share, for fiscal 2013, $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per share, for fiscal 2012, and $1.3 billion, or $1.65 per share, for fiscal 2011. Adjusted Financial Measures: In addition to presenting financial results in conformity with GAAP, we are also presenting certain measures on an “adjusted” basis. We adjusted them to exclude: • from the fiscal 2012 results, costs related to the A.J. Wright consolidation incurred in fiscal 2012, including closing costs, additional operating losses related to the A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2012 and the costs incurred by the Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments to convert former A.J. Wright stores to their banners and hold grand re-opening events for these stores, and • from the fiscal 2011 results, costs related to the A.J. Wright consolidation incurred in fiscal 2011 (which included a majority of the costs related to closing the A.J. Wright business and the operating loss of the A.J. Wright segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011), and the benefit of a reduction to the provision for the Computer Intrusion which occurred over four years ago. These adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability. We use these adjusted measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and our Board of Directors uses them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of each of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with GAAP for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are provided below.

Our TJX Canada segment operates our stores in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls), and our TJX Europe segment operates our stores in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). (A.J. Wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation.) Late in fiscal 2013 we acquired Sierra Trading Post (STP), an off-price internet retailer. The results of STP are not material and have been included with our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. 28 Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 Net sales $ 17,011.4 $ 15,367.5 $ 14,092.2 Segment profit $ 2,486.3 $ 2,073.4 $ 1,876.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.6 % 13.5 % 13.3 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* n/a 13.6 % n/a Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 5 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

At February 2, 2013, STP operated 4 stores with a selling square footage of 83,000. Net sales at Marmaxx increased 11% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 6% in fiscal 2013, on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic, with both apparel and home fashions posting solid same store sales gains. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout the country. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase in the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic. The categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 were dresses, men’s, shoes and accessories. Geographically, same store sales increases were strong throughout the country, with Florida and the Southwest the strongest and the Midwest below the chain average. Segment margin was up 1.1 percentage points to 14.6% for fiscal 2013 compared to 13.5% for fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to a 0.6 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, largely due to lower markdowns. The fiscal 2013 segment margin also benefitted from expense leverage (particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.4 percentage points) on strong same store sales growth and the 53rd week which lifted the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Segment margin was up 0.2 percentage points to 13.5% for fiscal 2012 compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2011, primarily due to expense leverage (particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points) on strong same store sales growth. This improvement was offset in part by slightly lower merchandise margins and the store conversion and grand re-opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to T.J. Maxx or Marshalls. Adjusted segment profit margin, which excludes the A.J. Wright conversion costs, increased 0.3 percentage points to 13.6% for fiscal 2012. We believe our ongoing store remodel program has benefited our sales in this segment. As a result of the remodel program and our new store openings, approximately 75% of T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s stores were in the new prototype at the end of fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we expect to open approximately 75 new Marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by approximately 3%. 29 HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 Net sales $ 2,657.1 $ 2,244.0 $ 1,958.0 Segment profit $ 324.6 $ 234.4 $ 186.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 12.2 % 10.4 % 9.5 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* n/a 10.6 % n/a Percent increase in same store sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 415 374 336 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 8,210 7,391 6,619 * See “Adjusted Financial Measures” above. HomeGoods’ net sales increased 18% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, on top of a 15% increase in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 7% in fiscal 2013, on top of a same store sales increase of 6% in fiscal 2012. Same store sales growth was driven by an increase in customer traffic and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of the average transaction in both years. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2013 was 12.2%, up from 10.4% for fiscal 2012. The increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, particularly occupancy and administrative costs, and an increase in merchandise margins. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 was 10.4% up from 9.5% for fiscal 2011. The increase was due to expense leverage on the same store sales increase and an increase in merchandise margins (primarily due to lower markdowns), partially offset by the conversion and grand re-opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to HomeGoods. Adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 (which excludes the A.J. Wright conversion costs) increased 1.1 percentage points to 10.6%. In fiscal 2014, we plan a net increase of approximately 30 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7%. A.J. Wright We completed the consolidation of the A.J. Wright division in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, closing the remaining stores not being converted to other banners. These closing costs (primarily lease-related obligations) and A.J. Wright operating losses totaled $49.3 million and were reported as an A.J. Wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011 A.J. Wright had a segment loss of $130.0 million on net sales of $888.4 million. A majority of the costs related to the closing of A.J. Wright were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 segment loss includes a fourth quarter loss of $140.6 million. Due to the anticipated migration of A.J. Wright customers to our other U.S. segments, A.J. Wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. 30 International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 Net sales $ 2,926.0 $ 2,680.1 $ 2,510.2 Segment profit $ 414.9 $ 348.0 $ 352.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.2 % 13.0 % 14.0 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 5 % (1 )% 4 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 222 216 215 HomeSense 88 86 82 Marshalls 14 6 — Total 324 308 297 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,115 5,008 4,966 HomeSense 1,698 1,670 1,594 Marshalls 363 162 — Total 7,176 6,840 6,560 Net sales for TJX Canada increased 9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2013, as compared to the same period last year. Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2013 compared to a decrease of 1% in fiscal 2012. Segment profit for fiscal 2013 increased to $414.9 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.2 percentage points to 14.2%. The improvement in segment margin was driven by increased merchandise margin, largely due to lower markdowns. This increase in segment margin was partially offset by increased incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2013 segment profit and segment margin. Net sales for TJX Canada increased 7% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2011. Same store sales decreased 1% in fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 4% in fiscal 2011 largely due to execution issues in women’s and, to a lesser extent, children’s categories. Segment profit for fiscal 2012 decreased to $348.0 million, due to weak sales volume in the first three quarters (mitigated in part by strong inventory and expense management) and, to a lesser extent, a fourth quarter charge of $6 million for the closure of our StyleSense stores. These decreases in segment profit more than offset a $10 million benefit from foreign currency translation and a $4 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to expense deleverage and lower merchandise margins, which more than offset the favorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment of our inventory-related hedges. 31 We expect to add a net of approximately 20 stores in Canada in fiscal 2014 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 6%. TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 Net sales $ 3,283.9 $ 2,890.7 $ 2,493.5 Segment profit $ 215.7 $ 68.7 $ 75.8 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 6.6 % 2.4 % 3.0 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 10 % 2 % (3 )% Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency translation negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales growth by 2 percentage points. Fiscal 2013 same store sales increased 10% compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2012. Segment profit more than tripled to $215.7 million for fiscal 2013, and segment profit margin increased to 6.6%. The improvements we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in this segment’s performance as we slowed growth and re-focused on off-price fundamentals continued throughout fiscal 2013. More than half of the improvement in segment margin came from improved merchandise margins, which was virtually all due to lower markdowns. Segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012, benefitted from the absence of the fiscal 2012 charges for closing an office facility and the write-off of certain technology systems and other adjustments. The impact of foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges was immaterial for fiscal 2013. Net sales for TJX Europe increased 16% in fiscal 2012 to $2.9 billion compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011. Currency translation benefited fiscal 2012 sales growth by 4 percentage points. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2011. TJX Europe ended fiscal 2012 by posting a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 10%. Segment profit decreased to $68.7 million for fiscal 2012, and segment profit margin decreased to 2.4%. For fiscal 2012, the impact of foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges was immaterial. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect aggressive markdowns, primarily taken in the first quarter to clear inventory and adjust our merchandise mix and the charges and write-offs referenced above. Despite these fourth quarter charges, segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 nearly doubled reflecting the effects of the changes we made to address the execution issues that adversely affected fiscal 2011 and earlier parts of fiscal 2012. 32 We expect to add approximately 25 net stores in Europe in fiscal 2014 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 6%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 General corporate expense $ 335.0 $ 228.3 $ 168.7 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes contributions to the TJX Foundation, an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of Sierra Trading Post. These items account for $56 million of the increase in general corporate expense. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes increased incentive compensation accruals under our performance-based plans, additional investments in systems and technology and additional costs related to the expansion of our home office facilities. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our investments in systems and technology, talent and associate training expenses, costs related to our e-commerce initiative and costs related to a fourth quarter voluntary retirement program and an executive separation agreement. Collectively, these items accounted for approximately $40 million of the increase in general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,046 million in fiscal 2013, $1,916 million in fiscal 2012 and $1,976 million in fiscal 2011. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 increased $1,130 million compared to fiscal 2012. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $2,427 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $1,995 million in fiscal 2012, an increase of $432 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a source of cash of $239 million in fiscal 2013, compared to a use of cash of $224 million in fiscal 2012. This change was attributable to faster inventory turns and a reduction in consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the distribution centers, which was down 6% at the end of fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 (excluding Sierra Trading Post). The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash by $269 million in fiscal 2013 versus $14 million in fiscal 2012, which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued incentive compensation and accrued pension. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $48 million year-over-year due to the change in deferred income tax provision and income taxes payable which was largely offset by a reduction in operating cash flows of $47 million due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to the timing of rental payments. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 decreased $60 million compared to fiscal 2011. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,995 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1,897 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of $98 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $224 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $48 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in inventory was in our distribution centers, primarily due to higher pack-away inventory as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities. The average inventory in our stores at the end of fiscal 2012 was below fiscal 2011 levels. The additional cash outlay for the net change in inventory and accounts payable is due to the timing of payments. The impact of the changes in all other assets and liabilities, which reduced operating cash flows by $77 million year-over-year, was more than offset by the favorable impact on cash flows of $94 million due to a higher deferred income tax provision. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores and A.J. Wright. The majority of these obligations relate to 33 real estate leases associated with these operations. The reserve balance was $45.2 million at February 2, 2013 and $45.4 million at January 28, 2012. The cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions February 2,2013 January 28,2012 January 29,2011 New stores $ 170.7 $ 211.6 $ 196.3 Store renovations and improvements 282.7 319.8 301.0 Office and distribution centers 524.8 271.9 209.8 Capital expenditures $ 978.2 $ 803.3 $ 707.1 We expect that we will spend approximately $925 million to $950 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2014, including approximately $444 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, $316 million for store renovations and $190 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. We also purchased short-term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2013, we purchased $356 million of such short-term investments, compared to $152 million in fiscal 2012. Additionally, $213 million of such short-term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2013 compared to $133 million last year. Investing activities for fiscal 2013 also included the net cash paid in December 2012 for the acquisition of STP, an off-price internet retailer. The purchase price, net of cash acquired was $190 million which is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,476 million in fiscal 2013; $1,336 million in fiscal 2012 and $1,224 million in fiscal 2011. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,300 million to repurchase 30.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013, $1,370 million to repurchase 49.7 million shares in fiscal 2012 and $1,201 million to repurchase 55.1 million shares in fiscal 2011. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2014. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.46 per share in fiscal 2013, $0.38 per share in fiscal 2012 and $0.30 per share in fiscal 2011. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $324 million in fiscal 2013, $275 million in fiscal 2012 and $229 million in fiscal 2011. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $134 million in fiscal 2013, $219 million in fiscal 2012 and $176 million in fiscal 2011. We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note J to the consolidated financial statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. 34 Contractual obligations: As of February 2, 2013, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 1,007,838 $ 42,863 $ 485,725 $ 52,125 $ 427,125 Operating lease commitments(2) 6,719,214 1,185,379 2,080,098 1,487,253 1,966,484 Purchase obligations(3) 2,956,330 2,823,533 119,250 13,495 52 Total Obligations $ 10,683,382 $ 4,051,775 $ 2,685,073 $ 1,552,873 $ 2,393,661 (1) Includes estimated interest costs. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2013. Does not include leases reflected in our reserve for former operations. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $395.3 million for employee compensation and benefits and $257.2 million for uncertain tax positions. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. Impairment of long-lived assets: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. 35 We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in tax or other benefits laws and regulations, or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2013 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $75 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for former operations: As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our 36 management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business, some potential market risks are discussed below: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between our domestic and international operations. As more fully described in Note E to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and intercompany transactions with our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of February 2, 2013, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for fiscal 2013 by approximately $65 million. Equity Price Risk The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:14.892088
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2014,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year ended February 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014), our 53-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013) and our 52-week fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2012). OVERVIEW We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,200 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe). Late in fiscal 2013 TJX acquired Sierra Trading Post (STP), a leading off-price Internet retailer, which operates four stores and sierratradingpost.com in the U.S. The results of STP have been reported with the Marmaxx segment. Fiscal 2014 was another successful year for TJX as we posted solid gains in same store sales, net sales and earnings per share on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. We increased our e-commerce presence by launching our new e-commerce website tjmaxx.com during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and successfully transitioned STP into the TJX family. We continued our focus on operating with lean inventory levels and reinvesting in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth. We also continued using cash to return value to our shareholders. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2014 include the following: — Same store sales, on a 52-week basis, increased 3% in fiscal 2014 over an increase of 7% in fiscal 2013 and an increase of 4% in fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2014 increase was driven by an increase in the value of average ticket (average unit retail) and a slight increase in customer traffic. — Net sales increased to $27.4 billion for fiscal 2014, up 6% over the 53-week fiscal period last year. The 53rd week increased net sales by 2% in fiscal 2013. At February 1, 2014, the number of stores in operation increased 6% and selling square footage was up 5% over the end of fiscal 2013. — Earnings per share for fiscal 2014 were $2.94 per diluted share, up 15% compared to $2.55 per diluted share in fiscal 2013. This year’s earnings were favorably impacted by $0.11 per share from tax benefits in the third quarter, while the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 added approximately $0.08 per share to that year’s earnings. — Our fiscal 2014 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 12.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase compared to our fiscal 2013 pre-tax margin, which benefitted from the 53rd week by approximately 0.2 percentage points. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2014 improved 0.1 percentage point to 71.5% compared to our fiscal 2013 ratio, which benefitted from the 53rd week by approximately 0.2 percentage points. The improvement over last year was primarily due to levering of expenses on the 3% comp sales increase. — Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2014 decreased 0.1 percentage point from 16.4% in fiscal 2013 to 16.3%. — Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were down 8% at the end of fiscal 2014. — During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 27.0 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In January 2014, our Board of Directors authorized our 15th stock repurchase program for an additional $2 billion. 24 The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Adjusted measures exclude certain items affecting comparability. See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 totaled $27.4 billion, a 6% increase over $25.9 billion in fiscal 2013. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 3% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from STP, offset by a 2% decrease attributable to the 53rd week included in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 net sales. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013 totaled $25.9 billion, a 12% increase over $23.2 billion in fiscal 2012. The increase reflected a 7% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 2% increase from the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2013 net sales. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2014 were driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in customer traffic. We believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014. Sales from jewelry and accessories, and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2014. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strongest in the West Coast and Florida. Same store sales at TJX Europe were above the consolidated average while same store sales at TJX Canada were below the consolidated average. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2013 were driven by an increase in customer traffic, and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction. Sales of both apparel and home fashions were equally strong. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strong throughout most regions with Florida and the Southwest performing above the consolidated average and virtually all other regions close to the consolidated average. Our foreign segments both posted same store sales increases, with TJX Europe above the consolidated average and TJX Canada below the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation. 25 The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis: Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2014 Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2013 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2012 As reported As reported As reported As adjusted* Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0% Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.5 71.6 72.7 72.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.3 16.4 16.8 16.5 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 Income before provision for income taxes** 12.1 % 11.9 % 10.4 % 10.7% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.94 $ 2.55 $ 1.93 $ 1.99 * See “Adjusted Financial Measures” below. ** Figures may not foot due to rounding. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. — Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Europe and TJX Canada. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.5% in fiscal 2014, 71.6% in fiscal 2013 and 72.7% in fiscal 2012. The 53rd week in fiscal 2013, which benefitted that year’s expense ratio by approximately 0.2 percentage points, impacts year-over-year comparisons. The 0.1 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to slight expense leverage in buying and occupancy costs, as merchandise margins were comparable to the prior year. The 1.1 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to improved merchandise margins, driven by lower markdowns, as well as expense leverage on the strong same store sales increase and the approximately 0.2 percentage points benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.3% in fiscal 2014, 16.4% in fiscal 2013 and 16.8% in fiscal 2012. On an 26 adjusted basis, this ratio was 16.5% in fiscal 2012. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to year-over-year favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted last year’s expense ratio as described below. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to expense leverage on strong same store sales, partially offset by contributions to the TJX Foundation and by expenses related to two third quarter items: a non-cash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual for prior years and a non-operating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 Interest expense $ 57,084 $ 48,582 $ 49,276 Capitalized interest (10,993 ) (7,750 ) (2,593 ) Interest (income) (15,010 ) (11,657 ) (11,035 ) Interest expense, net $ 31,081 $ 29,175 $ 35,648 Interest expense, net increased in fiscal 2014 as a result of the interest cost of the $500 million 2.50% ten-year notes that were issued on May 2, 2013, partially offset by an increase in interest income and an increase in capitalized interest on major capital projects that have not yet been placed in service. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 35.6% in fiscal 2014, 38.0% in fiscal 2013 and 38.0% in fiscal 2012. The decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to fiscal 2014 third quarter tax benefits of approximately $80 million, which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryfowards. See Note L to the consolidated financial statements for more information. These benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 1.4 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points respectively. TJX’s effective rate remained constant for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from an increase in foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, but this benefit was offset by the absence of the benefit in fiscal 2012 due to a net reduction in federal and state tax reserves. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014, a 12% increase over $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013, which in turn was a 27% increase over $1.5 billion in fiscal 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $2.94 in fiscal 2014, $2.55 in fiscal 2013 and $1.93 in fiscal 2012. The tax benefits referred to above added $0.11 per share to net income for fiscal 2014, while the 53rd week benefitted fiscal 2013 earnings per share by $0.08 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and an immaterial impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Our stock repurchase program, which reduces our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefits our earnings per share. We repurchased 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014, 30.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013 and 49.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012. Adjusted Financial Measures: In addition to presenting financial results in conformity with GAAP, we are also presenting certain measures on an “adjusted” basis. We have adjusted certain measures for fiscal 2012 by excluding costs related to the A.J. Wright consolidation incurred in fiscal 2012. These costs include store closing costs, additional operating losses related to the A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2012 and the costs incurred by the Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments to convert former A.J. Wright stores to their banners and hold grand re-opening events for these stores. 27 These adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability. We use these adjusted measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and our Board of Directors uses them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with GAAP for fiscal 2012 is provided below: Fiscal Year 2012 Fiscal Year 2012 As reported As adjusted Dollars in millions, except per share data U.S.$ % of NetSales Adjustments U.S.$* % of NetSales Net sales $ 23,191 $ (9 )(1) $ 23,182 Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 16,854 72.7 % (16 )(2) 16,838 72.6 % Gross profit margin — 27.3 % — 27.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,890 16.8 % (63 )(3) 3,828 16.5 % Income before provision for income taxes $ 2,411 10.4 % $ 69 $ 2,481 10.7 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.93 $ 0.06 (4) $ 1.99 * Figures may not cross-foot due to rounding.

Wright stores to other banners and to hold grand re-openings affected our Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments in fiscal 2012. A reconciliation of adjusted segment margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to segment margin as reported in accordance with GAAP for each of these segments is as follows: Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2012 As reported As adjusted U.S.$ inMillions % of NetSales Adjustments U.S.$ inMillions* % of NetSales Marmaxx segment profit $ 2,073 13.5 % $ 17 (1) $ 2,090 13.6 % HomeGoods segment profit $ 234 10.4 % $ 3 (2) $ 238 10.6 % * Figures may not cross-foot due to rounding. (1) Conversion costs and grand re-opening costs for A.J. Wright stores converted to a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store. (2) Conversion costs and grand re-opening costs for A.J. Wright stores converted to a HomeGoods store. Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX Europe segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe. Late in fiscal 2013 we acquired STP, an off-price Internet retailer in the U.S. The results of STP have been reported with our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. 28 Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 Net sales $ 17,929.6 $ 17,011.4 $ 15,367.5 Segment profit $ 2,612.7 $ 2,486.3 $ 2,073.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.6 % 14.6 % 13.5 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* n/a n/a 13.6 % Increase in same store sales 3 % 6 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

At February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013 STP operated 4 stores with a selling square footage of 83,000. Net sales at Marmaxx increased 5% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 3% in fiscal 2014, on top of a 6% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in average ticket. We believe severe winter weather in many regions of the country, particularly in the fourth quarter, impacted our sales in fiscal 2014. Same store sales were above the chain average for home fashions, and while apparel overall was below the chain average, within apparel, jewelry and accessories were well above the average. Geographically, same store sales were strongest in the West Coast and Florida. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our new e-commerce site, tjmaxx.com. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 6% in fiscal 2013, on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic, with both apparel and home fashions posting solid same store sales gains. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout the country. Segment margin in fiscal 2014 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2013. The 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Excluding the extra week last year, the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin for fiscal 2014, despite higher markdowns taken in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2014 segment margin was reduced by 0.2 percentage points due to the impact of our e-commerce businesses but this decline in margin was largely offset by the benefit of some expense leverage and reduced incentive compensation costs as compared to the prior year. Segment margin was up 1.1 percentage points to 14.6% for fiscal 2013 compared to 13.5% for fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to a 0.6 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, largely due to lower markdowns. The fiscal 2013 segment margin also benefitted from expense leverage (particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.4 percentage points) on strong same store sales growth and the 53rd week which increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. In fiscal 2015, we expect to open approximately 75 new Marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by approximately 3%. 29 HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 Net sales $ 2,993.7 $ 2,657.1 $ 2,244.0 Segment profit $ 386.5 $ 324.6 $ 234.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 12.9 % 12.2 % 10.4 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* n/a n/a 10.6 % Increase in same store sales 7 % 7 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 450 415 374 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 8,865 8,210 7,391 * See “Adjusted Financial Measures” above. HomeGoods’ net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, on top of an 18% increase in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012. Same store sales increased 7% in fiscal 2014, on top of a same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2013. Same store sales growth was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic for fiscal 2014, while same store sales growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic and to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of the average transaction. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 12.9%, up from 12.2% for fiscal 2013. The increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, primarily buying and occupancy costs. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2013 was 12.2%, up from 10.4% for fiscal 2012. The increase was also driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, particularly occupancy and administrative costs, as well as an increase in merchandise margins. The 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 (which excludes the A.J. Wright conversion costs) was 10.6%. In fiscal 2015, we plan a net increase of approximately 35 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7%. A.J. Wright In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed the consolidation of A.J. Wright, our former off-price chain targeting lower middle income customers, converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods banners and closing A.J. Wright’s remaining 72 stores, two distribution centers and home office. These closing costs (primarily lease-related obligations) and A.J. Wright operating losses totaled $49.3 million and were reported as an A.J. Wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Due to the anticipated migration of A.J. Wright customers to our other U.S. segments, A.J. Wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. 30 International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 Net sales $ 2,877.8 $ 2,926.0 $ 2,680.1 Segment profit $ 405.4 $ 414.9 $ 348.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.1 % 14.2 % 13.0 % Increase (decrease) in same store sales 0 % 5 % (1 )% Stores in operation at end of period Winners 227 222 216 HomeSense 91 88 86 Marshalls 27 14 6 Total 345 324 308 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,196 5,115 5,008 HomeSense 1,748 1,698 1,670 Marshalls 666 363 162 Total 7,610 7,176 6,840 Net sales for TJX Canada decreased 2% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by $121 million, or 4 percentage points, in fiscal 2014, as compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales for fiscal 2014 increased 2% as compared to fiscal 2013. Same store sales were flat in fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 5% in fiscal 2013. We believe that unfavorable weather in the first and fourth quarters had a negative impact on same store sales. Net sales for TJX Canada increased 9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2013 compared to a decrease of 1% in fiscal 2012. Segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage point to 14.1% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in segment margin was due to expense deleverage on the flat same store sales, particularly occupancy and administrative costs and the absence of the 53rd week which benefitted fiscal 2013 segment margin by 0.2 percentage points. These factors more than offset the year-over-year favorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges of $14 million and an increase in merchandise margin. Merchandise margin increased for the full year in fiscal 2014 despite the negative impact on fourth quarter merchandise margins caused by the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. TJX Canada buys a significant portion of its merchandise in U.S. dollars. While our inventory hedges help mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, during fiscal 2014, the value of the Canadian dollar depreciated more dramatically beyond the hedges we placed throughout the year and effectively increased the cost of merchandise bought in U.S. dollars during the latter half of fiscal 2014. Segment profit for fiscal 2013 increased to $414.9 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.2 percentage points to 14.2%. The improvement in segment margin was driven by increased merchandise margin, largely due to lower markdowns. This increase in segment margin was partially offset by increased incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2013 segment profit and segment margin. We expect to add a net of approximately 20 stores in Canada in fiscal 2015, including 10 new Marshalls stores, and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 5%. 31 TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 Net sales $ 3,621.6 $ 3,283.9 $ 2,890.7 Segment profit $ 275.5 $ 215.7 $ 68.7 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.6 % 6.6 % 2.4 % Increase in same store sales 6 % 10 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency translation had an immaterial impact on sales growth in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 same store sales increased 6% compared to an increase of 10% in fiscal 2013. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in customer traffic along with an increase in the average transaction. Net sales for TJX Europe increased 14% in fiscal 2013 to $3.3 billion compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2012. Currency translation negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales growth by 2 percentage points. Fiscal 2013 same store sales increased 10% compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2012. Segment profit increased 28% to $275.5 million for fiscal 2014, and segment profit margin increased to 7.6%. The improvement in segment margin was due primarily to expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly occupancy and buying costs and a lower incentive compensation accrual. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory hedges had a negative impact of 0.3 percentage points and the 53rd week last year had a negative impact of 0.2 percentage points, on the year-over-year comparison of segment margin for fiscal 2014. Segment profit more than tripled to $215.7 million for fiscal 2013, and segment profit margin increased to 6.6%. The improvements we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in this segment’s performance as we slowed growth and re-focused on off-price fundamentals continued throughout fiscal 2013. More than half of the improvement in segment margin came from improved merchandise margins, which was virtually all due to lower markdowns. Segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, benefitted from the absence of the fiscal 2012 charges for closing an office facility and the write-off of certain technology systems and other adjustments. The impact of foreign currency translation and the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related hedges was immaterial for fiscal 2013. We expect to add approximately 40 net stores in Europe in fiscal 2015 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 9%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 General corporate expense $ 329.5 $ 335.0 $ 228.3 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall general corporate expense in fiscal 2014 decreased slightly from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due 32 to the absence in fiscal 2014 of approximately $56 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013 (described below). This decline in general corporate expense was largely offset by increases in systems and technology costs, stock compensation and costs relating to our home office relocations. General corporate expense for fiscal 2013 included contributions to the TJX Foundation, an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of STP. These items account for $56 million of the increase in general corporate expense as compared to fiscal 2012. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes increased incentive compensation accruals under our performance-based plans, additional investments in systems and technology and additional costs related to the expansion of our home office facilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,590 million in fiscal 2014, $3,046 million in fiscal 2013 and $1,916 million in fiscal 2012. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 decreased $456 million compared to fiscal 2013. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,686 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $2,416 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $270 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, compared to a source of cash of $239 million in fiscal 2013. This unfavorable impact of $356 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations was primarily due to the timing of the acquisition and payment of year-end inventory. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities unfavorably impacted cash flows by $30 million in fiscal 2014 versus a favorable impact of $269 million in fiscal 2013. This unfavorable impact of $299 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations reflects the change in accrued incentive compensation and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as the result of a settlement with tax authorities. Additionally, operating cash flows decreased by $165 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows of $81 million from the change in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 increased $1,130 million compared to fiscal 2012. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $2,427 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $1,995 million in fiscal 2012, an increase of $432 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a source of cash of $239 million in fiscal 2013, compared to a use of cash of $224 million in fiscal 2012. This change was attributable to faster inventory turns and a reduction in consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the distribution centers, which was down 6% at the end of fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 (excluding STP). The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash by $269 million in fiscal 2013 versus $14 million in fiscal 2012, which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued incentive compensation and accrued pension. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $48 million year-over-year due to the change in deferred income tax provision and income taxes payable which was largely offset by a reduction in operating cash flows of $47 million due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to the timing of rental payments. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores and A.J. Wright. The majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations. The reserve balance was $31.4 million at February 1, 2014 and $45.2 million at February 2, 2013. The cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 33 Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions February 1,2014 February 2,2013 January 28,2012 New stores $ 185.4 $ 170.7 $ 211.6 Store renovations and improvements 308.0 282.7 319.8 Office and distribution centers 453.3 524.8 271.9 Capital expenditures $ 946.7 $ 978.2 $ 803.3 We expect that we will spend approximately $975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2015, including approximately $466 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, $299 million for store renovations and $210 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. We also purchased short-term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2014, we purchased $478 million of such short-term investments, compared to $356 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, $387 million of such short-term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2014 compared to $213 million last year. Investing activities for fiscal 2013 also included the net cash paid in December 2012 for the acquisition of STP, an off-price Internet retailer. During fiscal 2014, after customary post-closing adjustments, the estimated purchase price was reduced by $3 million. The final purchase price, net of cash acquired was $188 million. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,144 million in fiscal 2014, $1,476 million in fiscal 2013 and $1,336 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014 we issued $500 million of 2.5% ten-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $495 million. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for more information. TJX repurchased and retired 27.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion during fiscal 2014, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,471 million to repurchase 27.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014, $1,345 million to repurchase 32.0 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013 and $1,321 million to repurchase 48.4 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2012. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In January 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2015. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.58 per share in fiscal 2014, $0.46 per share in fiscal 2013 and $0.38 per share in fiscal 2012. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $394 million in fiscal 2014, $324 million in fiscal 2013 and $275 million in fiscal 2012. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $146 million in fiscal 2014, $134 million in fiscal 2013 and $219 million in fiscal 2012. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2015 of $0.175 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.70 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent a 21% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2014. We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 1, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.1 billion, of which $395.2 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any 34 undistributed earnings indefinitely. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. Contractual obligations: As of February 1, 2014, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 1,552,789 $ 55,363 $ 486,225 $ 77,125 $ 934,076 Operating lease commitments(2) 7,391,388 1,272,948 2,221,721 1,627,915 2,268,804 Purchase obligations(3) 3,384,821 3,244,330 134,080 6,393 18 Total Obligations $ 12,328,998 $ 4,572,641 $ 2,842,026 $ 1,711,433 $ 3,202,898 (1) Includes estimated interest costs. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2014. Does not include leases reflected in our reserve for former operations. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $334.8 million for employee compensation and benefits and $50.2 million for uncertain tax positions. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except STP. Under the retail method, which results in a weighted average cost, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. 35 Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate were decreased .25 percentage points our fiscal 2014 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $6 million. A change of .25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2014 pension cost by approximately $2 million. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in tax or other benefits laws and regulations, or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2014 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $30 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2013, our casualty insurance program was changed from a fixed premium program to a self-insured program. A self-insured casualty insurance program requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2014 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2014 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $3 million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $14.7 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of February 1, 2014. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for former operations: As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future 36 obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements TJX has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not expect their adoption to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of February 1, 2014, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for fiscal 2014 by approximately $68 million. 37 Equity Price and Other Market Risk The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note J to the consolidated financial statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, which could result in increased required contributions to the plan or increase other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:18.241831
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2015,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015) and February 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014) and our 53-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013). OVERVIEW We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,300 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe). We also operate Sierra Trading Post (STP), a leading off-price Internet retailer that we acquired in late fiscal 2013, which operates sierratradingpost.com and six stores in the U.S. The results of STP have been reported with the Marmaxx segment. Fiscal 2015 was another successful year for TJX as we posted solid gains in net sales and earnings per share on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth. In fiscal 2016, we announced an initiative to raise wages for our U.S. full- and part-time hourly store associates to at least $9.00 per hour beginning in June 2015. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2015 include the following: — Same store sales increased 2% in fiscal 2015 over an increase of 3% in fiscal 2014 and an increase of 7% in fiscal 2013. The fiscal 2015 increase was driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and in customer traffic. — Net sales increased to $29.1 billion for fiscal 2015, up 6% over the same period last year. Net sales increased to $27.4 billion for fiscal 2014, up 6% over the 53-week fiscal period in fiscal 2013. At January 31, 2015, the number of stores in operation and selling square footage increased 5% over the end of fiscal 2014. — Earnings per share for fiscal 2015 were $3.15 per diluted share compared to $2.94 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 earnings per share reflect a charge of $0.01 from a loss on early extinguishment of debt. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2014 included an $0.11 per share benefit resulting from tax benefits recognized in the third quarter. — Our fiscal 2015 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 12.2%, a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to our fiscal 2014 pre-tax margin. The loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced pre-tax margin by 0.1 percentage point in fiscal 2015. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2015 was 71.5%, flat compared to the fiscal 2014 ratio. Merchandise margins were slightly up in fiscal 2015. — Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2015 decreased 0.2 percentage points from 16.3% in fiscal 2014 to 16.1%. — Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were up 3% at the end of fiscal 2015. — During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 27.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In January 2015, our Board of Directors authorized our 16th stock repurchase program for an additional $2 billion. 24 The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $29.1 billion, a 6% increase over $27.4 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 2% increase from same store sales. Foreign currency exchange rates and e-commerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 totaled $27.4 billion, a 6% increase over $25.9 billion in fiscal 2013. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 3% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from STP, offset by a 2% decrease attributable to the 53rd week included in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 net sales. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic. In fiscal 2015, within apparel, sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well, as did home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest. Same store sales increases at TJX Europe and TJX Canada were above the consolidated average. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2014 were driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in customer traffic. We believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014. Sales from jewelry and accessories, and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2014. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strongest in the West Coast and Florida. Same store sales increases at TJX Europe were above the consolidated average while TJX Canada was below the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. The sales of Sierra Trading Post, tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com are not included in same store sales. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation. 25 The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales: Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2015 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2014 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2013 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.5 71.5 71.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.1 16.3 16.4 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 0.1 — — Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes* 12.2 % 12.1 % 11.9 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.15 $ 2.94 $ 2.55 * Figures may not foot due to rounding. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. — Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX Europe. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. We discuss the effect of these foreign currency issues on our actual results throughout this discussion. As a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and resulting change in foreign currency exchange rates in late fiscal 2015, if rates were to stay at or near those levels in the coming year, we expect fiscal 2016 results would be negatively impacted to a much greater extent than historically experienced. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 71.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and was 71.6% in fiscal 2013. There was a slight increase in merchandise margins in fiscal 2015. The 53rd week in fiscal 2013, which benefitted that year’s expense ratio by approximately 0.2 percentage points, impacts year-over-year comparisons. The 0.1 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to slight expense leverage in buying and occupancy costs, as merchandise margins were comparable to the prior year. 26 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.1% in fiscal 2015, 16.3% in fiscal 2014 and 16.4% in fiscal 2013. The reduction in this ratio is largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015, as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to year-over-year favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted the fiscal 2013 expense ratio. Fiscal 2013 included a non-cash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual, a non-operating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores and contributions to the TJX Foundation. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: On July 8, 2014, we redeemed our $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due August 2015 and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 Interest expense $ 64,783 $ 57,084 $ 48,582 Capitalized interest (9,403 ) (10,993 ) (7,750 ) Interest (income) (15,593 ) (15,010 ) (11,657 ) Interest expense, net $ 39,787 $ 31,081 $ 29,175 The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance (June 5, 2014) on the $750 million 2.75% seven-year notes. In addition, fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the $500 million 2.50% ten-year notes, compared to fiscal 2014, which only reflected nine months of interest expense. These costs were partially offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the $400 million 4.20% notes. The reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.6% in fiscal 2015, 35.6% in fiscal 2014 and 38.0% in fiscal 2013. The increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately $80 million, which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 1.4 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the tax benefits described above. See Note L to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015, a 4% increase over $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014, which in turn was a 12% increase over $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $3.15 in fiscal 2015, $2.94 in fiscal 2014 and $2.55 in fiscal 2013. The after-tax cost for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.01 per share. The tax benefits referred to above added $0.11 per share to net income for fiscal 2014, while the 53rd week benefited fiscal 2013 earnings per share by $0.08 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share for both fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2015 by 4%. We repurchased 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015, 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014 and 30.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013. 27 Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods segments both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX Europe segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe. We also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores in the U.S. The results of STP have been included with our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 31,2015 February 1, 2014 February 2, 2013 Net sales $ 18,687.9 $ 17,929.6 $ 17,011.4 Segment profit $ 2,736.7 $ 2,612.7 $ 2,486.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.6 % 14.6 % 14.6 % Increase in same store sales 1 % 3 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 1,119 1,079 1,036 Marshalls 975 942 904 Total Marmaxx 2,094 2,021 1,940 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 25,461 24,712 23,894 Marshalls 23,715 23,092 22,380 Total Marmaxx 49,176 47,804 46,274 At January 31, 2015, STP operated six stores with a selling square footage of 122,000. At February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, STP operated four stores with a selling square footage of 83,000. Net sales at Marmaxx increased 4% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase reflected a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2015 is on top of a 3% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight increase in customer traffic. Same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average. Within apparel, jewelry and accessories and activewear were well above the average. Geographically, same store sales increases were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 3% in fiscal 2014, on top of a 6% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in average ticket. We believe severe winter weather in many regions of the country, particularly in the fourth quarter, impacted our sales in fiscal 2014. Same store sales were above the chain average for home fashions, and while apparel overall was below the chain average, within apparel, jewelry and accessories were well above the average. Geographically, same store sales were strongest in the West Coast and Florida. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our e-commerce site, tjmaxx.com. Segment margin in fiscal 2015 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2014. Improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our e-commerce businesses and expense deleverage, primarily occupancy costs, on the 1% same store sales growth. 28 Segment margin in fiscal 2014 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2013. The 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Excluding the extra week in fiscal 2013, the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin for fiscal 2014, despite higher markdowns taken in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2014 segment margin was reduced by 0.2 percentage points due to the impact of our e-commerce businesses but this decline in margin was largely offset by the benefit of some expense leverage and reduced incentive compensation costs as compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2016, we expect to open approximately 70 new Marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by approximately 3%. HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 Net sales $ 3,414.4 $ 2,993.7 $ 2,657.1 Segment profit $ 463.2 $ 386.5 $ 324.6 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.6 % 12.9 % 12.2 % Increase in same store sales 7 % 7 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 487 450 415 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 9,537 8,865 8,210 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, on top of a 13% increase in fiscal 2014 when compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2015 reflected a 7% increase from new stores and a 7% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2015 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2014. Same store sales growth in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2015 was 13.6%, up from 12.9% for fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, (primarily buying and occupancy costs, and administrative costs,) as well as an increase in merchandise margins. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 12.9%, up from 12.2% for fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, particularly buying and occupancy costs. The 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. In fiscal 2016, we plan a net increase of 40 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8%. 29 International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 Net sales $ 2,883.9 $ 2,877.8 $ 2,926.0 Segment profit $ 393.6 $ 405.4 $ 414.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.6 % 14.1 % 14.2 % Increase in same store sales 3 % 0 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 234 227 222 HomeSense 96 91 88 Marshalls 38 27 14 Total 368 345 324 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,310 5,196 5,115 HomeSense 1,824 1,748 1,698 Marshalls 914 666 363 Total 8,048 7,610 7,176 Net sales for TJX Canada in fiscal 2015 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2014. While net sales reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 3% increase from same store sales, these were offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 7%. The same store sales increase of 3% in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales were flat in fiscal 2014. Net sales for TJX Canada decreased 2% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2013. Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.6% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise margins and the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives, which collectively reduced segment margin by 0.8 percentage points. The decrease in merchandise margin was driven by changes in currency exchange rates which increased TJX Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. We expect this increase in the cost of merchandise purchased with U.S. dollars will likely continue into fiscal 2016 based on the recent trend in currency exchange rates. The decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs, along with a reduction in advertising costs as a percentage of sales. Segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage points to 14.1% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in segment margin was due to expense deleverage on the flat same store sales, particularly occupancy and administrative costs and the absence of the 53rd week which benefited fiscal 2013 segment margin by 0.2 percentage points. These factors more than offset the year-over-year favorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives of $14 million and an increase in merchandise margin. In fiscal 2016, we plan a net increase of approximately 20 stores in Canada and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 4%. 30 TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 Net sales $ 4,092.3 $ 3,621.6 $ 3,283.9 Segment profit $ 337.4 $ 275.5 $ 215.7 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 8.2 % 7.6 % 6.6 % Increase in same store sales 3 % 6 % 10 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K. Maxx 407 371 343 HomeSense 33 28 24 Total 440 399 367 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.K. Maxx 9,109 8,383 7,830 HomeSense 545 464 411 Total 9,654 8,847 8,241 Net sales for TJX Europe increased 13% in fiscal 2015 to $4.1 billion compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2014 on top of a 10% increase in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2015 reflected an 8% increase from new store sales, 3% from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact from currency translation. The fiscal 2015 same store sales increase of 3% compares to an increase of 6% in fiscal 2014 and a 10% increase in fiscal 2013. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. Net sales for TJX Europe increased 10% in fiscal 2014 to $3.6 billion compared to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2013. Currency translation had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 sales growth. Segment profit increased 22% to $337.4 million for fiscal 2015, and segment profit margin increased to 8.2% compared to 7.6% in fiscal 2014. The improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. The increase in segment margin was also largely due to the positive impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives. These margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016. Segment profit increased 28% to $275.5 million for fiscal 2014, and segment margin increased to 7.6%. The improvement in segment margin was due primarily to expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs and a lower incentive compensation accrual. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives had a negative impact of 0.3 percentage points and the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 had a negative impact of 0.2 percentage points on the year-over-year comparison of segment margin for fiscal 2014. We expect to add approximately 50 stores (net of closings) in Europe in fiscal 2015 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 10%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 General corporate expense $ 324.4 $ 329.5 $ 335.0 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. Virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall general corporate expense in fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior year. This decrease reflects a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations in fiscal 2015 as well as 31 costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. These reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the TJX Foundation. General corporate expense for fiscal 2014 decreased slightly from the prior year primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2014 of approximately $56 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2013 included contributions to the TJX Foundation, an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of STP. This decline in general corporate expense was largely offset by increases in systems and technology costs, stock compensation and costs relating to our home office relocations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,008 million in fiscal 2015, $2,600 million in fiscal 2014 and $3,056 million in fiscal 2013. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased $408 million compared to fiscal 2014. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $2,686 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $118 million. The change in the deferred income tax provision, which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan of $150 million in fiscal 2015, favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by $50 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, compared to a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, favorably impacting year-over-year cash flows by $70 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases. The improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that will be paid for in the following fiscal year. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $30 million in fiscal 2014. This favorable impact of $51 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven by last year’s payment of approximately $80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $122 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable and recoverable which is largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 decreased $456 million compared to fiscal 2013. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,686 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $2,416 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $270 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, compared to a source of cash of $239 million in fiscal 2013. This unfavorable impact of $356 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations was primarily due to the timing of the receipt and payment of year-end inventory. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities unfavorably impacted operating cash flows by $30 million in fiscal 2014 versus a favorable impact of $269 million in fiscal 2013. This unfavorable impact of $299 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations reflects the change in accrued incentive compensation and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as the result of a settlement with tax authorities. Additionally, operating cash flows decreased by $165 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable, which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows of $81 million from the change in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores and A.J. Wright. The majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations. The reserve balance was $14.6 million at January 31, 2015 and $31.4 million at February 1, 2014. The cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 32 Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions January 31,2015 February 1,2014 February 2,2013 New stores $ 201.5 $ 185.4 $ 170.7 Store renovations and improvements 266.8 308.0 282.7 Office and distribution centers 443.2 453.3 524.8 Capital expenditures $ 911.5 $ 946.7 $ 978.2 We expect that we will spend approximately $975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, including approximately $487 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, $277 million for store renovations and $211 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. In fiscal 2015, we purchased $431 million of investments, compared to $497 million in fiscal 2014. Additionally, $388 million of such investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2015 compared to $395 million last year. This activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. We have entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a new home office facility in Canada. We are deemed the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes and therefore the construction costs incurred to date by the lessor of $60.7 million are included as a construction in progress asset along with a related liability of the same amount on our balance sheet. The asset is included in “land and buildings” and the liability is included in “other long-term liabilities.” See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,560 million in fiscal 2015, $1,144 million in fiscal 2014 and $1,476 million in fiscal 2013. In June 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% seven-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $743 million. In July 2014, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2.75% seven-year notes to redeem the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes paying $416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes. In fiscal 2014, we issued $500 million of 2.5% ten-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $495 million. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for more information. TJX repurchased and retired 27.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2015, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,651 million to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015, $1,471 million to repurchase 27.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014 and $1,345 million to repurchase 32.0 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2016. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015, $0.58 per share in fiscal 2014 and $0.46 per share in fiscal 2013. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $466 million in fiscal 2015, $394 million in fiscal 2014 and $324 million in fiscal 2013. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $143 million in fiscal 2015, $146 million in fiscal 2014 and $134 million in fiscal 2013. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2016 of $0.21 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.84 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent a 20% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2015. 33 We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, of which $413.9 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. We have provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Australia. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. For all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. We have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. Contractual obligations: As of January 31, 2015, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 2,069,095 $ 63,840 $ 128,524 $ 490,493 $ 1,386,238 Operating lease commitments(2) 7,609,001 1,303,196 2,254,336 1,702,764 2,348,705 Purchase obligations(3) 3,094,338 2,906,035 162,522 21,181 4,600 Total Obligations $ 12,772,434 $ 4,273,071 $ 2,545,382 $ 2,214,438 $ 3,739,543 (1) Includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligation. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2015. Does not include leases reflected in our reserve for former operations. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $460.1 million for employee compensation and benefits and $28.1 million for uncertain tax positions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except STP. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. 34 Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. These assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate were decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2015 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $6 million. Similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a reduction of pension cost of a similar amount. A change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2015 pension cost by approximately $2 million. During fiscal 2015, we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality (the expected lives of our pension participants) in light of new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries which project longer life expectancies. The change in our mortality assumptions added $59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of January 31, 2015 and will add approximately $7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2015, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $150 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. A 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 4% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 5%. Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2013, our casualty insurance program was changed from a fixed premium program to a self-insured program. A self-insured casualty insurance program requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2015 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2015 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $14.3 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 31, 2015. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain 35 tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for former operations: As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for recently issued accounting standards, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 36 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes or using any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 31, 2015, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for fiscal 2015 by approximately $73 million. EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISK The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note J to the consolidated financial statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:18.898561
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016), January 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015) and February 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014). OVERVIEW We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,600 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International, formerly TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and Trade Secret in Australia). In the U.S. we also operate Sierra Trading Post (STP), a leading off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment. Fiscal 2016 was another successful year for TJX as we posted strong gains in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, and while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth. In fiscal 2016, we implemented the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for our U.S. full- and part-time hourly store associates. The second phase of additional wage increases will occur in fiscal 2017. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2016 include the following: — Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2016 over an increase of 2% in fiscal 2015 and an increase of 3% in fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2016 increase was driven by an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. — Net sales increased to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2016, up 6% over the same period last year. Net sales increased to $29.1 billion for fiscal 2015, up 6% over the prior year. At January 30, 2016, the number of stores in operation increased 6% and selling square footage increased 5% over the end of fiscal 2015. — Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 were $3.33 per diluted share compared to $3.15 per diluted share in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2015 earnings per share includes a charge of $0.01 from a loss on early extinguishment of debt. — Our fiscal 2016 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 11.8%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease compared to our fiscal 2015 pre-tax margin. The loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced pre-tax margin by 0.1 percentage point in fiscal 2015. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2016 was 71.2%, a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared to the fiscal 2015 ratio. This improvement was driven by buying and occupancy expense leverage on strong same store sales growth as well as an increase in merchandise margin. — Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2016 increased 0.7 percentage points to 16.8% from 16.1% in fiscal 2015. This increase is primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to our wage initiative and the impact of handling a large increase in units sold. — Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were up 5% (up 6% on a constant currency basis) at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year. — During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 26.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.8 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized our 17th stock repurchase program for an additional $2.0 billion. 25 The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over $29.1 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 5% increase from same store sales, offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses amount to approximately 1% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2016 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $29.1 billion, a 6% increase over $27.4 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 2% increase from same store sales. Foreign currency exchange rates and e-commerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2016, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was slightly below the consolidated average. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic. In fiscal 2015, within apparel, sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well, as did home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest. Same store sales increases at TJX International and TJX Canada were above the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. The sales of Sierra Trading Post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com (our e-commerce businesses) are not included in same store sales. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. The newly acquired Trade Secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation. 26 The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Fiscal Year 2014 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.2 71.5 71.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.1 16.3 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 0.1 — Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes* 11.8 % 12.2 % 12.1 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.33 $ 3.15 $ 2.94 * Figures may not foot due to rounding. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period. — Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency.” This does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange.” Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.2% in fiscal 2016 compared to 71.5% in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. The improvement in this expense ratio was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase along with an increase on our profit margin on merchandise sold (merchandise margin). Together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for Canada and Europe this year versus last year. The change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by Canada and Europe that were denominated in currencies other than their local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. This expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to 27 market of inventory derivatives. The fiscal 2015 expense ratio was comparable to that of fiscal 2014 with a slight increase in the fiscal 2015 merchandise margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2016, 16.1% in fiscal 2015 and 16.3% in fiscal 2014. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to our wage initiative and an increase in units handled at the stores, along with our incremental investments and increased contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations. The reduction in this ratio for fiscal 2015 was largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015, as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: On July 8, 2014, we redeemed our $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due August 2015 and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 Interest expense $ 68,253 $ 64,783 $ 57,084 Capitalized interest (7,984 ) (9,403 ) (10,993 ) Interest (income) (13,869 ) (15,593 ) (15,010 ) Interest expense, net $ 46,400 $ 39,787 $ 31,081 The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to TJX Canada’s new home office of $3.7 million. The increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in the fiscal 2016 periods as compared to the same periods last year. The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance (June 5, 2014) on the $750 million 2.75% seven-year notes. In addition, fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the $500 million 2.50% ten-year notes, compared to fiscal 2014, which only reflected nine months of interest expense. These costs were partially offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the $400 million 4.20% notes. The reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2016, 37.6% in fiscal 2015 and 35.6% in fiscal 2014. The increase in the fiscal 2016 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. The increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately $80 million, which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016, a 3% increase over $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015, which in turn was a 4% increase over $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $3.33 in fiscal 2016, $3.15 in fiscal 2015 and $2.94 in fiscal 2014. The after-tax cost for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.01 per share. The tax benefits referred to above added $0.11 to earnings per share for fiscal 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.09 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015, and a $0.02 negative impact in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014. 28 Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2016 by approximately 3%. We repurchased 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015 and 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014. Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods segments both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. In the U.S., we also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. We currently consider all of STP, including its limited number of stores, as part of our e-commerce businesses. The results of STP have been included in our Marmaxx segment. The former TJX Europe segment has been renamed TJX International to reflect the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 30, 2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 Net sales $ 19,948.2 $ 18,687.9 $ 17,929.6 Segment profit $ 2,858.8 $ 2,736.7 $ 2,612.7 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.3 % 14.6 % 14.6 % Increase in same store sales 4 % 1 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 1,156 1,119 1,079 Marshalls 1,007 975 942 Total Marmaxx 2,163 2,094 2,021 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 26,158 25,461 24,712 Marshalls 24,308 23,715 23,092 Total Marmaxx 50,466 49,176 47,804 At January 30, 2016, STP operated eight stores with selling square footage of 159,000. At January 31, 2015, STP operated six stores with selling square footage of 122,000. At February 1, 2014, STP operated four stores with selling square footage of 83,000. Net sales at Marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 3% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 is on top of a 1% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was driven by an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast region particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 1% in fiscal 2015, on top of a 3% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight 29 increase in customer traffic. Same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average. Within apparel, jewelry and accessories and activewear were well above the average. Geographically, same store sales increases were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest. Segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 14.3% compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage on same store sales growth of approximately 0.6 percentage points. However, these gains were offset by higher distribution costs, reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll, primarily due to our wage initiative, and processing more units at the store level. In addition, tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) had a negative impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons of 0.3 percentage points. Our e-commerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at STP, we incurred additional costs as we work to transition this business to be less promotional to align more closely with our off-price model and to adjust its merchandise mix. Overall, e-commerce sales represent less than 2% of Marmaxx’s net sales. Segment margin in fiscal 2015 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2014. Improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our e-commerce businesses and expense deleverage, primarily occupancy costs, on the 1% same store sales growth. In fiscal 2017, we expect to open approximately 60 Marmaxx stores and increase selling square footage by approximately 2%. HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 Net sales $ 3,915.2 $ 3,414.4 $ 2,993.7 Segment profit $ 549.3 $ 463.2 $ 386.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.0 % 13.6 % 12.9 % Increase in same store sales 8 % 7 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 526 487 450 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 10,234 9,537 8,865 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2016, on top of a 14% increase in fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 7% increase from new store sales and an 8% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 8% in fiscal 2016 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2015. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.0%, up from 13.6% for fiscal 2015. The growth in segment margin for fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2015 was 13.6%, up from 12.9% for fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, due to buying and occupancy costs as well as administrative costs, and an increase in merchandise margins. In fiscal 2017, we plan an increase of approximately 50 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8%. 30 Foreign Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 Net sales $ 2,854.6 $ 2,883.9 $ 2,877.8 Segment profit $ 375.3 $ 393.6 $ 405.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.1 % 13.6 % 14.1 % Increase in same store sales 12 % 3 % 0 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 245 234 227 HomeSense 101 96 91 Marshalls 41 38 27 Total 387 368 345 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,470 5,310 5,196 HomeSense 1,900 1,824 1,748 Marshalls 975 914 666 Total 8,345 8,048 7,610 Net sales for TJX Canada in fiscal 2016 were down 1% compared to fiscal 2015. While net sales reflected a 3% increase from new store sales and a 12% increase from same store sales, these were more than offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 16%. The same store sales increase of 12% in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2015. Net sales for TJX Canada were essentially flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a 4% increase from new store sales and a 3% increase in same store sales were completely offset by a 7% negative impact from foreign currency. Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.1% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins, the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the above-plan performance. Collectively, these items reduced segment margin by 1.2 percentage points. The decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased TJX Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. These declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.6% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise margins and the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives, which collectively reduced segment margin by 0.8 percentage points. The decline in merchandise margin in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was also largely related to transactional foreign exchange. The decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs, along with a reduction in advertising costs as a percentage of sales. In fiscal 2017, we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in Canada and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7%. 31 TJX International Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 Net sales $ 4,226.9 $ 4,092.3 $ 3,621.6 Segment profit $ 316.9 $ 337.4 $ 275.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.5 % 8.2 % 7.6 % Increase in same store sales 4 % 3 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

The increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 10%. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. Net sales for TJX International increased 13% in fiscal 2015 to $4.1 billion compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 reflected an 8% increase from new store sales, a 3% increase from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Segment profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 7.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the strong same stores sales increase, which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin. The investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business, investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans, our new store openings in Austria and the Netherlands and the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia. Segment profit margin increased 0.6 percentage points to 8.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives also had a positive impact. These margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016. We expect to add approximately 50 stores to TJX International in fiscal 2017 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 General corporate expense $ 395.6 $ 324.4 $ 329.5 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. Virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Increased contributions to the TJX charitable foundations, higher incentive 32 compensation accruals due to our above-plan performance and costs related to the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia accounted for approximately $61 million of the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. General corporate expense for fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior year primarily due to a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. These reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the TJX Foundation. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,937 million in fiscal 2016, $3,008 million in fiscal 2015 and $2,600 million in fiscal 2014. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by $71 million compared to fiscal 2015. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,894 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2,804 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $90 million. The change in the deferred income tax provision unfavorably impacted year-over-year cash flows by $71 million, which was driven by the deferred tax impact of the higher contributions to the pension plan in fiscal 2015. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, negatively impacting year-over-year cash flows by $243 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of $166 million in fiscal 2015. This favorable impact of $187 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional $100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2016. Lastly, fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased $408 million compared to fiscal 2014. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $2,686 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $118 million. The change in the deferred income tax provision, which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan of $150 million in fiscal 2015, favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by $50 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, compared to a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, favorably impacting year-over-year cash flows by $70 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases. The improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that was paid for in the following fiscal year. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $30 million in fiscal 2014. This favorable impact of $51 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven by a payment in fiscal 2015 of approximately $80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $122 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable and recoverable, which was largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision. 33 Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions January 30,2016 January 31,2015 February 1,2014 New stores $ 199.1 $ 201.5 $ 185.4 Store renovations and improvements 299.7 266.8 308.0 Office and distribution centers 390.6 443.2 453.3 Capital expenditures $ 889.4 $ 911.5 $ 946.7 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 will be approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $600 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, approximately $300 million for store renovations and approximately $200 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. In fiscal 2016, we purchased $798 million of investments, compared to $431 million in fiscal 2015. Additionally, $681 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2016 compared to $388 million in the prior year. The increased investment activity in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of changing the investments of our Executive Savings Plan. This change in investments resulted in $154 million of assets being liquidated and then reinvested in new investment options. The balance of this activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. Finally, investing activities include the initial payment of $57 million for the acquisition of Trade Secret. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $2,176 million in fiscal 2016, $1,560 million in fiscal 2015 and $1,144 million in fiscal 2014. TJX repurchased and retired 26.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.8 billion during fiscal 2016, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 26.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016, $1.7 billion to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015 and $1.5 billion to repurchase 27.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In February 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2017. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.84 per share in fiscal 2016, $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015 and $0.58 per share in fiscal 2014. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $544 million in fiscal 2016, $466 million in fiscal 2015 and $394 million in fiscal 2014. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $132 million in fiscal 2016, $143 million in fiscal 2015 and $146 million in fiscal 2014. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2017 of $0.26 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.04 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent a 24% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2016. In June 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% seven-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $743 million. In July 2014, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2.75% seven-year notes to redeem the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes paying $416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes. In fiscal 2014, we issued $500 million of 2.50% ten-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $495 million. See Note J to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 34 We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, of which $355.4 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. We have provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India and Hong Kong. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we would not expect to incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. For all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. We have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. Our credit facilities were amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and are more fully described in Note J to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual obligations: As of January 30, 2016, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 2,089,437 $ 63,950 $ 136,723 $ 473,313 $ 1,415,451 Operating lease commitments(2) 7,997,821 1,368,050 2,424,060 1,851,037 2,354,674 Purchase obligations(3) 3,075,339 2,894,674 161,346 19,308 11 Total obligations $ 13,162,597 $ 4,326,674 $ 2,722,129 $ 2,343,658 $ 3,770,136 (1) Includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligations. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2016. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $418.2 million for employee compensation and benefits, and $33.4 million for uncertain tax positions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except STP and Trade Secret. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the 35 fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. These assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2016 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $8 million. Similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost. A change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2016 pension cost by approximately $3 million. During fiscal 2015, we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality (the expected lives of our pension participants) in light of new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries which project longer life expectancies. The change in our mortality assumptions added $59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of January 31, 2015 and added approximately $7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2016, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $50 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. A 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 4% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 5%. Casualty insurance: Our casualty insurance program is a self-insured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2016 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2016 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $19.7 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 30, 2016. 36 Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting standards, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and 37 swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for the fiscal year by approximately $69 million and $73 million, respectively. EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISK The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I to the consolidated financial statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:18.639349

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016) and January 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015). OVERVIEW We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,800 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International, (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and Trade Secret in Australia). In the U.S. we also operate Sierra Trading Post (STP), an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment. Fiscal 2017 was another successful year for TJX. We posted a strong increase in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we continue to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth, and we implemented the second phase of our wage initiative to raise wages for U.S. hourly store associates. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2017 include the following: — Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2017 over an increase of 5% in fiscal 2016 and an increase of 2% in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2017 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic. — Net sales increased to $33.2 billion for fiscal 2017, up 7% over the same period last year. Net sales increased to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2016, up 6% over the prior year. At January 28, 2017, the number of stores in operation increased 5% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2016. — Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 were $3.46 per diluted share compared to $3.33 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 earnings per share was reduced by $0.07 from a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a pension settlement charge during the third quarter. — Our fiscal 2017 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 11.2%, a 0.6 percentage point decrease compared to our fiscal 2016 pre-tax margin. The two third quarter charges reduced pre-tax margin by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2017. — Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2017 was 71.0%, a 0.2 percentage point decrease compared to the fiscal 2016 ratio. This improvement was driven by an increase in merchandise margin. — Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2017 increased 0.6 percentage points to 17.4% from 16.8% in fiscal 2016. This increase is primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. — Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were down 5% (down 4% on a constant currency basis) at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year. — During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 22.3 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized our 18th stock repurchase program for an additional $1.0 billion. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled $33.2 billion, a 7% increase over $30.9 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, 25 offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses amount to approximately 1% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2017 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over $29.1 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2017, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast and the Great Lakes regions reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was below the consolidated average. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2016, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was slightly below the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. The sales of our e-commerce businesses, meaning Sierra Trading Post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com, are not included in same store sales. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. The recently acquired Trade Secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.0 71.2 71.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 17.4 16.8 16.1 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 0.2 — 0.1 Pension settlement charge 0.1 — — Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes* 11.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.46 $ 3.33 $ 3.15 * Figures may not foot due to rounding. 26 Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period. — Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency.” This does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange.” Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 71.2% in fiscal 2016 and 71.5% in fiscal 2015. The improvement in this expense ratio was driven by an increase in our profit margin on merchandise sold (merchandise margin) along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase. Together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year. Although not as significant as in fiscal 2016, the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segments’ local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. These improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the mark to market of inventory derivatives. The improvement in the fiscal 2016 expense ratio as compared to fiscal 2015 was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase along with an increase in merchandise margin. Similar to fiscal 2017, together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for TJX Canada and Europe for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. The change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by TJX Canada and Europe that were denominated in currencies other than the divisions’ respective local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. This expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to market of inventory derivatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.4% in fiscal 2017, 16.8% in fiscal 2016 and 16.1% in fiscal 2015. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to wage 27 increases, investments to support our growth and supply chain costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the TJX charitable foundations in fiscal 2017. Similar to fiscal 2017, the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to our wage initiative and an increase in supply chain costs, along with our incremental investments. In addition the fiscal 2016 expense ratio was unfavorably impacted by higher contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: On September 12, 2016 we issued $1.0 billion of 2.25% ten year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes on October 12, 2016, prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019. We recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million. Pension settlement charge: During the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we offered eligible former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. On October 21, 2016, TJX’s qualified pension plan paid $103.2 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer. This transaction had no cash impact on TJX, but did result in a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $31.2 million. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 Interest expense $ 69,219 $ 68,253 $ 64,783 Capitalized interest (7,548 ) (7,984 ) (9,403 ) Interest (income) (18,137 ) (13,869 ) (15,593 ) Interest expense, net $ 43,534 $ 46,400 $ 39,787 The decrease in net interest expense for fiscal 2017 is due to additional interest income as a result of an increase in investments as well as an increase in interest rates. The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to TJX Canada’s new home office of $3.7 million. The increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.3% in fiscal 2017, 37.7% in fiscal 2016 and 37.6% in fiscal 2015. The increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. In addition, the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new Tangible Property Regulations. The increase in the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017, a 1% increase over $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016, which in turn was a 3% increase over $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $3.46 in fiscal 2017, $3.33 in fiscal 2016 and $3.15 in fiscal 2015. The third quarter charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement, collectively reduced fiscal 2017 net income by $50.0 million, or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.07 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016, and a $0.09 negative impact in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in each fiscal year. We repurchased 22.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017, 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015. 28 Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods segments both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. In the U.S., we also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. We currently consider all of STP, including its limited number of stores, as part of our e-commerce businesses. The results of STP have been included in our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, the pension settlement charge and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 Net sales $ 21,246.0 $ 19,948.2 $ 18,687.9 Segment profit $ 2,995.0 $ 2,858.8 $ 2,736.7 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.1 % 14.3 % 14.6 % Increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Maxx 26,614 26,158 25,461 Marshalls 24,750 24,308 23,715 STP 227 159 122 Total 51,591 50,625 49,298 Net sales at Marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 2% increase from new store sales. The same store sales increase of 5% in fiscal 2017 is on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was largely offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast and Great Lakes regions particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2017 with both categories posting same store sales growth. Overall, e-commerce sales represent approximately 2% of Marmaxx’s net sales. The same store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 was on top of a 1% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was due to an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast region particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth. Segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 14.1% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2016. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage, on same store 29 sales growth, of approximately 0.7 percentage points. However, these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level, higher distribution costs, as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs. Tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. Segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 14.3%, compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect improvements in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage, on same store sales growth, of approximately 0.6 percentage points. However, these gains were offset by higher distribution costs, reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll, primarily due to our wage initiative, and processing more units at the store level. In addition, tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) had a negative impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons of 0.3 percentage points. Our e-commerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at STP, we incurred additional costs as we continue to transition this business to a more fully off-price model and to adjust its merchandise mix. In fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 65 Marmaxx stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%. HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 Net sales $ 4,404.6 $ 3,915.2 $ 3,414.4 Segment profit $ 613.8 $ 549.3 $ 463.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.9 % 14.0 % 13.6 % Increase in same store sales 6 % 8 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 579 526 487 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 11,119 10,234 9,537 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 12% in fiscal 2017, on top of a 15% increase in fiscal 2016. The increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 6% increase from new store sales. The sales increase of 15% in fiscal 2016 reflected a same store sales increase of 8% and an increase from new stores of 7%. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 13.9% compared to 14.0% for fiscal 2016. Segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage, primarily occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth. These increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases, an increase in distribution costs, which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017, and an increase in credit card chargeback costs. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.0%, up from 13.6% for fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative. In fiscal 2018, we plan an increase of approximately 81 HomeGoods stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11%. We also plan on launching a new U.S. home concept, with the first few stores opening later in fiscal 2018. 30 Foreign Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 Net sales $ 3,171.1 $ 2,854.6 $ 2,883.9 Segment profit $ 413.4 $ 375.3 $ 393.6 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.0 % 13.1 % 13.6 % Increase in same store sales 8 % 12 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 255 245 234 HomeSense 106 101 96 Marshalls 57 41 38 Total 418 387 368 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,629 5,470 5,310 HomeSense 1,984 1,900 1,824 Marshalls 1,307 975 914 Total 8,920 8,345 8,048 Net sales for TJX Canada increased 11% in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 1% in fiscal 2016. The increase in sales for fiscal 2017 reflected same store sales growth of 8% and a 5% increase from new stores offset by 2% from the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The decrease in net sales of 1% in fiscal 2016 was due entirely to currency translation which negatively impacted sales growth by 16%, more than offsetting sales growth of 12% from same store sales and an increase of 3% from new stores. The same store sales increases in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage point to 13.0% in fiscal 2017. The decline in segment margin was driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher supply chain and distribution center costs, which included the opening of a new distribution center. The decline in merchandise margin, similar to the prior year, was primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased TJX Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. These declines in segment margin were largely offset by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on the same store sales growth, as well as the benefit of transactional foreign currency activity resulting in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 as compared to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016. These foreign currency gains and losses result from the timing and settlement of payables denominated in currencies other than the Canadian Dollar. Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.1% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins, the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the above-plan performance. Collectively, these items reduced segment margin by 1.2 percentage points. The decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased TJX Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. These declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. In fiscal 2018, we plan an increase of approximately 35 stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 7%. 31 TJX International Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 Net sales $ 4,362.0 $ 4,226.9 $ 4,092.3 Segment profit $ 235.5 $ 316.9 $ 337.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 5.4 % 7.5 % 8.2 % Increase in same store sales 2 % 4 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

The increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 12% increase from new store sales (which includes Trade Secret for the full fiscal year) and a 2% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 11%. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. Net sales for TJX International increased 3% in fiscal 2016 to $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10%. Overall, e-commerce sales represent approximately 2% of TJX International’s net sales. Segment profit margin decreased 2.1% percentage points to 5.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The inclusion of Trade Secret for the full year negatively impacted segment margin by 0.9 percentage points. In addition fiscal 2017 segment margin was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory derivatives, higher store payroll costs and expense deleverage on the weak same store sales growth. Segment profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 7.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the strong same stores sales increase, which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin. The investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business, investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans, our new store openings in Austria and the Netherlands and the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia. We expect to add approximately 49 stores to TJX International in fiscal 2018, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 6%. We plan to rebrand the Trade Secret stores to T.K. Maxx stores during fiscal 2018. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 General corporate expense $ 408.2 $ 395.6 $ 324.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. Virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general 32 and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 is driven by continued investments in corporate systems and technology along with increases in compensation, benefits and professional services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower contributions to the TJX charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016. Increased contributions to the TJX charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to our above-plan performance and costs related to the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia accounted for approximately $61 million of the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,602 million in fiscal 2017, $2,937 million in fiscal 2016 and $3,008 million in fiscal 2015. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 increased by $665 million compared to fiscal 2016. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items and the early extinguishment of debt, increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 by $86 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in an increase of cash of $60 million in fiscal 2017, compared to a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, positively impacting year-over-year cash flows by $350 million. The positive cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable in 2017 was due to lower inventory levels at fiscal 2017 year end and increased payments in fiscal 2016 due to merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $536 million in fiscal 2017 versus a favorable impact of $353 million in fiscal 2016. This favorable impact of $183 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by increased liabilities for deferred compensation, gift cards and deferred revenue, sales taxes and income taxes payable. Fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by $71 million compared to fiscal 2015. Net income adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation and deferred income tax provision, provided cash of $2,926 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2,906 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $20 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, negatively impacting year-over-year cash flows by $243 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of $166 million in fiscal 2015. This favorable impact of $187 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional $100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2016. Lastly, fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions January 28,2017 January 30,2016 January 31,2015 New stores $ 191.2 $ 199.1 $ 201.5 Store renovations and improvements 274.8 299.7 266.8 Office and distribution centers 558.7 390.6 443.2 Capital expenditures $ 1,024.7 $ 889.4 $ 911.5 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 will be approximately $1.2 billion, including approximately $600 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and 33 information systems) to support growth, approximately $350 million for store renovations and approximately $250 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. In fiscal 2017, we purchased $717 million of investments, compared to $798 million in fiscal 2016. Additionally, $529 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2017 compared to $681 million in the prior year. This activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. Finally, fiscal 2016 investing activities include the initial payment of $57 million for the acquisition of Trade Secret. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,562 million in fiscal 2017, $2,176 million in fiscal 2016 and $1,560 million in fiscal 2015. During the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of $992.5 million from the issuance of $1 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes prior to their scheduled maturity. The redemption of the notes, including the prepayment penalty, resulted in cash outflows of $426 million. The remainder of the proceeds from the notes offering were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. TJX repurchased and retired 22.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2017, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.7 billion to repurchase 22.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017, $1.8 billion to repurchase 26.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016 and $1.7 billion to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015. See Note E to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In February 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $1.04 per share in fiscal 2017, $0.84 per share in fiscal 2016 and $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $651 million in fiscal 2017, $544 million in fiscal 2016 and $466 million in fiscal 2015. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $164 million in fiscal 2017, $132 million in fiscal 2016 and $143 million in fiscal 2015. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2018 of $0.3125 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.25 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent a 20% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017. We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 28, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.3 billion, of which $341.7 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. We have provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India and Hong Kong. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we would not expect to incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. For all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. We have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. One of our credit facilities was amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and is more fully described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements. 34 Contractual obligations: As of January 28, 2017, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 2,808,964 $ 64,774 $ 129,173 $ 870,380 $ 1,744,637 Operating lease commitments(2) 8,521,086 1,455,642 2,629,436 1,997,670 2,438,338 Purchase obligations(3) 3,440,995 3,307,565 86,016 45,865 1,549 Total obligations $ 14,771,045 $ 4,827,981 $ 2,884,625 $ 2,913,915 $ 4,184,524 (1) Includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligations. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2017. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $471.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, and $36.7 million for uncertain tax positions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except STP and Trade Secret. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and revenue growth for the related business unit. The fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount with the exception of 35 Sierra Trading Post (STP). Currently the fair value of STP exceeds the carrying value by approximately 10%. Our valuation for STP assumes a WACC of 10.1% for similar type entities and a perpetuity growth rate of 2%. An increase of 50 basis points in the WACC reduces the valuation by approximately $30 million and a decrease in the perpetuity growth rate of 50 basis points reduces the fair value by approximately $10 to $15 million. The valuation also assumes 15 to 20 new stores are opened annually over the next 10 years. We continue to transition STP from a promotional model to the off-price model and expand its store base. Although we are optimistic about the future of STP, since its acquisition these changes have resulted in operating results that have not met our short term expectations. The operating results of STP are not material to TJX’s consolidated results, if however their operating results continue to fall short of our projections it is possible we could be faced with an impairment of some or all of the $97 million of goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. These assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2017 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $10 million. Similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost. A change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2017 pension cost by approximately $3 million. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2017, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $50 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. A 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 6% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 6%. Casualty insurance: Our casualty insurance program is a self-insured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2017 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2017 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $30.8 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 28, 2017. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely 36 than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting standards, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 37 but could have reduced our pre-tax income for the fiscal year by approximately $65 million and $69 million, respectively. EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISK The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note J to the consolidated financial statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:18.413623
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2018,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations TJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to the Company’s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K. The Company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TJX undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. The discussion that follows relates to our 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) and our 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) and January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016). OVERVIEW We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 4,000 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx 26 (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). We also operate Sierra Trading Post (“STP”), an off-price Internet retailer that operates sierratradingpost.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment. During the fourth quarter, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 referred to as “tax reform” or the “2017 Tax Act” was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act, along with the related reinvestments made by the Company, had a significant impact on our fiscal 2018 results (see “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” below). Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2018 include the following: — Net sales increased to $35.9 billion for fiscal 2018, up 8% over the same period last year. The 53rd week in fiscal 2018 increased net sales by 2%. At February 3, 2018, the number of stores in operation increased 7% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2017. — Comp sales on a 52-week basis increased 2% in fiscal 2018 over an increase of 5% in fiscal 2017 and an increase of 5% in fiscal 2016. The fiscal 2018 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic at each of our four segments. — Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 were $4.04 compared to $3.46 per share in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 earnings per share includes a $0.17 net benefit from tax reform along with the related investments made by the Company, an $0.11 benefit from the 53rd week in the Company’s fiscal 2018 calendar partially offset by a $0.10 impairment charge related to STP. Fiscal 2017 earnings per share includes a $0.07 reduction due to a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a pension settlement charge during the third quarter. — Our fiscal 2018 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 10.8%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease compared to 11.2% in fiscal 2017. The impairment charge relating to STP and the cost of incremental investments we made in connection with the 2017 Tax Act collectively reduced pre-tax margin by 0.6 percentage points while the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar lifted pretax margin by approximately 0.1 percentage point. Fiscal 2017 pre-tax margin was reduced by 0.3 percentage points due to the two third quarter charges referred to above. — Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2018 was 71.1%, a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to 71.0% in fiscal 2017. This increase was driven by higher supply chain costs partially offset by the favorable impact of mark-to-market of inventory derivatives and a benefit from the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar. Merchandise margins were flat compared to fiscal 2017. — Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2018 was 17.8%, a 0.4 percentage point increase from 17.4% in fiscal 2017. The incremental investments described below related to the 2017 Tax Act increased the fiscal 2018 expense ratio by 0.3 percentage points. The remaining increase is primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to wage increases. — Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, increased 6% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior year. — During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 22.3 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion, on a “trade date basis”. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. With $1.1 billion remaining under previously announced stock repurchase programs, our Board of Directors approved our 19th stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion. 27 The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted into law which, among other things, includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign undistributed earnings and a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. The change in the U.S. income tax rate also requires us to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although we are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on TJX, the Company has estimated the impact of the 2017 Tax Act which resulted in a reduction of the full year tax provision. The Company has reinvested a portion of these tax benefits by approving a discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan Associates globally, providing an incremental contribution to the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible Associates in the U.S. and internationally, as well as making contributions to the Company’s charitable foundations, collectively referred to as “incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act.” The tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 Tax Act, offset by the after-tax impact of incremental investments we made related to the 2017 Tax Act, resulted in a net benefit to net income of $0.17 per share for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 totaled $35.9 billion, an 8% increase over $33.2 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 2% increase from comp sales, and a 2% increase from the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar. Foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2018. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses amounted to approximately 2% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2018 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled $33.2 billion, a 7% increase over $30.9 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase reflected a 5% increase from comp sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable Store Sales: We define comparable store sales (“comp sales”), formerly referred to as same-store sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculate comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation. Sales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consists of: — New stores- stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria — Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time — Sales from our e-commerce businesses, meaning Sierra Trading Post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com We determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, 37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes, mostly in Puerto Rico, and were excluded from comp sales. These stores will be included in the comp sales measures once they again meet the comp sales criteria. Comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. Comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies. 28 Comp sales increases across all of our four segments for fiscal 2018 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had an increase in the number of units sold, which was more than offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2018, home fashions and apparel both grew, with home fashions performing better than apparel. Geographically, in the U.S., the Southeast and the Southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increase, and the Northeast was below the consolidated average. In Canada, comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average and TJX International was at the consolidated average. Comp sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had an increase in units sold, which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2017, home fashions performed better than apparel, but both recorded comp sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast and the Great Lakes regions reporting the highest comp sales growth. In Canada, comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was below the consolidated average. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.1 71.0 71.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 17.8 17.4 16.8 Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets 0.3 — — Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 0.2 — Pension settlement charge — 0.1 — Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes* 10.8 % 11.2 % 11.8 % Diluted earnings per share $ 4.04 $ 3.46 $ 3.33 * Figures may not foot due to rounding. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows: — Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period. — Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency.” This does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a 29 currency other than an operating division’s local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange.” Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 71.0% in fiscal 2017 and 71.2% in fiscal 2016. The increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2018 was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest and open new distribution centers. This was offset by the favorable impact of mark-to-market of inventory derivatives that benefitted expense ratio by approximately 0.1 percentage point as well as an estimated 0.1 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in the Company’s fiscal 2018 calendar. Merchandise margin was flat to fiscal 2017. The improvement in the fiscal 2017 expense ratio was driven by an increase in our merchandise margin along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% comp sales increase. Together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year. Although not as significant as in fiscal 2016, the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segments’ local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. These improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the mark-to-market of inventory derivatives. SG&A: SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.8% in fiscal 2018, 17.4% in fiscal 2017 and 16.8% in fiscal 2016. The fiscal 2018 expense ratio increased by 0.3 percentage points due to the incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act. The remaining increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher employee payroll costs due to wage increases. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to wage increases and investments to support our growth and supply chain costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the TJX charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, related to STP: Our fiscal 2018 results included a $99.3 million impairment charge, primarily related to goodwill, as the estimated fair value of STP fell below the carrying value due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates. The impairment charge is included in the Marmaxx segment. As we continue transitioning this business to an off-price model, we saw improvement in the top line during the second half of fiscal 2018. We remain confident in the potential of STP and believe we are positioned for successful growth going forward. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: During the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes on October 12, 2016, prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019 and we recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million. Pension settlement charge: During the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we offered eligible former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. As a result, TJX’s qualified pension plan paid $103.2 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer. This transaction had no cash impact on TJX, but did result in a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $31.2 million. Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in thousands February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 Interest expense $ 69,237 $ 69,219 $ 68,253 Capitalized interest (4,942 ) (7,548 ) (7,984 ) Interest (income) (32,707 ) (18,137 ) (13,869 ) Interest expense, net $ 31,588 $ 43,534 $ 46,400 30 The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was driven by additional interest income, primarily due to an increase in invested balances and higher return rates. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 32.4% in fiscal 2018, 38.3% in fiscal 2017 and 37.7% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the favorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09- Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and the jurisdictional mix of income. The increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. In addition, the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new Tangible Property Regulations. The 2017 Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code which impacted fiscal 2018 including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and requiring a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The provisional tax benefit of the 2017 Tax Act is based on currently available information and interpretations, which are continuing to evolve. We will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the 2017 Tax Act as supplemental legislation, regulatory guidance, or evolving technical interpretations become available. The final impacts may differ from the recorded amounts as of February 3, 2018, and we will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. We expect to complete our analysis no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $2.3 billion in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $4.04 in fiscal 2018, $3.46 in fiscal 2017 and $3.33 in fiscal 2016. The tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 Tax Act, offset by the after-tax impact of the incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act, resulted in a net benefit to diluted earnings per share of $0.17 per share. The impairment charge related to STP reduced fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share by $0.10 per share while the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar provided a benefit of approximately $0.11 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.02 positive impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017, and a $0.07 negative impact in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we incurred charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement, collectively reducing fiscal 2017 net income by $50 million, or $0.07 per share. Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in each fiscal year presented. We repurchased 22.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, and 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016. Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and the HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods and Homesense) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. We also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer that operates sierratradingpost.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of STP have been included in our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, the pension settlement charge and interest expense, net. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. 31 Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 Net sales $ 22,249.1 $ 21,246.0 $ 19,948.2 Segment profit $ 2,949.4 $ 2,995.0 $ 2,858.8 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.3 % 14.1 % 14.3 % Increase in comp sales 1 % 5 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Maxx 27,077 26,614 26,158 Marshalls 24,916 24,750 24,308 STP 470 227 159 Total 52,463 51,591 50,625 Net sales for Marmaxx increased 5% in fiscal 2018 on top of a 7% increase in fiscal 2017. The increase reflects a 2% increase from new store sales, a 2% increase from the 53rd week and a 1% increase from comp sales. The comp sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2018 is on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. Comp sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2018 was due to a 3% increase in customer traffic on top of a 4% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2017, which was offset by a decrease in the average basket. Geographically, comp sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast and Southwest regions particularly strong and the Northeast was below the segment average. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2018, with apparel posting flat comp sales on top of strong comp sales in fiscal 2017. E-commerce sales represented approximately 2% of Marmaxx’s net sales. Segment margin decreased to 13.3% in fiscal 2018 compared to 14.1% in fiscal 2017. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2018 reflect a 0.4 percentage point negative impact from the STP impairment charge. In addition, higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases, and higher distribution costs, primarily due to processing more units, collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.5 percentage points. The fiscal 2018 segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 1% comp sales but was favorably impacted by approximately 0.1 percentage point due to the 53rd week. Merchandise margin was flat for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Tjmaxx.com and STP, excluding the impairment charge, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. Segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 14.1% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2016. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage, on comp sales growth, of approximately 0.7 percentage points. However, these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level, higher distribution costs, as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs. Tjmaxx.com and STP did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. In fiscal 2019, we expect to open approximately 65 Marmaxx stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%. 32 HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 Net sales $ 5,116.3 $ 4,404.6 $ 3,915.2 Segment profit $ 674.5 $ 613.8 $ 549.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.2 % 13.9 % 14.0 % Increase in comp sales 4 % 6 % 8 % Stores in operation at end of period HomeGoods 667 579 526 Homesense 4 — — Total 671 579 526 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) HomeGoods 12,448 11,119 10,234 Homesense 81 — — Total 12,529 11,119 10,234 HomeGoods’ net sales increased 16% in fiscal 2018, on top of a 12% increase in fiscal 2017. The increase in fiscal 2018 reflected a 10% increase from new store sales, a 4% increase from comp sales and a 2% increase due to the 53rd week. The sales increase of 12% in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6% increase from new store sales and a 6% increase from comp sales. Comp sales growth at HomeGoods for fiscal 2018 was due to a 4% increase in customer traffic on top of a 5% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2017. Comp sales growth in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was also due to an increase in units sold, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Segment profit margin decreased to 13.2% for fiscal 2018 compared to 13.9% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2018 includes a decline in merchandise margin of 0.5 percentage points, primarily as a result of increased freight costs. In addition, higher distribution center costs primarily due to opening a new distribution center, higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases, as well as costs in connection with opening more stores as compared to fiscal 2017, including our first Homesense stores, collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.8 percentage points. These costs were partially offset by expense leverage on comp sales growth as well as the benefit of the 53rd week which lifted segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 13.9% compared to 14.0% for fiscal 2016. Segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage, primarily occupancy costs, on strong comp sales growth. These increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases, an increase in distribution costs, which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017, and an increase in credit card chargeback costs. In fiscal 2019, we plan an increase of approximately 85 HomeGoods stores and 15 Homesense stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 18%. 33 Foreign Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 Net sales $ 3,642.3 $ 3,171.1 $ 2,854.6 Segment profit $ 530.1 $ 413.4 $ 375.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.6 % 13.0 % 13.1 % Increase in comp sales 5 % 8 % 12 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 264 255 245 HomeSense 117 106 101 Marshalls 73 57 41 Total 454 418 387 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,780 5,629 5,470 HomeSense 2,179 1,984 1,900 Marshalls 1,621 1,307 975 Total 9,580 8,920 8,345 Net sales for TJX Canada increased 15% in fiscal 2018, on top of an 11% increase in fiscal 2017. The increase in sales for fiscal 2018 reflected comp sales growth of 5%, a 5% increase from new stores, 3% from the positive impact of foreign currency translation and a 2% impact of the 53rd week. The increase in sales for fiscal 2017 reflected comp sales growth of 8% and a 5% increase from new stores offset by 2% from the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The comp sales increases in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin increased 1.6 percentage points to 14.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to 13.0% in fiscal 2017. The increase in segment margin was primarily due to the combination of an increase in merchandise margin of 0.6 percentage points, which benefitted from the year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar, and expense leverage on the strong comp sales. The increase in the segment margin also included a favorable impact of 0.3 percentage points due to foreign currency, primarily the mark-to-market impact of the inventory derivatives. The fiscal 2018 segment margin also benefitted from the 53rd week, which lifted the segment margin by approximately 0.1 percentage point. Segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage point to 13.0% in fiscal 2017. The decline in segment margin was driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher supply chain and distribution center costs, which included the opening of a new distribution center. The decline in merchandise margin was primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased TJX Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. These declines in segment margin were largely offset by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on the comp sales growth, as well as the benefit of transactional foreign currency activity resulting in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 as compared to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016. These foreign currency gains and losses result from the timing and settlement of payables denominated in currencies other than the Canadian Dollar. In fiscal 2019, we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 6%. 34 TJX International Fiscal Year Ended U.S. Dollars in millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 Net sales $ 4,856.9 $ 4,362.0 $ 4,226.9 Segment profit $ 249.2 $ 235.5 $ 316.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 5.1 % 5.4 % 7.5 % Increase in comp sales 2 % 2 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Maxx Australia 714 667 667 Total 12,976 12,168 11,276 Net sales for TJX International increased 11% in fiscal 2018 on top of a 3% increase in fiscal 2017. The increase in sales for fiscal 2018 reflected a 7% increase from new stores, comp sales growth of 2%, and a 2% benefit from the 53rd week. Foreign currency translation had a neutral impact on fiscal 2018 sales growth. The increase in comp sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. E-commerce sales represent less than 3% of TJX International’s net sales. The increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 12% increase from new store sales (which includes a full fiscal year of T.K. Maxx in Australia) and a 2% increase from comp sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 11%. The increase in comp sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin decreased to 5.1% for fiscal 2018 compared to 5.4% for fiscal 2017. The decline in segment margin was driven by higher supply chain costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center and higher store payroll, which collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.7 percentage points. Segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 2% comp sales growth. These declines in segment margin were partially offset by a favorable impact of 0.4 percentage points due to foreign currency, primarily the mark-to-market impact of the inventory derivatives as well as the benefit of the 53rd week, which lifted the segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Segment profit margin decreased 2.1% percentage points to 5.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The inclusion of T.K. Maxx in Australia for the full year negatively impacted segment margin by 0.9 percentage points. In addition, fiscal 2017 segment margin was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory derivatives, higher store payroll costs and expense deleverage on the lower comp sales growth. We expect to add approximately 35 stores to TJX International in fiscal 2019, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 5%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended Dollars in millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 General corporate expense $ 515.0 $ 408.2 $ 395.6 35 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act. These investments include a discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan associates, additional retirement plan contributions and contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations, which totaled $100 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs as well as increases in compensation, benefits and professional services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower contributions to the TJX charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 3, 2018, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note J – Long Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. As of February 3, 2018, TJX held $2.8 billion in cash and $0.5 billion in short-term investments. Approximately $1.8 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $398.6 million held in countries where we provisionally intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. TJX has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through February 3, 2018. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid. We expect to repatriate more than $1 billion in cash from our subsidiary in Canada during fiscal 2019. Additionally, as part of the 2017 Tax Act we recorded a transition tax related to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $193 million which is payable over 8 years. Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion in fiscal 2018, $3.6 billion in fiscal 2017 and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2016. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 decreased by $0.6 billion compared to fiscal 2017. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 by $0.3 billion. This increase in cash flows was more than offset by a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to merchandise inventories, net of related accounts payable, a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities. Merchandise inventories, net of related accounts payable increased in fiscal 2018 due in part to the lower inventory levels we carried at fiscal 2017 year end. The increase in accounts receivable was driven by credit card receivables. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the prefunding of certain service contracts as well as the timing of rent payments which was impacted by the change in our fiscal year end dates. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven by a reduction in sales taxes and income taxes payable, primarily due to timing of payments and benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, as well as a contribution of $100 million to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2018, as compared to $50 million last year. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 increased by $0.7 billion compared to fiscal 2016. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items and the early extinguishment of debt, increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 by $0.1 billion. The remaining increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to a $0.3 billion increase in cash flows related to merchandise inventory, net of related accounts payable and a 36 $0.2 billion increase in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities. The positive cash flow impact from the change in inventory, net of related accounts payable in 2017 was due to lower inventory levels at fiscal 2017 year end and increased payments in fiscal 2016 due to merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. The positive impact from accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven primarily by increased liabilities for deferred compensation, gift cards and deferred revenue, sales taxes and income taxes payable. Investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended In millions February 3,2018 January 28,2017 January 30,2016 New stores $ 226.0 $ 191.2 $ 199.1 Store renovations and improvements 335.2 274.8 299.7 Office and distribution centers 496.4 558.7 390.6 Capital expenditures $ 1,057.6 $ 1,024.7 $ 889.4 We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 will be approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $800 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, approximately $400 million for store renovations and approximately $200 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. In fiscal 2018, we purchased $0.9 billion of investments, compared to $0.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Additionally, $0.9 billion of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2018 compared to $0.5 billion in the prior year. This activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. Financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2018, $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017 and $2.2 billion in fiscal 2016. These cash outflows were primarily driven by debt transactions, equity repurchases and dividend payments. Debt During the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of $992.5 million from the issuance of $1 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes prior to their scheduled maturity. The redemption of the notes, including the prepayment penalty, resulted in cash outflows of $426 million. The remainder of the proceeds from the notes offering were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. For further information regarding debt, see Note J – Long Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity TJX repurchased and retired 22.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2018, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.6 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2018, $1.7 billion to repurchase 22.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017 and $1.8 billion to repurchase 26.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D – Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2019. We 37 determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. Dividends We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $1.25 per share in fiscal 2018, $1.04 per share in fiscal 2017 and $0.84 per share in fiscal 2016. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $764 million in fiscal 2018, $651 million in fiscal 2017 and $544 million in fiscal 2016. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $134 million in fiscal 2018, $164 million in fiscal 2017 and $132 million in fiscal 2016. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2019 of $0.39 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.56 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent a 25% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2018. Contractual obligations: As of February 3, 2018, we had known contractual obligations under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments), other long-term obligations, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt and other long-term obligations (1) $ 2,960,726 $ 83,782 $ 166,810 $ 886,782 $ 1,823,352 Operating lease commitments (2) 9,494,751 1,600,536 2,924,504 2,233,360 2,736,351 Purchase obligations (3) 3,689,892 3,474,158 153,249 62,485 — Total obligations $ 16,145,369 $ 5,158,476 $ 3,244,563 $ 3,182,627 $ 4,559,703 (1) Includes estimated interest costs, financing lease obligations and other long-term liabilities. (2) Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2018. (3) Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $442.6 million for employee compensation and benefits, and $44.8 million for uncertain tax positions. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia and STP. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and 38 actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory. Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: We test our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may be impaired. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets or tradenames has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. If we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and revenue growth for the related business unit. The fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount with the exception of STP. As a result of a reduction in the projected revenue growth rates of STP the estimated fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and therefore we have recorded an impairment charge of $97.3 million for the goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition. We continue to transition STP from a promotional model to the off-price model and expand its store base. Although we are optimistic about the future of STP, since its acquisition, operating results have not met our short term expectations. The operating results of STP are not material to TJX’s consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. These assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2018 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $7 million. Similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost. A change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2018 pension cost by approximately $3 million. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, any required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2018, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $100 million. Share-based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. A 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 4% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 5%. Casualty insurance: Our casualty insurance program is a self-insured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our 39 estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2018 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2018 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $39.6 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of February 3, 2018. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made, such as the recently enacted tax reform. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how corporations are taxed, requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. 40 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of accounting pronouncements, see Note A- Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E- Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income by approximately $78 million and $65 million, in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISK The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I- Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:23.126324
109198,TJX,TJX COMPANIES INC /DE/,2019,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to the Company’s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K. The Company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TJX undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019), our 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018), and our 52-week fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017).23OVERVIEWWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 4,300 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and T.K. Maxx in Australia). We also operate Sierra, formerly known as Sierra Trading Post that operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are reported in our Marmaxx segment.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 referred to as “tax reform” or the “2017 Tax Act” was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act, along with the related reinvestments made by the Company, had a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 results (see “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” below).During fiscal 2019, we completed a two-for-one stock split of our common stock; as such, all share and related data, as well as basic and diluted earnings per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the split.Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2019 include the following:–Net sales increased to $39 billion for fiscal 2019, up 9% over fiscal 2018. At February 2, 2019, the number of stores in operation increased 6% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2018.–Comp sales increased 6% in fiscal 2019 over an increase of 2% in fiscal 2018 and an increase of 5% in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2019 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic at each of our four segments.–Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 were $2.43 compared to $2.02 per share in fiscal 2018. –Our fiscal 2019 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 10.7%, a 0.1 percentage point decrease compared to 10.8% in fiscal 2018.–Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2019 was 71.4% a 0.3 percentage point increase compared to 71.1% in fiscal 2018. –Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2019 was 17.8%, which was flat to fiscal 2018. –Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, increased 1% on a reported basis and increased 3% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year.–During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 51.8 million shares of our common stock for $2.5 billion, on a “trade date basis”. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of our stock repurchase programs. In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved a repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX common stock.The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted into law which included a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018 and had a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 operating results. The tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a net benefit to net income of $0.34 per share for fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, the Company reinvested a portion of the tax benefits through a discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan Associates globally and an incremental contribution to the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible Associates in the U.S. and internationally, as well as making contributions to the Company’s charitable foundations, collectively referred to as “incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act.” The tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 Tax Act, offset by the after-tax impact of incremental investments we made related to the 2017 Tax Act, resulted in a net benefit to net income of $0.09 per share for fiscal 2018.24Impact of Brexit The U.K’s decision to leave the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”, remains unsettled. Should the U.K. exit the EU, there are several possible outcomes each of which creates risks for TJX, especially in our European operations. Our TJX Europe management team has evaluated a range of possible outcomes, sought to identify areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them. Our current European operations benefit from the free movement of goods and labor between the U.K. and EU. As a result, we believe Brexit could have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise between the U.K. and the EU. Brexit could also have a negative impact on our talent in the region, both by impacting current Associates, who are either EU citizens working in the U.K. or U.K. citizens working in the EU, and potentially impacting recruitment and retention for our European operations in the future.If the U.K. does exit the EU, this would require additional regulatory and compliance requirements for merchandise that flows between the U.K. and the EU. We have developed a plan to realign our European division’s supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the U.K. and the EU and have established resources and systems to support this plan. In addition, we continue to communicate with our Associates about Brexit including by providing relevant information about additional procedures that may be required post-Brexit.We believe these steps will help us mitigate the operational risks that we expect could result from Brexit. If, however, Brexit happens without a comprehensive withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the EU and therefore, without a longer transitional period, our European operations could be significantly impacted, particularly in the short term. We believe that over time we would implement appropriate strategies to address that outcome.Net SalesConsolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 totaled $39 billion, a 9% increase over $35.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase reflected a 6% increase from comp stores and a 3% increase from non-comp sales. Foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2019. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2019 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 totaled $35.9 billion, an 8% increase over $33.2 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase reflected a 4% increase from non-comp sales, a 2% increase from comp sales, and a 2% increase from the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar. Foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2018.Revenues by GeographyThe percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last three fiscal years are as follows: Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 United States Northeast23% 24% 24% Midwest13 12 12 South (including Puerto Rico)25 25 25 West15 15 16 Subtotal76 76 77 Canada10 10 10 Europe13 13 13 Australia1 1 * Total100% 100% 100% *Revenue from Australia was less than one percent during fiscal 2017.Comparable Store SalesWe define comparable store sales (“comp sales”) to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculate comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation.25Sales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consists of–New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales–Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time–Sales from our e-commerce businesses, meaning Sierra (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.comWe determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, 37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes, mostly in Puerto Rico, and were excluded from comp sales. These stores will be included in the comp sales measures once they again meet the comp sales criteria.Comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.Comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies.Comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2019 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. In fiscal 2019, home fashions and apparel both grew, with apparel outperforming home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., the Southeast, Great Lakes and the Southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases, and the Mid Atlantic was below the consolidated average. Comp sales increases for TJX Canada and TJX International were below the consolidated average.Comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2018 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had an increase in the number of units sold, which was more than offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2018, home fashions and apparel both grew, with home fashions performing better than apparel. Geographically, in the U.S., the Southeast and the Southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases, and the Northeast was below the consolidated average. In Canada, comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average and TJX International was at the consolidated average.The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.

Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows:–Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.26–Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency.” This does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange.”Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy CostsCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.4% in fiscal 2019 compared to 71.1% in fiscal 2018 and 71.0% in fiscal 2017. The increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2019 was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest in existing and open new distribution centers as well as the absence of the benefit of the 53rd week reflected in last year's expense ratio. Merchandise margin was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2018 despite significantly higher freight costs.The increase in the fiscal 2018 expense ratio was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest and open new distribution centers. This was offset by the favorable impact of mark-to-market of inventory derivatives that benefited the expense ratio by approximately 0.1 percentage point as well as an estimated 0.1 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in the Company’s fiscal 2018 calendar. Fiscal 2018 merchandise margin was essentially flat to fiscal 2017.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.8% in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, and 17.4% in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2019 expense ratio reflects an increase in incentive compensation accruals due to a stronger than expected operating performance as well as store wage increases, partially offset by leverage on strong comp sales. The fiscal 2018 expense ratio reflects the impact of the incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act and higher employee payroll costs due to wage increases.Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets, Related to SierraDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $99.3 million impairment charge, primarily related to goodwill, as the estimated fair value of Sierra fell below the carrying value due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates. The impairment charge is included in the Marmaxx segment. Loss on Early Extinguishment of DebtDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes on October 12, 2016, prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019 and we recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million.Pension Settlement ChargeDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we annuitized and transferred current pension obligations for certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries under the qualified pension plan through the purchase of a group annuity contract with an insurance company. We transferred $207.4 million of pension plan assets to the insurance company, thereby reducing our pension benefit obligations. The transaction had no cash impact to TJX but did result in a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $36.1 million.During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we offered eligible former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. As a result, TJX’s qualified pension plan paid $103.2 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer. This transaction had no cash impact to TJX, but did result in a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $31.2 million.27Interest Expense, netThe components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year EndedIn thousandsFebruary 2, 2019February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 (53 weeks) Interest expense$69,102$69,237$69,219Capitalized interest(4,263)(4,942)(7,548)Interest (income)(55,979)(32,707)(18,137)Interest expense, net$8,860$31,588$43,534The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was driven by additional interest income, primarily due to higher return rates.Provision for Income TaxesOur effective annual income tax rate was 26.7% in fiscal 2019, 32.4% in fiscal 2018 and 38.3% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in the fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the favorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09- Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and the jurisdictional mix of income. The 2017 Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code which impacted fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which allows a measurement period, not to exceed one year, to finalize the accounting for the income tax impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. We completed our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and determined there was no material adjustment to the income tax expense.Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareNet income was $3.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018 and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $2.43 in fiscal 2019, $2.02 in fiscal 2018 and $1.73 in fiscal 2017. Year over year results are impacted by numerous items that impact comparability as summarized below.

Our Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and the HomeGoods segment (HomeGoods and Homesense) both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, Homesense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and T.K. Maxx in Australia. We also operate Sierra, formerly Sierra Trading Post that operates sierra.com and retail stores in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in our Marmaxx segment.We evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, the pension settlement charge and interest expense, net. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.29U.S. SEGMENTSMarmaxx Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsFebruary 2, 2019February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 (53 weeks) Net sales$24,058.0$22,249.1$21,246.0Segment profit$3,253.9$2,949.4$2,995.0Segment profit as a percentage of net sales13.5%13.3%14.1%Increase in comp sales7%1%5%Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

The fiscal 2019 increase reflects a 7% increase from comp sales and a 1% increase from non-comp sales. The sales increase of 5% in fiscal 2018 reflects a 2% increase from non-comp sales, a 2% increase from the 53rd week and a 1% increase from comp sales. Comp sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a 5% increase in customer traffic on top of a 3% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2018. Geographically, comp sales were strong throughout most of the country as all regions posted a 5% comp or greater. Apparel outperformed home fashions in fiscal 2019 with both categories posting solid comp sales growth. Sales of our U.S. e-commerce businesses represented approximately 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales.Segment margin increased to 13.5% in fiscal 2019 compared to 13.3% in fiscal 2018. This comparison is impacted by items impacting the fiscal 2018 segment margin, primarily the Sierra impairment charge which reduced last year’s segment margin by 0.4 percentage points. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2019 reflect an improvement due to expense leverage on the strong comp sales which was more than offset by higher incentive compensation accruals due to the stronger than expected operating performance and an increase in distribution costs and store wages. Collectively these items reduced the fiscal 2019 segment margin by 0.7 percentage points. Merchandise margin was essentially flat for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 despite a significant increase in freight costs. Our U.S. e-commerce businesses, excluding the fiscal 2018 impairment charge, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.Segment margin in fiscal 2018 was 13.3% compared to 14.1% in fiscal 2017. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2018 reflect a 0.4 percentage point negative impact from the Sierra impairment charge. In addition, higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases, and higher distribution costs, primarily due to processing more units, collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.5 percentage points. The fiscal 2018 segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 1% comp sales but was favorably impacted by approximately 0.1 percentage point due to the 53rd week. Merchandise margin was flat for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Our U.S. e-commerce businesses, excluding the impairment charge, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.In fiscal 2020, we expect to open approximately 60 Marmaxx stores and 10 Sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.30HomeGoods Fiscal Year EndedIn millionsFebruary 2, 2019February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 (53 weeks) Net sales$5,787.4$5,116.3$4,404.6Segment profit$671.9$674.5$613.8Segment profit as a percentage of net sales11.6%13.2%13.9%Increase in comp sales4%4%6%Stores in operation at end of period HomeGoods749667579Homesense164—Total765671579Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) HomeGoods13,77512,44811,119Homesense34381—Total14,11812,52911,119HomeGoods’ net sales increased 13% in fiscal 2019, on top of a 16% increase in fiscal 2018.

The sales increase of 16% in fiscal 2018 reflects a 10% increase from non-comp sales, a 4% increase from comp sales and a 2% increase due to the 53rd week. Comp sales growth at HomeGoods for fiscal 2019 was due to a 5% increase in customer traffic on top of a 4% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2018.Segment profit margin decreased to 11.6% for fiscal 2019 compared to 13.2% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2019 includes a decline in merchandise margin due to increased freight costs. In addition, higher distribution center costs and higher store wage costs as well as costs in connection with investing in more stores, collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 1.1 percentage points. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2018 was 13.2% compared to 13.9% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2018 includes a decline in merchandise margin of 0.5 percentage points, primarily as a result of increased freight costs. In addition, higher distribution center costs primarily due to opening a new distribution center, higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases, as well as costs in connection with opening more stores as compared to fiscal 2017, including our first Homesense stores, collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.8 percentage points. These costs were partially offset by expense leverage on comp sales growth as well as the benefit of the 53rd week which lifted segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points.In fiscal 2020, we plan an increase of approximately 65 HomeGoods stores and 15 Homesense stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11%.31FOREIGN SEGMENTSTJX Canada Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 2, 2019February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 (53 weeks) Net sales$3,869.8$3,642.3$3,171.1Segment profit$551.6$530.1$413.4Segment profit as a percentage of net sales14.3%14.6%13.0%Increase in comp sales4%5%8%Stores in operation at end of period Winners271264255HomeSense125117106Marshalls887357Total484454418Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners5,8625,7805,629HomeSense2,3232,1791,984Marshalls1,8851,6211,307Total10,0709,5808,920Net sales for TJX Canada increased 6% in fiscal 2019, on top of a 15% increase in fiscal 2018.

The increase in sales for fiscal 2018 reflects comp sales growth of 5%, a 5% increase from non-comp stores, a 3% positive impact of foreign currency translation and a 2% impact of the 53rd week. The comp sales increase in fiscal 2019 was due to a 5% increase in customer traffic on top of a 5% increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2018.Segment profit margin decreased to 14.3% in fiscal 2019 compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in segment margin was primarily due to the combination of a higher store wage and freight costs, partially offset by expense leverage on the strong comp sales.Segment profit margin increased 1.6 percentage points to 14.6% in fiscal 2018. The increase in segment margin was primarily due to the combination of an increase in merchandise margin of 0.6 percentage points, which benefited from the year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar, and expense leverage on the strong comp sales. The increase in the segment margin also included a favorable impact of 0.3 percentage points due to foreign currency, primarily the mark-to-market impact of the inventory derivatives. The fiscal 2018 segment margin also benefited from the 53rd week, which lifted the segment margin by approximately 0.1 percentage point.In fiscal 2020, we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 5%.32TJX International Fiscal Year EndedU.S. dollars in millionsFebruary 2, 2019February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 (53 weeks) Net sales$5,257.8$4,856.9$4,362.0Segment profit$285.8$249.2$235.5Segment profit as a percentage of net sales5.4%5.1%5.4%Increase in comp sales3%2%2%Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

The increase in sales for fiscal 2019 reflects a 4% increase from non-comp sales, comp sales growth of 3%, and a 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. The increase in comp sales for fiscal 2019 was driven by a 4% increase in customer traffic. E-commerce sales represent less than 3% of TJX International’s net sales in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2018 reflects a 7% increase from non-comp sales, comp sales growth of 2% and a 2% benefit from the 53rd week. Foreign currency translation had a neutral impact on fiscal 2018 sales growth. The increase in comp sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin increased to 5.4% for fiscal 2019 compared to 5.1% for fiscal 2018. The increase in segment margin was driven by favorable merchandise margins of 0.4 percentage points, primarily due to lower markdowns, along with the favorable reserve adjustment relating to a wage audit and expense leverage on occupancy costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2018 and higher store payroll, which collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points. Segment profit margin decreased 0.3 percentage points to 5.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 5.4% in fiscal 2017.

General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs, global IT restructuring costs, and higher incentive compensation accruals. Collectively these items increased general corporate expense by approximately $100 million. These increases were partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2019 of the Associate related investments of approximately $70 million incurred in fiscal 2018 associated with the 2017 Tax Act. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the incremental investments related to the 2017 Tax Act. These investments include a discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan Associates, additional retirement plan contributions and contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations, which totaled $100 million in fiscal 2018.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 2, 2019, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding.We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in Note J – Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year.As of February 2, 2019, TJX held $3.0 billion in cash. Approximately $1.2 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $420.6 million held in countries where we provisionally intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. TJX has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through February 2, 2019. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019, $3.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $3.6 billion in fiscal 2017. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings.Operating cash flows for fiscal 2019 increased by $1.1 billion compared to fiscal 2018. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 by $0.5 billion. In addition there was a $0.6 billion increase in cash flows related to prepaid expenses and other current assets largely due to the prefunding of certain service contracts in fiscal 2018.Operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 decreased by $0.6 billion compared to fiscal 2017. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 by $0.3 billion. This increase in cash flows was more than offset by a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to merchandise inventories, net of related accounts payable, a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a $0.3 billion decrease in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities. Merchandise inventories, net of related accounts payable increased in fiscal 2018 due in part to the lower inventory levels we carried at fiscal 2017 year end. The increase in accounts receivable was driven by credit card receivables. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the prefunding of certain service contracts as well as the timing of rent payments which was impacted by the timing in our fiscal year end dates. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven by a reduction in sales taxes and income taxes payable, primarily due to timing of payments and benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, as well as a contribution of $100 million to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2018, as compared to $50 million in fiscal 2017.34Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $0.6 billion in fiscal 2019, $1.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2017. The cash outflows were primarily driven by capital expenditures and, in addition, the activity in fiscal 2019 reflects the liquidation of short-term investments by TJX Canada as a result of a repatriation of earnings completed during the second quarter.Net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below.

We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds.In fiscal 2019, we purchased $0.2 billion of investments, compared to $0.9 billion in fiscal 2018. Additionally, $0.6 billion of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2019 compared to $0.9 billion in the prior year. This activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $3.1 billion in fiscal 2019, $2.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017. These cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases partially offset by issuances, dividend payments and debt transactions.EquityTJX repurchased and retired 51.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $2.5 billion during fiscal 2019, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $2.4 billion to repurchase 50.8 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2019, $1.6 billion to repurchase 44.4 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2018 and $1.7 billion to repurchase 44.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017.For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D – Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $1.5 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2020. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change.DividendsWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.78 per share in fiscal 2019, $0.625 per share in fiscal 2018 and $0.52 per share in fiscal 2017. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $923 million in fiscal 2019, $764 million in fiscal 2018 and $651 million in fiscal 2017. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $255 million in fiscal 2019, $134 million in fiscal 2018 and $164 million in fiscal 2017. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2020 of $0.23 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.92 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. This would represent an 18% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2019.35DebtDuring the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of $992.5 million from the issuance of $1 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes prior to their scheduled maturity. The redemption of the notes, including the prepayment penalty, resulted in cash outflows of $426 million.For further information regarding debt, see Note J – Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations As of February 2, 2019, we had known contractual obligations under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments), other long-term obligations, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows:In thousandsPayments Due by PeriodTabular Disclosure of Contractual ObligationsTotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore Than 5 YearsLong-term debt and other long-term obligations (1)$2,537,813$55,625$850,938$563,750$1,067,500Operating lease commitments (2)9,791,9711,676,7003,044,8222,295,6042,774,845Purchase obligations (3)3,843,1843,666,288155,96320,933—Total obligations$16,172,968$5,398,613$4,051,723$2,880,287$3,842,345(1)Includes estimated interest costs.(2)Reflects minimum rent.

Excludes agreements that can be canceled without penalty.We also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $449.1 million for employee compensation and benefits and $235.5 million for uncertain tax positions.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.Inventory ValuationWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except T.K. Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.36Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and TradenamesWe evaluate our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames for indicators of impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets or tradenames has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. If we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and revenue growth for the related business unit. The fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount.Reserves for Uncertain Tax PositionsLike many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made, such as the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how corporations are taxed, requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we continue our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.Loss ContingenciesCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of accounting pronouncements, see Note A- Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.37ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskTJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E- Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income by approximately $84 million and $78 million, in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISKThe assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I- Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.",2023-12-30 18:51:20.233268
