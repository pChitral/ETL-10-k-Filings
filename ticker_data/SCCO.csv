1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""SCC,"" the"" Company,"" ""our,"" and ""we"") on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 ""Business—Cautionary Statement."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world's largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2016, we invested $1,118.5 million in capital programs, along with $40.1 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world's largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2016, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, totaled 71.4 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 32,523 Peruvian operations 24,237 IMMSA 229 Development projects 14,392 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total 71,381 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following: • Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2016, the average LME and COMEX per pound copper prices were $2.21 and $2.20, respectively, about 12.4% lower than in 2015. In 2016, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $1.96 to $2.69. Average zinc and silver 70 Table of Contents prices increased in 2016 by 8.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared to 2015. Molybdenum price decreased by 2.6% in 2016 compared to 2015. • Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 78% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 6% from molybdenum, 5% from silver, 4% from zinc and 7% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials. • Copper: 2017 is starting with the copper market showing the first signs of a structural supply deficit created by the lack of investments in the last few years. For 2017, we expect demand to grow between 2.0% to 2.5%, driven by China's metal consumption recovery, and a strong economy in the United States and Europe, where the auto industry demand is a driver of basic metal consumption . On the supply side, after five years of copper price reductions, we see supply underperforming the market needs. We expect a weak growth, in the range of 0.5% to 1.0% in 2017. This lack of growth results from the above noted decline in investments as well as technical problems, labor unrest, excess government taxation and other difficulties. All of these factors will contribute to the market deficit in 2017, thereby giving good support to current copper prices. Annual copper production in 2016 was 899,955 tons, a new Company record. This increase of 21.1% from the 742,993 tons produced in 2015 results from the higher production from our Buenavista mine expansion. The additional copper units produced have lower cost per pound, improving the overall Company cash cost and competitiveness. • Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 5.5% of our sales in 2016. • Molybdenum: This metal represented 5.0% of Company sales in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the molybdenum price maintained its level when compared to the third quarter of 2016 due to production cuts from major producers. The molybdenum market is still affected by existing excess inventories and weak demand coming from steel special alloys and the oil drilling industry. Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. • Zinc: Zinc has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and the expected mine production shutdowns. In the last 12 months zinc inventories have consistently decreased, improving this market's fundamentals. We are expecting an increasing price scenario for zinc during 2017. Zinc represented 4.4% of our sales in 2016. • Production: For 2017, we expect to maintain our current production level of about 900,000 tons of copper. For 2018, we will initiate production at the new Toquepala concentrator and expect to be able to produce 972,300 tons of copper, continuing our aggressive organic growth program. We also expect to produce 16.6 million ounces of silver, about 2.5% higher than the 2016 production of 16.2 million ounces due to higher Buenavista and IMMSA production. For zinc production, in 2017, we expect to produce 80,800 tons from our mines, up from 2016's production, of 73,984 tons, mainly due to higher production from our Charcas, Santa Barbara and Santa Eulalia mines, which will increase their milling amd forecast higher grades as well in 2017. Additionally, we expect to produce 19,700 tons of molybdenum, lower by 9.4% from last year's production of 21,736 tons. 71 Table of Contents • Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three-years ended December 2016 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 3,815.6 $ 3,631.5 $ 3,555.0 Percentage increase from prior year 5.1 % 2.2 % 3.9 % Operating costs and expenses in 2016 increased $184.1 million, compared to 2015, principally due to higher costs of sales at our Mexican operations resulting from the 18.3% increase in copper sales volume, higher depreciation, amortization and depletion on the new assets added to our operations at Buenavista. This was partially offset by lower environmental remediation and exploration expenses. Operating costs and expenses in 2015 increased $76.5 million, compared to 2014, principally due to higher production, which led to higher costs of sales and due to higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our operations; partially offset by lower environmental remediation and exploration expense. • Capital investments: Capital investments were $1,118.5 million for 2016. This is 2.7% lower than in 2015, and represented 144% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. In addition, the Buenavista expansion program is largely completed. For 2017, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,105.2 million. The year 2017 will be the starting point of a new strategic plan: we will grow copper production capacity to exceed the one million ton milestone by mid-2018, and by 2023 we expect to reach 1.5 million copper tons. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) ""operating cash costs"" as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts): Variance 2016 2015 2014 2016 - 2015 2015 - 2014 Copper price LME 2.21 2.50 3.11 0.29 0.61 Pounds of copper sold 1,923.9 1,625.8 1,448.0 298.1 177.8 Net sales $ 5,379.8 $ 5,045.9 $ 5,787.7 $ 333.9 $ (741.8 ) Operating income $ 1,564.2 $ 1,414.4 $ 2,232.7 $ 149.8 $ (818.3 ) Net income attributable to SCC $ 776.5 $ 736.4 $ 1,333.0 $ 40.1 $ (596.6 ) Earnings per share $ 1.00 $ 0.93 $ 1.61 $ 0.07 $ (0.68 ) Dividends per share $ 0.18 $ 0.34 $ 0.46 $ (0.16 ) $ (0.12 ) Net sales in 2016 were higher than in 2015, mainly as a result of higher sales volume of copper (+18.3%), silver (+18.9%) and zinc (+4.6%), partially offset by lower prices for copper and molybdenum. Net sales decreased from 2014 to 2015, due to lower metal prices for copper, molybdenum and silver, partially offset by an increase in copper and zinc sales volume. 72 Table of Contents The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2016, cost of sales increased by $106.5 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $136.4 million. In 2015, cost of sales increased by $87.1 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $65.7 million. The increase in cost of sales in both periods was due to higher copper sales volume, which increased by 18.3% and 12.3% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, cost of sales only increased by 3.6% and 3.1% in the respective years, as a result of our lower unit costs. This reduction in unit cost is attributable to the lower unitary cost for our new production as well as lower cost for fuel and other production inputs. The increase in depreciation was mainly due to investment and maintenance capital acquisitions at most of our operations. Net income attributable to SCC in 2016 was 5.4% higher mainly due to the above noted factors. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2016: Variance 2016 - 2015 2015 - 2014 (million pounds, except silver—million ounces) 2016 2015 2014 Volume % Volume % Copper 1,984.1 1,638.0 1,491.6 346.1 21.1 % 146.4 9.8 % Molybdenum 47.9 51.5 51.0 (3.6 ) (6.9 )% 0.5 1.0 % Zinc 163.1 136.5 146.9 26.6 19.5 % (10.4 ) (7.1 )% Silver 16.2 13.3 13.0 2.9 21.7 % 0.3 2.3 % The table below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2016: Variance 2016 - 2015 2015 - 2014 Copper (in million pounds): 2016 2015 2014 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 311.8 316.6 309.7 (4.8 ) (1.5 )% 6.9 2.2 % Cuajone 378.0 392.8 393.2 (14.8 ) (3.8 )% (0.4 ) (0.1 )% La Caridad 293.8 288.9 278.4 4.9 1.7 % 10.5 3.8 % Buenavista 986.4 627.4 498.8 359.0 57.2 % 128.6 25.8 % IMMSA 14.1 12.3 11.5 1.8 14.9 % 0.8 7.3 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total mined copper 1,984.1 1,638.0 1,491.6 346.1 21.1 % 146.4 9.8 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2016 compared to 2015: Mined copper in 2016 increased 346.1 million pounds, compared to 2015 production. This increase was due to: • Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to the ramping up of the new concentrator and better concentrate grades and recoveries. • Higher production at the La Caridad mine due to higher concentrate grades, partially offset by • Lower production at the Cuajone and Toquepala mines due to lower ore grades and concentrate recoveries. Molybdenum production decreased 3.6 million pounds in 2016, compared to 2015, principally due to lower production at our Peruvian mines because of lower grades. Silver production increased 2.9 million ounces in 2016 due to higher production at our Buenavista and IMMSA mines. Zinc 73 Table of Contents production increased by 26.6 million pounds in 2016 due to a year of full production without the flooding problems that we encountered in prior years. 2015 compared to 2014: Mined copper in 2015 increased 146.4 million pounds, compared to 2014 production. This increase was due to: • Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to higher throughput at the concentrator and better ore grades, as well as higher production from the SX-EW III plant. • Higher production at the Toquepala mine and La Caridad mine due to better ore grades and recoveries. • Higher production at the IMMSA mines due to higher throughput at the concentrators, slightly reduced by • Lower production at the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades. Molybdenum production increased 0.5 million pounds in 2015, compared to 2014, and silver production increased 0.3 million ounces in 2015. Zinc production decreased by 10.4 million pounds in 2015, continuing the slide seen in the prior year. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"", beginning on page 90. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both without and with the inclusion of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers' participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers' participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced with by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, with by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal 74 Table of Contents business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community's view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs, without by-product revenues allows us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern as copper is our main source of revenues. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper with by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allow us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project's potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2016: Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2016 - 2015 2015 - 2014 2016 2015 2014 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost without by-product revenues $ 2,789.1 $ 2,643.9 $ 2,739.3 $ 145.2 5.5 % $ (95.4 ) (3.5 )% Total by-product revenues (955.6 ) (866.8 ) (1,186.4 ) (88.8 ) 10.2 % 319.6 (26.9 )% Total operating cash cost with by-product revenues $ 1,833.5 $ 1,777.1 $ 1,552.9 $ 56.4 3.2 % $ 224.2 14.4 % Total pounds of copper produced(2) 1,924.7 1,599.3 1,453.2 325.4 20.3 % 146.1 10.1 % Operating cash cost per pound without by-product revenues 1.45 1.65 1.89 (0.20 ) (12.1 )% (0.24 ) (12.7 )% Operating cash cost per pound with by-product revenues 0.95 1.11 1.07 (0.16 ) (14.4 )% 0.04 3.7 % (1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 90 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. (2)Net of metallurgical losses. 2016 compared to 2015: As seen on the chart above, our 2016 operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.20 per pound lower than in 2015, a decrease of 12.1%. This was due to lower costs per pound from production costs, as a result of higher production at a lower per-unit cost from the Buenavista projects, lower fuel costs and lower costs per pound from selling, general and administrative expenses and inventory change, partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges and premiums. Our cash cost per pound for 2016 when calculated with by-product revenues was $0.95 per pound, compared to $1.11 per pound in 2015, a decrease of 14.4%. The total value of by-products increased by 75 Table of Contents $88.8 million in 2016, principally due to the higher sales volume and the higher sales prices for silver and zinc, reduced somewhat by decreases in molybdenum volume and sales prices. 2015 compared to 2014: As seen on the chart above, our 2015 operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.24 per pound lower than in 2014, a decrease of 12.7%. This was due to lower costs per pound from production costs, as a result of higher production, lower labor expenses, fuel and power costs; and lower costs per pound from selling, general and administrative expenses and capitalized leachable material included in cost of sales, partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges and premium. Our cash cost per pound for 2015 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.11 per pound, compared to $1.07 per pound in 2014, an increase of 3.7%. This was due to lower credits of our by-products, mainly because of lower prices. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. For 2017, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 113.4 $ 25.6 $ 23.8 $ 23.7 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities. Segment information is included in our review of ""Results of Operations"" in this item and also in Note 18 ""Segment and Related Information"" of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"" for more detailed information. 76 Table of Contents Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $1,118.5 million in 2016, $1,250.0 million in 2015 (including the El Pilar acquisition) and $1,529.8 million in 2014. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. The table below sets forth our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2016 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Peruvian projects: Toquepala expansion project $ 164.2 $ 56.5 $ 65.7 Toquepala mine equipment acquisition project 94.2 2.8 — HPGR system—Toquepala 17.0 5.6 — Heavy mineral management optimizing project—Cuajone 76.6 50.0 31.3 Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam 18.3 0.7 2.9 Other projects 19.1 21.0 40.7 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 389.4 136.6 140.6 Maintenance and replacement 210.5 185.7 213.2 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid (58.9 ) (37.1 ) — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Peruvian expenditures 541.0 285.2 353.8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Mexican projects: New Buenavista concentrator 70.7 238.4 465.2 Buenavista projects infrastructure 46.6 89.6 65.8 Buenavista SX-EW plant III — 11.0 175.8 Quebalix IV 104.7 99.4 70.4 New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine 65.7 47.8 — Solutions system improvements of Tinajas 42.5 34.2 — New system recovery solutions — 14.9 66.2 El Pilar mine — 100.4 — Other projects 94.5 92.4 101.8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 424.7 728.1 945.2 Maintenance and replacement 142.2 216.9 235.8 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid 10.6 19.8 (5.0 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Mexican expenditures 577.5 964.8 1,176.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total capital investments $ 1,118.5 $ 1,250.0 $ 1,529.8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In 2017, we plan to invest $1,105.2 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico: We have concluded our $3.5 billion investment program in Mexico and all of the projects under this program will be in full operation in 2017. Buenavista Projects—Sonora: The Buenavista program is being completed on time and $100 million below our budget, including the crushing, conveying and spreading system for leachable ore project (Quebalix IV). This project will reduce processing time as well as mining and hauling costs, increasing production by improving SX-EW copper recovery. The installed conveyor system is operating steadily. The project has reached 99% progress and $285.7 million have been invested as of December 31, 2016 from a budget of $444.2 million. 77 Table of Contents Projects in Peru: We are currently working on five copper projects in Peru with a total capital investment for these projects of $2,900 million. Toquepala Concentrator Expansion Project—Tacna: This $1.2 billion project includes a new state-of-the-art concentrator which will increase annual copper production by 100,000 tons to 217,000 tons in 2018 and 260,000 tons in 2019, and will also increase annual molybdenum production by 3,100 tons. Through December 31, 2016, we have invested $550.4 million in the project. The project has reached 53% progress and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. The project to improve the crushing process at Toquepala with the installation of a High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) system, has as its main objective, to ensure that our existing concentrator will operate at its maximum milling capacity of 60,000 tons per day, even with an increase of the ore material hardness index. Additionally, recoveries will be improved and production enhanced with a better ore crushing. The budget for this project is $40 million and as of December 31, 2016, we have invested $21.9 million in this project. We expect that it will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017. Cuajone Projects—Moquegua: The Heavy Mineral Management Optimizing Project consists of installing a primary crusher at the Cuajone mine pit with a conveyor system for moving the ore to the concentrator. The project aims to optimize the hauling process by replacing rail haulage, thereby reducing operating and maintenance costs as well as the environmental impact of the Cuajone mine. The crusher will have a processing capacity of 43.8 million tons per year. The main components, including the crusher and the seven kilometer overland conveyor belt, have been acquired and we are well underway with electromechanical assembly. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $150.9 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $215.5 million. The project has reached 80% progress and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2017. The Cuajone tailing thickeners project at the concentrator will replace two of the three existing thickeners with a new hi-rate thickener. The purpose is to streamline the concentrator flotation process and improve water recovery efficiency, increasing the tailings solids content from 54% to 61%, thereby reducing fresh water consumption and replacing it with recovered water. As of December 31, 2016, we have almost completed the engineering and procurement process and have started the excavation and civil works . We have invested $14.4 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $30 million. The project has reached 62% progress and we expect it to be completed by the second quarter of 2017. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda—Moquegua: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We finished the engineering and procurement is in progress. In order to improve and increase the dam's embankment, we have assigned a construction contractor to install a new cyclone battery station that will allow us to place more slurry at the dams. The project has a total budgeted cost of $116.0 million. We have invested $71.7 million through December 31, 2016 and expect the project to be completed by the second quarter of 2018. Potential projects We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. The year 2017 will be the starting point of a new strategic plan: we will grow copper production capacity to exceed the one 78 Table of Contents million ton milestone by mid-2018, and by 2023 we expect to reach 1.5 million copper tons. This strategic plan includes the following projects: Buenavista- Zinc project: This zinc open pit mine located in our Buenavista complex in Sonora, Mexico will produce 87,800 tons of zinc and 27,500 tons of copper content in concentrates per year with a capital budget of $360 million. Currently, we are reviewing the block model and the mine plan which are expected to be completed in March 2017. Also, we are preparing the basic engineering and will request authorization to begin the detail engineering. As of December 31, 2016 we have invested $14.6 million and expect the project to be completed in 2018. Pilares: This brownfield project located in Sonora, Mexico will produce 35,000 tons of copper per year with an initial capital budget of $200 million which we believe is still subject to further optimization. Pilares is an open-pit mine, located 6 kilometers away from our La Caridad complex, thus, leveraging on La Caridad infrastructure. We are working to define the mineral flow and on a trade-off analysis for a potential expansion of the La Caridad concentrator. In addition, we are analyzing mineral blending alternatives between Pilares and La Caridad in order to improve the copper grade of concentrates. As of December 31, 2016 we have invested $39.9 million and expect the project to be completed in 2018. Tia Maria: We have completed all engineering and have successfully obtained the approval of the environmental impact assessment for the project. We are currently working to obtain the construction license for this 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper per year project with a total capital investment of $1,400 million. In 2017, we expect to continue with our social development programs with the neighboring communities. This greenfield project, located in Arequipa Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process and consequently no emissions into the atmosphere are released. The project will use seawater, transporting it more than 25 kilometers and at 1,000 meters above sea level. The construction of the desalinization plant requires an investment of approximately $95 million. We expect the project to generate 3,500 jobs during the construction phase. When in operation, Tia Maria will directly employ 600 workers and indirectly another 2,000. Through its expected twenty-year life, the project related services will create significant business opportunities in the Arequipa region. Tia Maria has complied with all existing requirements and regulations and therefore the Company trusts that it will soon receive from government authorities the construction licenses and permits required in order to begin construction of this project. El Arco: This is a world class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 2.7 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.399% and 0.11 grams of gold per ton. This project, includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations with an estimated production of 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Between July 2015 and February 2016, we conducted a drilling program of 20,170 meters in order to further define the deposit at lower depths of between 300 and 600 meters. Through December 31, 2016 we have invested $77 million on studies, exploration and land acquisition for the project. Further exploration work is still required to better define the geometry of the deposit towards its west end and at the depths worked. In 2017, we expect to conduct certain exploration activities. In addition, we will begin an engineering study to determine the best way to optimize the project and to update the feasibility study. El Pilar: This is a fully permitted, low capital intensity copper development project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an 79 Table of Contents average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. Average annual production is currently estimated at 35,000 tons of copper cathodes over an initial 13-year mine life, with start of commercial operations forecasted by 2019. On a preliminary basis, we estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. In 2016, we conducted a diamond drilling program of 3,700 meters and a geophysical survey of 40 kilometers in order to confirm the reserves additionally, the results allow us to identify potential areas of interest of oxides and sulfures. In 2017, we expect to conclude the exploration in the north area and to continue with the metallurgical testing. In addition, we expect to begin the revised feasibility study and the project engineering. Los Chancas. This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates indicate the presence of 545 million tons of mineralized material with a copper content of 0.59%, molybdenum content of 0.04% and 0.039 grams of gold per ton as well as, 181 million tons of mineralized leachable material with a total copper content of 0.357%. Los Chancas project includes an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 100,000 tons of copper and 4,500 tons of molybdenum. The estimated capital investment is $2,800 million and is expected to be in operation in 2022. In 2016, we continued b with the development of social and environmental programs with the local communities in order to initiate the environmental impact assessment process in 2017. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, leachable material and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $6.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as ""current average prices."" Our current average prices for copper are 80 Table of Contents calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt's Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2016: 2016 2015 2014 Average 2016 - 2014 Copper ($ per pound) $ 2.20 $ 2.51 $ 3.12 $ 2.61 Molybdenum ($ per pound) $ 6.42 $ 6.59 $ 11.30 $ 8.10 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see ""Assets impairment"" below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices), for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 ""Properties—caption Ore reserves."" Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Through the third quarter of 2014, the cost attributed to the produced leach material was charged to cost of sales over a five-year period, which was the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine. However, the improvements in efficiency in production and use of leachable material, as a result of the completion of construction of a new plant during the fourth quarter of 2014, resulted in a change in amortization of leachable material to the units of production method. This was accounted for prospectively in 2014 and will better match costs with revenues resulting from the increases in production stemming from the new plant. As the plant entered into operation in the fourth quarter of 2014, the impact to results in 2014 was not considered significant and totaled approximately $17 million recognized within cost of sales. The Company expects that the impacts in future periods will be significant as a result of the increased production levels, which can be seen in the increased production in Buenavista due to the new SX-EW III plant. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 ""Asset Retirement Obligation"" to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 81 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in ""Provisionally Priced Sales"" under this Item 7). Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company's operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 ""Income Taxes"" to record these liabilities. (See Note 8 ""Income Taxes"" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, reflective of what we believe is the lower level of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash 82 Table of Contents flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.20 to 4.00 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value.

Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2017 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. As of December 31, 2016, $509.7 million of the Company´s total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $600.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. At December 31, 2016, Minera Mexico determined that it has $470.5 million in earnings available for dividends to the United States. These earnings have not been remitted, but U.S. federal income tax, net of foreign tax credit utilization was recognized in 2016 resulting in an increase tax of $45.7 million. At December 31, 2015, Minera Mexico had determined that it had no remittable earnings available for dividends to the United States due to its internal financial obligations and expansion plans and had met the indefinite reversal criteria of ASC 740-30-25-17 that it intended to reinvest its earnings indefinitely. Any distribution of earning from our Mexican subsidiaries to the United States is subject to a U.S. federal income tax that equates to approximately 10% of the amount of the distribution, after considering foreign tax credit utilization.Distributions of earnings from our Peruvian branch to the United States are not subject to repatriation taxes. Our Peruvian operations are not foreign subsidiaries. Rather they are mainly comprised of operations that are treated as a branch of our U.S. operations from a tax perspective. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our BOD authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2016, we have purchased 119.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.9 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—SCC common stock repurchase plan."" Dividend: On January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors (""BOD"") authorized a dividend of $0.08 per share payable on February 28, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2017. 93 Table of Contents FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2016 was $5,954.2 million, compared to $5,951.5 million at December 31, 2015, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par of $97.0 million and $99.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.89%. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 50.4% at December 31, 2016, compared to 52.9% at December 31, 2015. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 47.7% at December 31, 2016, compared to 48.9% at December 31, 2015. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"" below. Please see Note 11 ""Financing"" for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: Payments due by Period Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 6,051.1 $ — $ — $ — $ 400.0 $ — $ 5,651.1 Interest on debt 7,613.7 356.5 356.5 356.5 341.3 335.0 5,867.9 Uncertain tax position(a) 304.0 — — — — — — Workers' participation 125.4 125.4 — — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 26.3 3.0 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.6 13.3 Asset retirement obligation 216.5 0.2 — — — — 216.3 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 3,890.1 259.0 254.9 254.9 254.9 254.9 2,611.5 Capital investment projects 1,447.2 785.2 662.0 — — — — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 19,674.3 $ 1,529.3 $ 1,275.8 $ 613.9 $ 998.7 $ 592.5 $ 14,360.1 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2016, the tax liability recognized by the Company is $304 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet. 94 Table of Contents Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $97.0 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2016. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 ""Financing"" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers' participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers' participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch's taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker's salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers' participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 ""Benefit Plans"" of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 ""Asset Retirement Obligation."" We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Engie Energia Peru S.A., ""Engie"" (formerly Enersur S.A.) through April 2017. In June 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with the state company Electroperu S.A., which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2037. In July 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa, which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2027. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, under which Kallpa will supply energy for the Peruvian operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever happens first. Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 ""Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments"". Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine, and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine. 95 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of ""Operating Cash Cost"" (see page 71) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2016 2015 2014 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 3,034.1 $ 1.58 $ 2,927.6 $ 1.83 $ 2,840.5 $ 1.96 Add: Selling, general and administrative 94.3 0.05 99.4 0.06 103.4 0.07 Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges 24.4 0.01 (34.5 ) (0.02 ) (44.2 ) (0.03 ) Less: Workers' participation (130.2 ) (0.07 ) (116.1 ) (0.07 ) (204.4 ) (0.14 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (329.9 ) (0.17 ) (351.8 ) (0.22 ) (160.9 ) (0.11 ) Royalty charge and other, net (65.6 ) (0.03 ) (72.9 ) (0.05 ) (21.5 ) (0.02 ) Inventory change 162.0 0.08 192.2 0.12 226.4 0.16 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost without by-product revenues $ 2,789.1 $ 1.45 $ 2,643.9 $ 1.65 $ 2,739.3 $ 1.89 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: By-product revenues(1) (904.9 ) (0.47 ) (806.1 ) (0.50 ) (1,153.6 ) (0.80 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (50.7 ) (0.03 ) (60.7 ) (0.04 ) (32.8 ) (0.02 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: Total by-product revenues (955.6 ) (0.50 ) (866.8 ) (0.54 ) (1,186.4 ) (0.82 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost with by-product revenues 1,833.5 0.95 1,777.1 $ 1.11 $ 1,552.9 $ 1.07 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,924.7 1,599.3 1,453.2 (1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following: 2016 2015 2014 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Molybdenum $ (268.1 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (239.0 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (506.9 ) $ (0.35 ) Silver (246.3 ) (0.13 ) (193.0 ) (0.12 ) (239.4 ) (0.17 ) Zinc (189.3 ) (0.10 ) (148.9 ) (0.09 ) (160.8 ) (0.10 ) Sulfuric Acid (87.6 ) (0.04 ) (127.6 ) (0.08 ) (121.5 ) (0.08 ) Gold (50.6 ) (0.02 ) (35.1 ) (0.02 ) (41.3 ) (0.03 ) Other (63.0 ) (0.04 ) (62.5 ) (0.04 ) (83.7 ) (0.07 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ (904.9 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (806.1 ) $ (0.50 ) $ (1,153.6 ) $ (0.80 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 96 Table of Contents The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 141 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to ""Metal Prices"" in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales. Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2016, are provided in the table below: 2016 2015 2014 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 3.2 % 4.4 % 3.2 % Initial exchange rate 3.413 2.989 2.796 Closing exchange rate 3.360 3.413 2.989 Appreciation/(devaluation) 1.6 % (14.2 )% (6.9 )% Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 3.4 % 2.1 % 4.1 % Initial exchange rate 17.207 14.718 13.077 Closing exchange rate 20.664 17.207 14.718 Appreciation/(devaluation) (20.1 )% (16.9 )% (12.6 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2016, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ 0.6 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ (0.8 ) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 3.1 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (3.8 ) 98 Table of Contents The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2016.

1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""SCC,"" the"" Company,"" ""our,"" and ""we"") on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 ""Business—Cautionary Statement."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world's largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2017, we invested $1,023.5 million in capital programs, along with $28.8 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world's largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2017, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, totaled 70.6 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 31,286 Peruvian operations 24,421 IMMSA 233 Development projects 14,685 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total 70,625 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following: •Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2017, the average LME and COMEX per pound copper prices were $2.80, approximately 27% higher than 2016. In 2017, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $2.48 to $3.27. Average zinc and molybdenum prices 68 Table of Contents increased in 2017 by 37.9% and 26.6%, respectively, compared to 2016. The average silver price decreased by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. •Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 80% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 5% from molybdenum, 5% from silver, 4% from zinc and 6% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials. •Copper: During the last quarter, the LME copper price has increased significantly, from an average of $2.40 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $3.09 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2017 and up to an average of $3.21 per pound in January 2018. We believe this price improvement is the result of the synchronized economic growth recovery of the major economies. We believe that the world economy is accelerating its growth to an expected 3.9% in 2018. China, the world's largest copper consumer with over 45% of the demand, is expected to continue its growth, in line with its estimated 6.8% GDP increase in 2017. For global refined copper demand in 2018, we expect growth of about 2.1%, which amounts to approximately 500,000 tons of new copper demand. With respect to copper supply, we expect a weak response as a result of the consistent decline in investments by several companies in recent years. Additionally, labor unrest, excess government taxation and technical difficulties are further affecting production. As a result of these factors, we expect a supply growth of approximately 1% in 2018, yielding a copper market deficit this year which will give strong support for copper prices. •Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.3% of our sales in 2017. •Molybdenum: It was about 5.3% of our sales in 2017. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.72 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2017, which compares to $6.58 a year ago; a 32.5% increase. January 2018 prices averaged $11.54 per pound. Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. •Zinc: It has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and the expected production. Through 2017 zinc inventories have decreased over 50% in the major warehouses, improving this metal's price support. Zinc represented 4.9% of our sales in 2017. •Production: In 2018, we will commence production at the new Toquepala concentrator and expect to be able to produce 931,000 tons of copper, a 6% increase from the 877,000 tons we produced in 2017. We also expect to produce 17.5 million ounces of silver, about 10% higher than the 2017 production of 15.9 million ounces. In 2018, we expect to produce 84,600 tons of zinc from our mines, up 23% from 2017 production of 68,665 tons, as a result of the recovery of production at the Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara mines. Additionally, we expect to produce 21,700 tons of molybdenum, an increase of 1.7% due to additional production from Buenavista and the recovery of our Peruvian operations. 69 Table of Contents •Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three-years ended December 2017 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 4,035.6 $ 3,815.6 $ 3,631.5 Percentage increase from prior year 5.8 % 5.1 % 2.2 % Operating costs and expenses in 2017 increased $220.0 million, compared to 2016, mainly due to higher cost of sales in all our operating segments, as well as higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Mexican operations. This was partially offset by lower depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Peruvian operations, lower exploration expenses and a $10.2 million credit related to a previously accrued environmental remediation cost at our Mexican operations which was reversed in the first quarter of 2017. Operating costs and expenses in 2016 increased $184.1 million, compared to 2015, principally due to higher costs of sales at our Mexican operations resulting from the 18.3% increase in copper sales volume, higher depreciation, amortization and depletion on the new assets added to our operations at Buenavista. This was partially offset by lower environmental remediation and exploration expenses. •US tax reform: In December 2017, new U.S. tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law and became effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the U.S. tax reform on the Company's financial statements was a provisional non-cash tax expense of $785.9 million. The reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% applied to the US deferred tax asset increased tax provision by $110.2 million, and the transition tax on the repatriated foreign earnings net of the related deemed paid tax credit increased the provision by $56.1 million. In addition, the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize certain deferred tax assets due to the US tax reform, and related valuation allowances for these deferred tax assets increased the tax provision, as follows: $280.2 million for foreign tax credits, $174.1 million related to the US tax effect of Peruvian deferreds, and $165.3 million related to the US deferred tax asset calculated using a 21% tax rate. •Capital investments: Capital investments were $1,023.5 million for 2017. This is 8.5% lower than in 2016, and represented 140% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. In addition, the Buenavista expansion program was completed on time and under budget. For 2018, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,748.2 million. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our copper volume production to 1.5 million tons by 2025 with the development of new projects. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) ""operating cash costs"" as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. 70 Table of Contents Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2017 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts): Variance 2017 2016 2015 2017 - 2016 2016 - 2015 Copper price LME 2.80 2.21 2.50 0.59 (0.29 ) Pounds of copper sold 1,959.2 1,923.9 1,625.8 35.3 298.1 Net sales $ 6,654.5 $ 5,379.8 $ 5,045.9 $ 1,274.7 $ 333.9 Operating income $ 2,618.9 $ 1,564.2 $ 1,414.4 $ 1,054.7 $ 149.8 Income before income taxes $ 2,302.7 $ 1,256.0 $ 1,189.2 $ 1,046.7 $ 66.8 Net income attributable to SCC $ 728.5 $ 776.5 $ 736.4 $ (48.0 ) $ 40.1 Earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.00 $ 0.93 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.07 Dividends per share $ 0.59 $ 0.18 $ 0.34 $ 0.41 $ (0.16 ) Net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016 by $1,274.7 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher metal prices and slightly higher sales volumes of copper (+1.8%) and zinc (+2.0%), partially offset by lower sales volumes of silver (–2.1%) and molybdenum (–1.7%). Net sales in 2016 were higher than in 2015, mainly as a result of higher sales volume of copper (+18.3%), silver (+18.9%) and zinc (+4.6%), partially offset by lower prices for copper and molybdenum. The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2017, cost of sales increased by $218.7 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $24.0 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2017 was mainly due to inventory consumption, foreign currency effect and higher workers' participation expense. In 2016, cost of sales increased by $106.5 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $136.4 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2016 was due to higher copper sales volume, which increased by 18.3%. The increase in depreciation was mainly due to investment and maintenance capital acquisitions at most of our operations. Net income attributable to SCC in 2017 was 6.2% lower than in 2016 mainly due to the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million as a result of the US income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 7 ""Income Taxes"", of our consolidated financial statements. Income before income taxes in 2017 was $2,302.7 million or 83.3% higher than 2016 income before taxes of $1,256.0 million. This improvement resulted from higher sales and cost reductions achieved in electricity (–8.0%), tires (–9.4%), and other cost elements. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2017: Variance (million pounds, except silver—million ounces) 2017 2016 2015 2017 - 2016 2016 - 2015 Volume % Volume % Copper 1,933.4 1,984.1 1,638.0 (50.7 ) (2.6 )% 346.1 21.1 % Molybdenum 47.0 47.9 51.5 (0.9 ) (1.9 )% (3.6 ) (6.9 )% Zinc 151.4 163.1 136.5 (11.7 ) (7.2 )% 26.6 19.5 % Silver 15.9 16.2 13.3 (0.3 ) (1.5 )% 2.9 21.7 % 71 Table of Contents The table below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2017: Variance Copper (in million pounds): 2017 2016 2015 2017 - 2016 2016 - 2015 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 326.3 311.8 316.6 14.5 4.7 % (4.8 ) (1.5 )% Cuajone 348.6 378.0 392.8 (29.4 ) (7.8 )% (14.8 ) (3.8 )% La Caridad 296.9 293.8 288.9 3.1 1.1 % 4.9 1.7 % Buenavista 949.5 986.4 627.4 (36.9 ) (3.7 )% 359.0 57.2 % IMMSA 12.1 14.1 12.3 (2.0 ) (14.7 )% 1.8 14.9 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total mined copper 1,933.4 1,984.1 1,638.0 (50.7 ) (2.6 )% 346.1 21.1 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2017 compared to 2016: Copper mine production in 2017 decreased 2.6% to 1,933.4 million pounds from 1,984.1 million pounds in 2016. This decrease was due to: • Lower production at the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades and recoveries. • Lower production at our Mexican mines, principally lower SX-EW production at the Buenavista mine due to lower PLS processed with a lower copper content. • The decrease in production was partially offset by higher production at the Toquepala mine due to higher ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production slightly decreased 1.9% in 2017 compared to 2016, principally due to lower production at our Peruvian operations as a result of lower grades and recoveries. This decrease was partially offset by the additional production from the Buenavista molybdenum plant at the second concentrator which started production in July 2016. Silver mine production decreased 1.5% in 2017 as a result of lower production at our IMMSA mines partially offset by higher production at our open-pit mines in Mexico and Peru. Zinc production decreased 7.2% in 2017 principally due to lower production at our Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara mines due to lower mineral milled and lower grades. 2016 compared to 2015: Mined copper in 2016 increased 346.1 million pounds, compared to 2015 production. This increase was due to: • Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to the ramping up of the new concentrator and better concentrate grades and recoveries. • Higher production at the La Caridad mine due to higher concentrate grades, partially offset by • Lower production at the Cuajone and Toquepala mines due to lower ore grades and concentrate recoveries. Molybdenum production decreased 3.6 million pounds in 2016, compared to 2015, principally due to lower production at our Peruvian mines because of lower grades. Silver production increased 2.9 million ounces in 2016 due to higher production at our Buenavista and IMMSA mines. Zinc production increased by 26.6 million pounds in 2016 due to a year of full production without the flooding problems that we encountered in prior years. 72 Table of Contents Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"" on page 87. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers' participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers' participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure netting the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community's view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project's potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. 73 Table of Contents Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2017: Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2017 - 2016 2016 - 2015 2017 2016 2015 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost before by-product revenues $ 2,797.5 $ 2,779.8 $ 2,643.9 $ 17.7 0.6 % $ 135.9 5.1 % Total by-product revenues (1,080.4 ) (955.6 ) (866.8 ) (124.8 ) 13.1 % (88.8 ) 10.2 % Total operating cash cost net of by-product revenues $ 1,717.1 $ 1,824.2 $ 1,777.1 $ (107.1 ) (5.9 )% $ 47.1 2.7 % Total pounds of copper produced(2) 1,874.5 1,924.7 1,599.3 (50.2 ) (2.6 )% 325.4 20.3 % Operating cash cost per pound before by-product revenues 1.49 1.44 1.65 0.05 3.5 % (0.21 ) (12.7 )% Operating cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues 0.92 0.95 1.11 (0.03 ) (3.2 )% (0.16 ) (14.4 )% (1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 87 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. (2)Net of metallurgical losses. 2017 compared to 2016: Our cash cost per pound before by-product revenues in 2017 was $2,797.5, 0.6% higher than in 2016. This increase in operating cash cost was mainly the result of higher production costs. However, our per pound cash cost for 2017, when calculated net of by-product revenues was 3.2% lower than in 2016. This was the result of higher prices for our major by-products and higher zinc sales volume. 2016 compared to 2015: As seen on the chart above, our 2016 operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product revenues was $0.21 per pound lower than in 2015, a decrease of 12.7%. This was due to lower costs per pound from production costs, as a result of higher production at a lower per-unit cost from the Buenavista projects, lower fuel costs and lower costs per pound from selling, general and administrative expenses and inventory change, partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges and premiums. Our cash cost per pound for 2016 when calculated net of by-product revenues was $0.95 per pound, compared to $1.11 per pound in 2015, a decrease of 14.4%. The total value of by-products increased by $88.8 million in 2016, principally due to the higher sales volume and the higher sales prices for silver and zinc, reduced somewhat by decreases in molybdenum volume and sales prices. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, 74 Table of Contents inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. For 2018, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that 2017 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 143.9 $ 32.0 $ 16.9 $ 14.9 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities. Segment information is included in our review of ""Results of Operations"" in this item and also in Note 17 ""Segment and Related Information"" of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"" for more detailed information. Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $1,023.5 million in 2017, $1,118.5 million in 2016 (including the El Pilar acquisition) and $1,250.0 million in 2015 (including the El Pilar acquisition). In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. 75 Table of Contents The table below sets forth our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2017 (in millions): Peruvian projects: 2017 2016 2015 Toquepala expansion project $ 362.0 $ 164.2 $ 56.5 Toquepala mine equipment acquisition project 39.7 94.2 2.8 Heavy mineral management optimizing project—Cuajone 81.7 76.6 50.0 Ilo 3 substation 29.9 3.7 6.5 HPGR system—Toquepala 18.8 17.0 5.6 Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam 15.5 18.3 0.7 Other projects 14.4 15.4 14.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 562.0 389.4 136.6 Maintenance and replacement 153.1 210.5 185.7 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid (29.7 ) (58.9 ) (37.1 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Peruvian expenditures 685.4 541.0 285.2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Mexican projects: New Buenavista concentrator 24.7 70.7 238.4 Buenavista projects infrastructure 1.9 46.6 89.6 Buenavista SX-EW plant III 1.1 — 11.0 Quebalix IV 17.6 104.7 99.4 New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine 79.2 65.7 47.8 Solutions system improvements of Tinajas 14.5 42.5 34.2 New system recovery solutions — — 14.9 El Pilar mine — — 100.4 Other projects 63.0 94.5 92.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 202.0 424.7 728.1 Maintenance and replacement 144.7 142.2 216.9 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid (8.6 ) 10.6 19.8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Mexican expenditures 338.1 577.5 964.8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total capital investments $ 1,023.5 $ 1,118.5 $ 1,250.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In 2018, we plan to invest $1,748.2 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico: Buenavista Zinc—Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista facility and contemplates the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of additional copper per year that will allow us to double our current zinc production capacity. We have concluded the basic engineering and we are working on the purchasing process for the main project components. We estimate an investment of $413 million for this project and expect to initiate operations in 2020. Pilares—Sonora: This project, located six kilometers from La Caridad, will be developed as an open-pit mine operation. The ore will be transported by truck from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator, significantly improving the over-all mineral ore grade (from 0.34% at La Caridad to 0.78% expected from Pilares). Currently, we continue with the mine plan preparation, including the final outline design for the road through which the ore will be transported to the La Caridad mill. An investment of $159 million is estimated to produce 35,000 tons of copper in concentrates per year. We expect this project to start operations in 2019. 76 Table of Contents Projects in Peru: We currently have a portfolio of projects in Peru, with a total capital budget of $2,900 million, out of which $1,620 million have already been invested. Toquepala Expansion Project—Tacna: This $1.2 billion project includes a new state-of-the-art concentrator which will increase Toquepala's annual copper production by 100,000 tons to reach 245,000 tons in 2019, a 69% production increase. Through December 31, 2017, we have invested $892.9 million in this expansion. The project has reached 87% progress and is expected to initiate production in June 2018. The project to improve the crushing process at Toquepala with the installation of a High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) system, has as its main objective, to ensure that our existing concentrator will operate at its maximum annual production capacity of 117,000 tons of copper while reducing operating costs through ore crushing efficiencies, even with an increase of the ore material hardness index. The budget for this project is $50 million and as of December 31, 2017, we have invested $38.9 million in this project. We expect that it will be completed by the first quarter of 2018. Cuajone Projects—Moquegua: The Mineral Crushing and Hauling Project consisted of replacing rail haulage at the Cuajone mine by an in-pit primary crusher with a 7 km overland conveyor belt system to move ore to the concentrator. Operating savings are estimated at $23 million annually. As of December 31, 2017, the project is already completed and in operation. Total investment was $226 million, as budgeted. The Cuajone tailing thickeners project at the concentrator will replace two of the three existing thickeners with a new hi-rate thickener. The purpose is to streamline the concentrator flotation process and improve water recovery efficiency, increasing the tailings solids content from 54% to 61%, thereby reducing fresh water consumption and replacing it with recovered water. Equipment assembly is completed and we are in the commissioning process. As of December 31, 2017, we have invested $27.6 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $30 million. We expect the project to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda—Moquegua: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We finished the second stage with the installation of a new cyclone battery station that allows us to place more slurry at the dams. We are in a bidding process for a new stage which will improve the operational processes. The project has a total budgeted cost of $116.0 million. We have invested $85.7 million through December 31, 2017 and expect the project to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2018. Potential projects: We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our annual copper production to 1.5 million tons by 2025 with the development of new projects, which include the following: El Arco: This is a world class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 2.7 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.399% and 0.11 grams of gold per ton. This project, includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations with 77 Table of Contents an estimated production of 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Between July 2015 and February 2016, we conducted a drilling program of 20,170 meters in order to further define the deposit at lower depths of between 300 and 600 meters. In 2018, we expect to conduct further exploration activities. In addition, we will begin an engineering study to define optimization alternatives for the project and update the feasibility study, besides further analysis in the electrical energy supply. El Pilar: This is a fully permitted, low capital intensity copper development project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. Average annual production is currently estimated at 35,000 tons of copper cathodes over an initial 13-year mine life, with start of commercial operations forecasted for 2019. On a preliminary basis, we estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. In 2016, we conducted a diamond drilling program of 3,700 meters and a geophysical survey of 40 kilometers in order to confirm the reserves. Additionally, the results allowed us to identify potential new areas of interest. During the first half of 2017, we initiated a reserve estimation program. In July 2017, we started a 20,000 meter drilling program focused on further assessing the geophysical anomalies detected in the exploration program of 2016. During 2018 we will continue with the metallurgical testing program and the leaching optimization studies. Tia Maria: We have completed engineering and after having complied with all environmental requirements, we have obtained the approval of the environmental impact assessment. We are working jointly with the Peruvian Government to obtain the construction license for this 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper per year greenfield project with a total capital investment of $1,400 million. We expect the license to be issued in the first half of 2018. This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process with no emissions released into the atmosphere. The project will use seawater, transporting it more than 25 kilometers to an altitude of 1,000 meters above sea level. The construction of the desalinization plant requires an investment of approximately $95 million. We expect the project to generate 3,600 jobs during the construction phase. When in operation, Tia Maria will directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs to another 4,200. Through its expected twenty-year life, the project related services will create significant business opportunities in the Arequipa region. Tia Maria has complied with all existing requirements and regulations and therefore the Company trusts that it will soon receive from government authorities the construction licenses and permits required in order to begin construction of this project. Los Chancas. This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates indicate the presence of 545 million tons of mineralized material with a copper content of 0.59%, molybdenum content of 0.04% and 0.039 grams of gold per ton as well as, 181 million tons of mineralized leachable material with a total copper content of 0.357%. Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum. The estimated capital investment is $2,800 million and is expected to be in operation in 2022. In 2016 and 2017, we continued with the development of social and environmental improvements for the local communities in order to conduct the environmental impact assessment, which will begin in the first months of 2018. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. 78 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, leachable material and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $7.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as ""current average prices."" Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt's Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2017: 2017 2016 2015 Average 2017 - 2015 Copper ($ per pound) $ 2.80 $ 2.20 $ 2.51 $ 2.50 Molybdenum ($ per pound) $ 8.21 $ 6.42 $ 6.59 $ 7.07 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see ""Assets impairment"" below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices), for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 ""Properties—caption Ore reserves."" Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the 79 Table of Contents production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 9 ""Asset Retirement Obligation"" to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in ""Provisionally Priced Sales"" under this Item 7). Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company's operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 80 Table of Contents ""Income Taxes"" to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 ""Income Taxes"" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Act""). The Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Act. The accounting is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2018 in accordance with SAB 118. For further information, see Note 7 ""Income Taxes"", of our consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, reflective of what we believe is the lower level of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.15 to 4.05 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. 81 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 (in millions): Variance Statement of Earnings Data 2017 2016 2015 2017 - 2016 2016 - 2015 Net sales $ 6,654.5 $ 5,379.8 $ 5,045.9 $ 1,274.7 $ 333.9 Operating costs and expenses (4,035.6 ) (3,815.6 ) (3,631.5 ) (220.0 ) (184.1 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating income 2,618.9 1,564.2 1,414.4 1,054.7 149.8 Non-operating income (expense) (316.2 ) (308.2 ) (225.2 ) (8.0 ) (83.0 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income before income taxes 2,302.7 1,256.0 1,189.2 1,046.7 66.8 Current income taxes and royalty taxes (951.7 ) (623.6 ) (620.3 ) (328.1 ) (3.3 ) Deferred income taxes (641.7 ) 122.5 155.4 (764.2 ) (32.9 ) Equity earnings of affiliate 23.1 23.9 16.8 (0.8 ) 7.1 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest (3.9 ) (2.3 ) (4.7 ) (1.6 ) 2.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net income attributable to SCC $ 728.5 $ 776.5 $ 736.4 $ (48.0 ) $ 40.1 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NET SALES 2017-2016: Net sales in 2017 were $6,654.5 million, compared to $5,379.8 million in 2016, an increase of $1,274.7 million. This 23.7% increase was principally the result of higher metal prices as shown below, and also due to slightly higher sales volumes of copper (+1.8%) and zinc (+2.0%), partially offset by lower sales volumes of silver (–2.1%) and molybdenum (–1.7%). 2016-2015: Net sales in 2016 were $5,379.8 million, compared to $5,045.9 million in 2015, an increase of $333.9 million or 6.6%. The increase was principally the result of higher sales volume of copper (+18.3%) and silver (+18.9%), partially offset by lower prices for copper and molybdenum.

The $8.0 million variance in net expense in 2017 was mainly due to: • $ 18.2 million of lower capitalized interest mainly due to an adjustment in capitalized interest computation, • $ 1.6 million of lower interest income; partially offset by, • $ 8.9 million of lower miscellaneous expense, net; and, • $ 2.9 million of lower interest expense. 2016-2015: Non-operating income and expense were a net expense of $308.2 million in 2016 compared to a net expense of $225.2 million in 2015. The $83.0 million increase in net expense in 2016 was mainly due to: • $53.6 million of lower capitalized interest, as completed Buenavista projects have been transferred to operations, • $26.3 million of higher interest expense related to the $2 billion bond issue, in April 2015, • $3.8 million of lower interest income; partially offset by, • $0.7 million of higher miscellaneous income. 84 Table of Contents Income taxes 2017 2016 2015 Provision for income taxes ($ in millions) $ 1,593.4 $ 501.1 $ 464.9 Effective income tax rate 69.2 % 39.9 % 39.1 % The income tax provision includes Peruvian, Mexican and U.S. federal and state income taxes. Components of income tax provision for 2017, 2016 and 2015 include the following ($ in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Statutory income tax provision $ 688.5 $ 441.1 $ 423.1 Tax reform adjustment 785.9 — — Peruvian royalty 2.5 — 2.7 Mexican royalty 93.2 48.9 20.9 Peruvian special mining tax 23.3 11.1 18.2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total income tax provision $ 1,593.4 $ 501.1 $ 464.9 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The effect of U.S. tax reform on the company's financial statements was a provisional non-cash tax provision of $785.9 million. The reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% applied to the US deferred tax asset increased tax provision by $110.2 million and the transition tax on the repatriated foreign earnings net of the related deemed paid tax credit increased the provision by $56.1 million. In addition, the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize certain deferred tax assets due to the US tax reform, and related valuation allowances for these deferred tax assets increased the tax provision as follows: $280.2 million for foreign tax credits, $174.1 million related to the US tax effect of Peruvian deferreds, $165.3 million related to the US deferred tax asset calculated using a 21% tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 from the prior year was primarily due to the effects of US tax reform, which added 34.1% to the effective tax rate: 26.9% for valuation of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits, the US tax effect of Peruvian deferreds, and the US deferred tax asset, 4.8% for the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% applied to the US deferred tax asset, and 2.4% for the transition tax on the repatriated foreign earnings net of the related deemed paid tax credit. The remaining changes in the effective income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 partially offset the increase from the impact of the U.S. tax reform by 4.8%, which such decrease is mainly due to tax accrued on 2016 on foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 from the prior year was primarily due to the repatriation of foreign income to the U.S. jurisdiction from our Mexican Operations net of a decrease in permanent differences including exchange gain or loss, which is non-deductible in the Peruvian jurisdiction. Please see Note 7 ""Income taxes"" of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding tax changes. Equity earnings of affiliate In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we have recognized $23.1 million, $23.9 million and $16.8 million, respectively of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2017 was $3.9 million, compared to $2.3 million in 2016, and $4.7 million in 2015. It increased in 2017 by $1.6 million and decreased in 85 Table of Contents 2016 by $2.4 million. These changes were the result of higher and lower earnings at our Peruvian operations in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2017 was $728.5 million, compared to $776.5 million in 2016 and $736.4 million in 2015. Net income attributable to SCC decreased in 2017 due to the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million as a result of the US income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by higher sales and cost reductions achieved in electricity (–8.0%), tires (–9.4%), and other cost elements. The increase in 2016 net income was mainly a result of higher copper sales volume.

These included $577.5 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $541.0 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item on page 71. The 2016 investing activities also include net sales of short-term investments of $552.1 million, and a repayment of $111.2 million received from a related party. 2015: Net cash used for investing activities in 2015 included $1,149.6 million for capital investments. These included $964.8 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $285.2 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item on page 71. The 2015 investing activities also include net purchases of short-term investments of $264.8 million and $100.4 million for the acquisition of the El Pilar mining property, and a repayment of $50 million received from a related party. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities: 2017: Net cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $456.1 million and included a dividend distribution of $456.1 million. 2016: Net cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $210.7 million and included: • A dividend distribution of $139.3 million. • The repurchase of 2.9 million of our common shares at a cost of $71.7 million. 92 Table of Contents 2015: Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $492.2 million and included: • Gross proceeds of $2,045.8 million from the issuance of unsecured notes, net of an underwriting discount and $66 million of short-term borrowing in Peru. • Repayment of a short-term Peruvian loan of $66 million, and the repayment of $200 million of ten year senior unsecured notes. • A dividend distribution of $271.2 million. • The repurchase of 36.7 million of our common shares at a cost of $1,004.4 million. • Payment of debt issuance cost of $11.8 million. • A distribution of $0.5 million to the non-controlling interest. Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2018 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. As of December 31, 2017, $517.7 million of the Company´s total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1,055.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. At December 31, 2016, Minera Mexico determined that it had $470.5 million in earnings available for dividends to the United States. These earnings had not been remitted, but U.S. federal income tax, net of foreign tax credit was recognized in 2016 resulting in an increase tax of $45.7 million. At December 31, 2017, Minera Mexico had determined that it had earnings available for dividends to the United States of $555.5 million. The 2017 U.S. tax reform introduced a one-time transition tax that is based upon the Company's total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (""E&P"") estimated to be $8.9 billion, the majority of which was previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes were provided. Upon enactment of the 2017 U.S. tax reform, the Company calculated and recorded a provisional tax amount of $181.1 million as a reasonable estimate for its one-time transition tax liability, which was completely offset by foreign tax credit carryforwards. Because of the complexities of tax reform and the transition tax calculation, the Company is still finalizing its calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 prescribed E&P for the applicable entities. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in liquid and non-liquid E&P. Until the calculation of E&P is completed and the transition tax is finalized during 2018 it is not practicable to estimate any amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability, if any, to any additional outside basis differences in the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Earnings from the Company's Peruvian branch to the United States are not subject to transition taxes since they are taxed on a current basis, regardless of remittances. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our BOD authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2017, we have purchased 119.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.9 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—SCC common stock repurchase plan."" Dividend: On January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors (""BOD"") authorized a dividend of $0.30 per share paid on February 27, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2018. 93 Table of Contents FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2017 was $5,957.1 million, compared to $5,954.2 million at December 31, 2016, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par of $94.1 million and $97.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.89%. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 49.2% at December 31, 2017, compared to 50.4% at December 31, 2016. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 44.4% at December 31, 2017, compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"" below. Please see Note 10 ""Financing"" for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: Payments due by Period Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 6,051.1 $ — $ — $ 400.0 $ — $ 300.0 $ 5,351.1 Interest on debt 7,257.3 356.5 356.5 341.3 334.9 333.4 5,534.7 Uncertain tax position(a) 214.5 — — — — — — Workers' participation 176.9 176.9 — — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 31.4 3.2 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 17.2 Asset retirement obligation 234.1 — — — — — 234.1 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 3,016.0 356.1 356.1 358.4 358.4 365.5 1,221.5 Capital investment projects 1,409.3 508.8 428.5 330.0 142.0 — — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 18,390.6 $ 1,401.5 $ 1,143.7 $ 1,432.4 $ 838.1 $ 1,001.8 $ 12,358.6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)The above table does not include any scheduled payments related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash 94 Table of Contents outflows. As of December 31, 2017, the tax liability recognized by the Company is $214.5 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $94.1 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2017. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 ""Financing"" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers' participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers' participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch's taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker's salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers' participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 11 ""Benefit Plans"" of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 9 ""Asset Retirement Obligation."" In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (""MW"") with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (""Kallpa""), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, under which Kallpa will supply energy for the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first. Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 12 ""Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments"". Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects, and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine. 95 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of ""Operating Cash Cost"" (see page 69) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2017 2016 2015 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 3,252.8 $ 1.74 $ 3,034.1 $ 1.58 $ 2,927.6 $ 1.83 Add: Selling, general and administrative 93.1 0.05 94.3 0.05 99.4 0.06 Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges 22.4 0.01 24.4 0.01 (34.5 ) (0.02 ) Less: Workers' participation (196.4 ) (0.11 ) (130.2 ) (0.07 ) (116.1 ) (0.07 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (363.2 ) (0.19 ) (329.9 ) (0.17 ) (351.8 ) (0.22 ) Royalty charge and other, net (150.3 ) (0.08 ) (74.9 ) (0.04 ) (72.9 ) (0.05 ) Inventory change 139.1 0.07 162.0 0.08 192.2 0.12 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost before by-product revenues $ 2,797.5 $ 1.49 $ 2,779.8 $ 1.44 $ 2,643.9 $ 1.65 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: By-product revenues(1) (1,030.2 ) (0.55 ) (904.9 ) (0.47 ) (806.1 ) (0.50 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (50.2 ) (0.02 ) (50.7 ) (0.03 ) (60.7 ) (0.04 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: Total by-product revenues (1,080.4 ) (0.57 ) (955.6 ) (0.50 ) (866.8 ) (0.54 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost net of by-product revenues 1,717.1 0.92 1,824.2 0.95 1,777.1 $ 1.11 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,874.5 1,924.7 1,599.3 (1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following: 2017 2016 2015 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Molybdenum $ (353.4 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (268.1 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (239.0 ) $ (0.15 ) Silver (254.9 ) (0.14 ) (246.3 ) (0.13 ) (193.0 ) (0.12 ) Zinc (221.6 ) (0.12 ) (189.3 ) (0.10 ) (148.9 ) (0.09 ) Sulfuric Acid (71.9 ) (0.04 ) (87.6 ) (0.04 ) (127.6 ) (0.08 ) Gold (61.7 ) (0.03 ) (50.6 ) (0.02 ) (35.1 ) (0.02 ) Other (66.7 ) (0.03 ) (63.0 ) (0.04 ) (62.5 ) (0.04 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ (1,030.2 ) $ (0.55 ) $ (904.9 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (806.1 ) $ (0.50 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 136 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties. 96 Table of Contents Net debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 2016 Total debt $ 5,957.1 $ 5,954.2 Cash and cash equivalents (1,004.8 ) (546.0 ) Short-term investments (50.5 ) (51.3 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net debt 4,901.8 5,356.9 Net capitalization: Net debt 4,901.8 5,356.9 Equity 6,149.4 5,870.9 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net capitalization $ 11,051.2 $ 11,227.8 Net debt/net capitalization(*) 44.4 % 47.7 % (*)Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to ""Metal Prices"" in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales. Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2017, are provided in the table below: 2017 2016 2015 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 1.5 % 3.2 % 4.4 % Initial exchange rate 3.360 3.413 2.989 Closing exchange rate 3.245 3.360 3.413 Appreciation/(devaluation) 3.4 % 1.6 % (14.2 )% Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 6.8 % 3.4 % 2.1 % Initial exchange rate 20.664 17.207 14.718 Closing exchange rate 19.735 20.664 17.207 Appreciation/(devaluation) 4.5 % (20.1 )% (16.9 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2017, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ 11.9 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ (14.5 ) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 20.1 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (24.5 ) 98 Table of Contents The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2017.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""SCC,"" ""Southern Copper,"" ""the Company,"" ""our,"" and ""we"") on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 ""Business—Cautionary Statement."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world's largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. Net sales in 2018 were $7.1 billion, the highest amount in Southern Copper history. In 2018, we invested $1,121.4 million in capital programs, along with $29.6 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world's largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2018, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, totaled 69.7 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 31,396 Peruvian operations 23,516 IMMSA 231 Development projects 14,567 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total 69,710 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following: •Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2018, the average LME and COMEX per pound copper prices were $2.96 and $2.93, approximately 5.7% and 4.6% higher than 2017, 70 Table of Contents respectively. In 2018, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $2.64 to $3.29. Average molybdenum and zinc prices increased in 2018 by 45.9% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to 2017. The average silver price decreased by 8.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. •Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 80% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 6% from molybdenum, 5% from silver, 5% from zinc and 4% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials. •Copper: During the last quarter of 2018, the LME per pound copper price decreased 9.3%, from an average of $3.09 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $2.80 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Despite a stable copper physical market, we believe this fall in prices reflects the market uncertainty in connection with a possible escalation of trade protectionism between the United States and China. We anticipate a recovery in copper prices in 2019. In 2018, refined copper demand growth was approximately 3.0%. On the supply side, there were no significant disruptions due to labor negotiations or technical difficulties, leading to an unexpected growth in supply of approximately 2.5%, much higher than the 1.5% forecasted by several analysts at the beginning of 2018. Even though the market was in balance with these marks, there was a significant reduction of copper inventories in 2018, reflecting a refined copper scarcity. From its March 2018 peak of 1.4 million tons, as of January 2019, inventories in the major warehouses decreased to 813,000 tons, a 42% reduction. For 2019, our base case assumes a slowdown in world's economic growth, but not a recession. Consequently, we believe refined copper demand will grow at about 2.5% and supply at 1.5%, yielding a year of market deficit that will put upward pressure on copper prices. •Molybdenum: It represented approximately 7.2% of our sales in 2018. Molybdenum prices averaged $11.86 per pound in 2018, compared to $8.13 in 2017 a 45.9% increase. Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. •Zinc: It has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and the expected production. Zinc represented 4.6% of our sales in 2018. •Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.2% of our sales in 2018. •Production: In the fourth quarter of 2018, we began operations at the new Toquepala concentrator which produced 8,630 tons of copper in 2018. For 2019 we expect to produce 986,700 tons of copper, a 11.7% increase from the 883,689 tons we produced in 2018. We also expect to produce 21.4 million ounces of silver, about 24% higher than the 2018 production of 17.3 million ounces, mainly resulting from the contribution of the San Martin, Santa Barbara and Toquepala mines. In 2019, we expect to produce 96,400 tons of zinc from our mines, up 36% from 2018 production of 70,778 tons, as a result of the recovery of production at the San Martin mine. Additionally, we expect to produce 25,300 tons of molybdenum, an increase of 15% due to the significant contribution of the molybdenum plant at the new Toquepala concentrator. 71 Table of Contents •Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2018 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 4,215.5 $ 4,035.6 $ 3,815.6 Percentage increase from prior year 4.5 % 5.8 % 5.1 % Operating costs and expenses in 2018 increased $179.9 million, compared to 2017, mainly due to higher cost of sales in all our operating segments, principally due to increases in fuel costs and other materials. Operating costs and expenses in 2017 increased $220.0 million, compared to 2016, mainly due to higher cost of sales in all our operating segments, as well as higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Mexican operations. This was partially offset by lower depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Peruvian operations, lower exploration expenses and a $10.2 million credit related to a previously accrued environmental remediation cost at our Mexican operations which was reversed in the first quarter of 2017. •Capital investments: Capital investments were $1,121.4 million for 2018. This is 9.6% higher than in 2017, and represented 72.4% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our copper volume production to 1.5 million tons by 2025 with the development of new projects. For 2019, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,752.8 million. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) ""operating cash costs"" as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2018 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts): Variance 2018 2017 2016 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 Copper price LME 2.96 2.80 2.21 0.16 0.59 Pounds of copper sold 1,953.0 1,959.2 1,923.9 (6.2 ) 35.3 Net sales $ 7,096.7 $ 6,654.5 $ 5,379.8 $ 442.2 $ 1,274.7 Operating income $ 2,881.2 $ 2,618.9 $ 1,564.2 $ 262.3 $ 1,054.7 Income before income taxes $ 2,589.4 $ 2,302.7 $ 1,256.0 $ 286.7 $ 1,046.7 Net income attributable to SCC $ 1,543.0 $ 728.5 $ 776.5 $ 814.5 $ (48.0 ) Earnings per share $ 2.00 $ 0.94 $ 1.00 $ 1.06 $ (0.06 ) Dividends per share $ 1.40 $ 0.59 $ 0.18 $ 0.81 $ 0.41 Net sales in 2018 of $7.1 billion were the highest in our history and were higher than in 2017 by $442.2 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+5.7%) and molybdenum (+45.9%) prices and higher sales volumes of silver (+15.3%) and molybdenum (+3.3%), partially offset by lower silver prices (–8.1%) and lower zinc sales volume (–1.0%). Net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016 by $1,274.7 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher metal prices and slightly higher sales volumes of copper (+1.8%) and zinc (+2.0%), partially offset by lower sales volumes of silver (–2.1%) and molybdenum (–1.7%). 72 Table of Contents The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2018, cost of sales increased by $156.2 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $3.2 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2018 was mainly due to higher fuel costs, higher workers' participation expense and inventory consumption. In 2017, cost of sales increased by $218.7 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $24.0 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2017 was mainly due to inventory consumption, foreign currency effect and higher workers' participation expense. Net income attributable to SCC in 2018 was 111.8% higher than in 2017 mainly due to the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million recorded in 2017 as a result of the U.S. income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to SCC in 2017 was 6.2% lower than in 2016 also due to this adjustment. See Note 7 ""Income Taxes"", of our consolidated financial statements. Income before income taxes in 2018 was $2,589.4 million or 12.5% higher than in 2017 mainly due to higher sales. Income before income taxes in 2017 was $2,302.7 million or 83.3% higher than 2016 income before taxes of $1,256.0 million. This improvement resulted from higher sales and cost reductions achieved in electricity (–8.0%), tires (–9.4%), and other cost elements. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2018: Variance 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 (million pounds, except silver—million ounces) 2018 2017 2016 Volume % Volume % Copper 1,948.2 1,933.4 1,984.1 14.8 0.8 % (50.7 ) (2.6 )% Molybdenum 48.5 47.0 47.9 1.5 3.1 % (0.9 ) (1.9 )% Zinc 156.0 151.4 163.1 4.6 3.1 % (11.7 ) (7.2 )% Silver 17.3 15.9 16.2 1.4 8.7 % (0.3 ) (1.5 )% The table below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2018: Variance 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 Copper (in million pounds): 2018 2017 2016 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 375.4 326.4 311.8 49.0 15.0 % 14.6 4.7 % Cuajone 354.0 348.5 378.0 5.5 1.6 % (29.5 ) (7.8 )% La Caridad 292.1 296.9 293.8 (4.8 ) (1.6 )% 3.1 1.1 % Buenavista 913.0 949.5 986.4 (36.5 ) (3.8 )% (36.9 ) (3.7 )% IMMSA 13.7 12.1 14.1 1.6 13.4 % (2.0 ) (14.7 )% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total mined copper 1,948.2 1,933.4 1,984.1 14.8 0.8 % (50.7 ) (2.6 )% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2018 compared to 2017: Copper mine production in 2018 increased 0.8% to 1,948.2 million pounds from 1,933.4 million pounds in 2017. This increase was due to: • Higher production at the Toquepala and Cuajone mines due to higher ore grades and recoveries, which was partially offset by 73 Table of Contents • Lower production at the Buenavista mine due to lower SX-EW copper production (–20.1%). In 2018, the Company initiated a 12-month corrective program to overcome this temporary reduction in production. The program includes depositing the minerals in different leaching pads depending on the characteristics of the ore. Also, the Company has implemented improvements and controls in the ore fragmentation that occurs in the blasting, to avoid the fine materials that may cause clogging in the recovery process. Molybdenum production increased 3.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine due to higher recoveries. This increase was partially offset by lower production at our Peruvian mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries. Zinc production increased 3.1% in 2018, due to higher production at our Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara mines due to higher mineral milled. Mined silver production increased 8.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, as we had increased silver production at all of our mines, except for our Cuajone mine. 2017 compared to 2016: Copper mine production in 2017 decreased 2.6% to 1,933.4 million pounds from 1,984.1 million pounds in 2016. This decrease was due to: • Lower production at the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades and recoveries. • Lower production at our Mexican mines, principally lower SX-EW production at the Buenavista mine due to lower PLS processed with a lower copper content. • The decrease in production was partially offset by higher production at the Toquepala mine due to higher ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production slightly decreased 1.9% in 2017 compared to 2016, principally due to lower production at our Peruvian operations as a result of lower grades and recoveries. This decrease was partially offset by the additional production from the Buenavista molybdenum plant at the second concentrator which started production in July 2016. Silver mine production decreased 1.5% in 2017 as a result of lower production at our IMMSA mines partially offset by higher production at our open-pit mines in Mexico and Peru. Zinc production decreased 7.2% in 2017 principally due to lower production at our Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara mines due to lower mineral milled and lower grades. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"" on page 90. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers' participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. 74 Table of Contents In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers' participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community's view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project's potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. 75 Table of Contents Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2018: Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1) (In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 2018 2017 2016 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost before by-product revenues $ 2,904.4 $ 2,797.5 $ 2,779.8 $ 106.9 3.8 % $ 17.7 0.6 % Total by-product revenues $ (1,267.7 ) $ (1,080.4 ) $ (955.6 ) $ (187.3 ) 17.3 % (124.8 ) 13.1 % Total operating cash cost net of by-product revenues $ 1,636.7 $ 1,717.1 $ 1,824.2 $ (80.4 ) (4.7 )% $ (107.1 ) (5.9 )% Total pounds of copper produced(2) 1,886.8 1,874.5 1,924.7 12.3 0.7 % (50.2 ) (2.6 )% Operating cash cost per pound before by-product revenues $ 1.54 $ 1.49 $ 1.44 $ 0.05 3.4 % $ 0.05 3.5 % By-products per pound revenues $ (0.67 ) $ (0.57 ) $ (0.49 ) $ (0.10 ) 17.5 % $ (0.08 ) 16.3 % Operating cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues $ 0.87 $ 0.92 $ 0.95 $ (0.05 ) (5.4 )% $ (0.03 ) (3.2 )% (1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 90 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. (2)Net of metallurgical losses. 2018 compared to 2017: Our cash cost per pound before by-product revenues in 2018 was $1.54, 3.4% higher than in 2017. This increase in operating cash cost was mainly due to higher production costs, principally at our Peruvian operations. However, our per pound cash cost for 2018, when calculated net of by-product revenues was 5.4% lower than in 2017. This improvement was mainly the result of higher prices for our major by-products. 2017 compared to 2016: Our cash cost per pound before by-product revenues in 2017 was $1.49, 3.5% higher than in 2016. This increase in operating cash cost was mainly the result of higher production costs. However, our per pound cash cost for 2017, when calculated net of by-product revenues was 3.2% lower than in 2016. This was the result of higher prices for our major by-products and higher zinc sales volume. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. For 2019, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that 2018 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would 76 Table of Contents indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 129.0 $ 33.6 $ 14.5 $ 12.4 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities. Segment information is included in our review of ""Results of Operations"" in this item and also in Note 17 ""Segment and Related Information"" of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"" for more detailed information. Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $1,121.4 million in 2018, $1,023.5 million in 2017 and $1,118.5 million in 2016. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. 77 Table of Contents The table below sets forth our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2018 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Peruvian projects: Toquepala expansion project $ 392.4 $ 362.0 $ 164.2 Toquepala mine equipment acquisition project — 39.7 94.2 Heavy mineral management optimizing project—Cuajone 17.0 81.7 76.6 Ilo 3 substation 1.0 29.9 3.7 HPGR system—Toquepala 7.8 18.8 17.0 Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam 23.7 15.5 18.3 Ilo sulfuric acid plant N°1 modification 15.3 4.4 — Other projects 24.1 10.0 15.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 481.3 562.0 389.4 Maintenance and replacement 201.4 153.1 210.5 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid 91.3 (29.7 ) (58.9 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Peruvian expenditures 774.0 685.4 541.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Mexican projects: New Buenavista concentrator 5.8 24.7 70.7 Buenavista projects infrastructure 2.3 1.9 46.6 Buenavista SX-EW plant III — 1.1 — Quebalix IV 2.0 17.6 104.7 New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine 56.7 79.2 65.7 Over elevation of tailings deposit N° 7 at La Caridad mine 18.3 — — Sonora River water restitution system in Moritas Basin 6.0 — — Solutions system improvements of Tinajas 1.3 14.5 42.5 Other projects 77.0 63.0 94.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sub-total projects 169.4 202.0 424.7 Maintenance and replacement 169.3 144.7 142.2 Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid 8.7 (8.6 ) 10.6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Mexican expenditures 347.4 338.1 577.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total capital investments $ 1,121.4 $ 1,023.5 $ 1,118.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In 2019, we plan to invest $1,752.8 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico: Buenavista Zinc—Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc per year which will allow us to double our current zinc production capacity. Also, the project will produce 20,000 tons of additional copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering and we are working on the purchasing process for the main project components. Water concessions have been requested. We estimate an investment of $413 million for this project and expect to initiate operations in 2021. Pilares—Sonora: This project, located six kilometers from La Caridad, will be developed as an open-pit mine operation. The ore will be transported from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator through a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks, and will significantly improve the over-all mineral ore grade (combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with 0.34% at La Caridad). Environmental permit studies were presented to the government's environmental 78 Table of Contents authorities and additional land is being acquired. An investment of $159 million is estimated to produce 35,000 tons of copper in concentrates per year. We expect this project to start producing in early 2020. Projects in Peru: We currently have a portfolio of Board approved projects in Peru, with a total capital budget of $2,900 million, out of which $1,755 million have already been invested. Toquepala Expansion Project—Tacna: This $1,255 million project includes a new state-of-the-art concentrator which will increase Toquepala's annual copper production by 100,000 tons to reach 258,000 tons in 2019, a 74% production increase, when compared to 2017. Through December 31, 2018, we have invested $1,227 million in this expansion. Construction of the project was completed and production began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Full production is expected to be reached by the second quarter of 2019. The project to improve the crushing process at Toquepala with the installation of a High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) system, has as its main objective, to ensure that our existing concentrator will operate at its maximum annual production capacity of 117,000 tons of copper while reducing operating costs through ore crushing efficiencies, even with an increase of the ore material hardness index. The budget for this project is $50 million and as of December 31, 2018, we have invested $44 million. We are in the administrative close-out process for this project, which was added to operations during the fourth quarter of 2018. Cuajone tailing thickeners project—Moquegua: This project will replace two of the three existing thickeners at the concentrator with a new hi-rate thickener. The purpose is to streamline the concentrator flotation process and improve water recovery efficiency, increasing the tailings solids content from 54% to 61%, thereby reducing fresh water consumption and replacing it with recovered water. Equipment assembly is completed and we are in the commissioning process. As of December 31, 2018, we have invested $30 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $30 million. During the commissioning process, a problem in the design of the thickener was detected and we are currently working on the solution. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda—Moquegua: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We finished the second stage with the installation of a new cyclone battery station that allows us to place more slurry at the dams. We are working to improve several operational processes of this facility. The project has a total budgeted cost of $116 million. We have invested $107 million through December 31, 2018 and expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. Potential projects: We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our annual copper production to 1.5 million tons by 2025 with the development of new projects, which include the following: El Arco—Baja California: This is a world class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves of over 2.7 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.399% and 79 Table of Contents 0.11 grams of gold per ton. This project, includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations with an estimated production of 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Between July 2015 and February 2016, we conducted a drilling program of 20,170 meters in order to further define the deposit at lower depths of between 300 and 600 meters. El Pilar—Sonora: This is a fully permitted, low capital intensity copper development project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. Average annual production is currently estimated at 35,000 tons of copper cathodes over an initial 13-year mine life. On a preliminary basis, we estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. During 2018 we continued with the metallurgical testing program, as well as with social development work with local communities. We are also concluding a preliminary economic study of the project. Tia Maria—Arequipa: We have completed engineering and after having complied with all environmental requirements, we have obtained the approval of the environmental impact assessment. We are working jointly with the Peruvian government to obtain the construction license for this 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper per year greenfield project with a total capital investment of $1,400 million. We expect to receive the construction license for this project in the first half of 2019. In addition to our on-going social work with the communities of the Tambo valley, the Company is currently deploying its successful labor program ""Forge Your Future"" (Forjando Futuro) to train 700 people from the Islay Province in 2019. After training, the participants will be eligible to apply for one of the estimated 9,000 jobs (3,600 direct and 5,400 indirect) required during the Tia Maria construction phase. We believe that the initiation of construction activities for Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process with no emissions released into the atmosphere. The project will use seawater, transporting it more than 25 kilometers to an altitude of 1,000 meters above sea level. The construction of the desalinization plant requires an investment of approximately $95 million. Los Chancas—Apurimac: This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates indicate the presence of 545 million tons of mineralized material with a copper content of 0.59%, molybdenum content of 0.04% and 0.039 grams of gold per ton, as well as 181 million tons of mineralized leachable material with a total copper content of 0.357%. Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to annually produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum. The estimated capital investment is $2,800 million and is expected to be in operation in 2025. In 2018, we continued with the development of social and environmental improvements for the local communities. We plan to complete the environmental impact assessment in 2020. Michiquillay Project—Cajamarca: On June 12, 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract and made an initial payment of $12.5 million for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. The Company has created a multidisciplinary management team to plan the development of this project. As part of this plan, the Company has established contact with the local authorities and communities in order to promote programs for the sustainable development of the area. In February 2019, the Company began preliminary social and technical work in the area of the project. 80 Table of Contents Michiquillay is a world class mining project with estimated mineralized material of 1,150 million tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.63%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years, at a competitive cash-cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2025, with Michiquillay becoming one of Peru´s largest copper mines. The project will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the national, regional and local governments. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, leachable material and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $7.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as ""current average prices."" Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt's Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2018: 2018 2017 2016 Average 2018 - 2016 Copper ($ per pound) $ 2.93 $ 2.80 $ 2.20 $ 2.64 Molybdenum ($ per pound) $ 11.94 $ 8.21 $ 6.42 $ 8.88 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore 81 Table of Contents reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see ""Assets impairment"" below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices), for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 ""Properties—Ore reserves."" Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 9 ""Asset Retirement Obligation"" to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in ""Provisionally Priced Sales"" under this Item 7). Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. 82 Table of Contents If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company's operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 ""Income Taxes"" to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 ""Income Taxes"" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the TCJA""). The Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. In 2017, the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for income tax effects of the TCJA in accordance with SAB 118. For further information, see Note 7 ""Income Taxes"", of our consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, reflective of what we believe is the lower level of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.9 to 4.0 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the 83 Table of Contents remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value.

This brings the total recorded effect of the 2017 U.S. tax teform on the Company's financial statements for 2017 and 2018 to a non-cash tax provision of $816.8 million. 87 Table of Contents For additional information regarding the impacts of the TCJA and the adoption of SAB 118 see Note 7 ""Income taxes"" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Equity earnings of affiliate In 2018, 2017 and 2016 we have recognized $12.3 million, $23.1 million and $23.9 million, respectively, of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2018 was $5.2 million, compared to $3.9 million in 2017, and $2.3 million in 2016. It increased in 2018 and 2017 by $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively. These changes were the result of higher earnings at our Peruvian operations in both years. Income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2018 was $1,543.0 million, compared to $728.5 million in 2017 and $776.5 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 net income was mainly due to higher sales and lower taxes as the 2017 financial results included the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million recorded in 2017 as a result of the U.S. income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to SCC decreased in 2017 due to this adjustment. This was partially offset by higher sales and cost reductions achieved in electricity (–8.0%), tires (–9.4%), and other cost elements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018. Cash Flow: The following table shows the cash flow for the three year period ended December 31, 2018 (in millions): Variance 2018 2017 2016 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,235.1 $ 1,976.6 $ 923.1 $ 258.5 $ 1,053.5 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,296.2 ) $ (1,019.0 ) $ (452.0 ) $ (277.2 ) $ (567.0 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,083.4 ) $ (456.1 ) $ (210.7 ) $ (627.3 ) $ (245.4 ) 92 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities: The 2018, 2017 and 2016 change in net cash from operating activities include (in millions): Variance 2018 2017 2016 2018 - 2017 2017 - 2016 Net income $ 1,548.2 $ 732.4 $ 778.8 $ 815.8 $ (46.4 ) Depreciation, amortization and depletion 674.3 671.1 647.1 3.2 24.0 Provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes (51.5 ) 641.5 (117.0 ) (693.0 ) 758.5 Loss (gain) on foreign currency transaction effect 17.3 24.9 (8.9 ) (7.6 ) 33.8 Other adjustments to net income 23.1 (3.4 ) 16.9 26.5 (20.3 ) Operating assets and liabilities 23.7 (89.9 ) (393.8 ) 113.6 303.9 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net cash provided from operating activities $ 2,235.1 $ 1,976.6 $ 923.1 $ 258.5 $ 1,053.5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Significant items added to (deducted from) net income to arrive at operating cash flow include depreciation, amortization and depletion, deferred tax amounts and changes in operating assets and liabilities. In 2017, we recorded a non-cash tax charge of $785.9 million related to the U.S. tax law change enacted in December 2017. 2018: Net income was $1,548.2 million, approximately 69% of the net cash provided from operating activities. A net increase in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flow by $23.7 million and included: • $117.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. • $68.3 million decrease in trade accounts receivable. • $(190.8) million of net increase in inventory, which included $(207.1) million of higher leaching inventory, $(20.7) million of higher finished goods and $(14.0) million of higher supplies inventories for our operations, partially offset by $51.2 million of lower metals in process inventory. • $28.4 million decrease in other operating assets and liabilities. 2017: Net income was $732.4 million, approximately 37% of the net cash provided from operating activities. A net increase in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flow by $89.9 million and included: • $(298.7) million increase in accounts receivable. • $(201.9) million of net increase in inventory, which included $(180.4) million of higher leaching inventory, $(26.8) million of higher supplies inventories for our operations and $(76.3) million of higher metals in process, partially offset by $81.6 million of lower finished goods inventory. • $139.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which included $75.6 million of higher accounts payable, $51.5 million of higher accrued workers' participation and $12.4 million of higher other liabilities. • $271.2 million decrease in other operating assets and liabilities, which included principally $163.9 million of lower prepaid taxes, mainly due to the use of tax credits from previous years. 2016: Net income was $778.8 million, approximately 84% of the net operating cash flow. An increase in operating assets and liabilities reduced operating cash flow by $393.8 million and included: • $(143.3) million increase in accounts receivable. 93 Table of Contents • $(207.9) million increase in inventory which includes $(122.3) million of higher leachable material inventory and $(43.1) million of metals in process, $(26.3) million of higher finished goods and $(16.2) million of higher supplies inventory. • $(42.6) million of net changes in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other operating assets. Net cash used in investing activities: 2018: Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 included $1,121.4 million for capital investments. These included $347.4 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $774.0 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item on page 74. The 2018 investing activities also include net purchases of short-term investments of $163.3 million. 2017: Net cash used for investing activities in 2017 included $1,023.5 million for capital investments. These included $338.1 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $685.4 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item on page 74. The 2017 investing activities also include net sales of short-term investments of $1.0 million. 2016: Net cash used for investing activities in 2016 included $1,118.5 million for capital investments. These included $577.5 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $541.0 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item on page 74. The 2016 investing activities also include net sales of short-term investments of $552.1 million, and a repayment of $111.2 million received from a related party. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities: 2018: Net cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $1,083.4 million and included a dividend distribution of $1,082.3 million. 2017: Net cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $456.1 million and included a dividend distribution of $456.1 million. 2016: Net cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $210.7 million and included: • A dividend distribution of $139.3 million. • The repurchase of 2.9 million of our common shares at a cost of $71.7 million. Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2018 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. As of December 31, 2018, $97.6 million of the Company's total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1,058.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. At December 31, 2016, Minera Mexico determined that it had $470.5 million in earnings available for dividends to the United States. These earnings had not been remitted, but U.S. federal income tax, net of foreign tax credit was recognized in 2016 resulting in an increase in tax of $45.7 million. At December 31, 2017, Minera Mexico had determined that it had 94 Table of Contents earnings available for dividends to the United States of $555.5 million. The 2017 U.S. tax reform introduced a one-time transition tax that is based upon the Company's total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (""E&P"") estimated to be $8.9 billion, the majority of which was previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes were provided. Upon enactment of the 2017 U.S. tax reform, the Company calculated and recorded a provisional tax amount of $181.1 million as a reasonable estimate for the one-time transition tax that was fully offset by foreign tax credits. During 2018, the Company determined that this amount should be reduced by $28 million and finalized its transition tax at $153.1 million, which was fully offset by foreign tax credits. Earnings of the Company's Peruvian branch are not subject to transition taxes since they are taxed in the United States on a current basis. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors (""BOD"") authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2018, we have purchased 119.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.9 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—SCC common stock repurchase plan."" Dividend: On January 24, 2019, the BOD authorized a dividend of $0.40 per share paid on February 26, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 12, 2019. In addition, as part of the settlement of claims brought on behalf of the Company and its shareholders against Grupo Mexico, AMC and certain current and former directors (together with Grupo Mexico and AMC, the ""Defendants"") a dividend of $0.44428 per share was payable on February 21,2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019, other than the Defendants. The settlement dividend, totaling $36.5 million is an obligation of Grupo Mexico and AMC and therefore, have been funded by them. In addition Grupo Mexico and AMC paid $13.5 million of legal fees. For more information, please see ""Litigation matters—Corporate operations"" in Note 12 ""Commitments and Contingencies"" of our consolidated financial statements. FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2018 was $5,960.1 million, compared to $5,957.1 million at December 31, 2017, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par of $91.1 million and $94.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.89%. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 47.4% at December 31, 2018, compared to 49.2% at December 31, 2017. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 42.6% at December 31, 2018, compared to 44.4% at December 31, 2017. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading ""Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation"" below. 95 Table of Contents Please see Note 10 ""Financing"" for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption ""Capital Investment Program"" under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018: Payments due by Period Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 6,051.1 $ — $ 400.0 $ — $ 300.0 $ — $ 5,351.1 Interest on debt 6,900.8 356.5 341.3 334.9 333.3 324.5 5,210.3 Uncertain tax position(a) 214.5 — — — — — — Workers' participation 206.6 206.6 — — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 30.8 3.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 16.3 Asset retirement obligation 217.7 — — — — — 217.7 Purchase obligations: Commitments to purchase energy 3,127.8 218.2 220.5 220.5 227.5 227.5 2,013.6 Capital investment projects 343.1 328.1 15.0 — — — — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 17,092.4 $ 1,112.9 $ 979.4 $ 558.1 $ 863.6 $ 554.9 $ 12,809.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)The above table does not include any scheduled payments related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2018, the tax liability recognized by the Company is $214.5 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet. Please refer to Note 7 ""Income Taxes"" of our consolidated financial statements. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $91.0 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2018. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 ""Financing"" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers' participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers' participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch's taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker's salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers' participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. 96 Table of Contents Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 11 ""Benefit Plans"" of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 9 ""Asset Retirement Obligation."" In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (""MW"") with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (""Kallpa""), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, under which Kallpa will supply energy for the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first. Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 12 ""Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments"". Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects, and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine. CYBERSECURITY: Our operations depend upon information technology systems which may be subject to disruption, damage or failure from different sources, including, without limitation, installation of malicious software, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks and defects in design. In recent years, cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We believe that we have implemented appropriate preventative measures to mitigate potential risks by implementing a certified IT service management system with the necessary controls that are frequently reviewed and tested, including a risk matrix that considers all the possible threats with an impact and probability analysis, actions to avoid or mitigate them and the corresponding testing plan. 97 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of ""Operating Cash Cost"" (see page 72) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2018 2017 2016 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 3,409.0 $ 1.81 $ 3,252.8 $ 1.74 $ 3,034.1 $ 1.58 Add: Selling, general and administrative 102.6 0.05 93.1 0.05 94.3 0.05 Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges 13.9 0.01 22.4 0.01 24.4 0.01 Less: Workers' participation (226.1 ) (0.12 ) (196.2 ) (0.11 ) (130.2 ) (0.07 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (384.5 ) (0.20 ) (363.2 ) (0.19 ) (329.9 ) (0.17 ) Royalty charge and other, net (125.0 ) (0.07 ) (150.5 ) (0.08 ) (74.9 ) (0.04 ) Inventory change 114.5 0.06 139.1 0.07 162.0 0.08 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost before by-product revenues $ 2,904.4 $ 1.54 $ 2,797.5 $ 1.49 $ 2,779.8 $ 1.44 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: By-product revenues(1) (1,211.4 ) (0.64 ) (1,030.2 ) (0.55 ) (904.9 ) (0.47 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (56.3 ) (0.03 ) (50.2 ) (0.02 ) (50.7 ) (0.03 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Add: Total by-product revenues (1,267.7 ) (0.67 ) (1,080.4 ) (0.57 ) (955.6 ) (0.50 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Cash Cost net of by-product revenues 1,636.7 0.87 1,717.1 0.92 1,824.2 0.95 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,886.8 1,874.5 1,924.7 (1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following: 2018 2017 2016 $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound $ millions $ per pound Molybdenum $ (509.9 ) $ (0.27 ) $ (353.4 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (268.1 ) $ (0.14 ) Silver (244.5 ) (0.13 ) (254.9 ) (0.14 ) (246.3 ) (0.13 ) Zinc (229.5 ) (0.12 ) (221.6 ) (0.12 ) (189.3 ) (0.10 ) Sulfuric Acid (111.3 ) (0.06 ) (71.9 ) (0.04 ) (87.6 ) (0.04 ) Gold (53.1 ) (0.03 ) (61.7 ) (0.03 ) (50.6 ) (0.02 ) Other (63.1 ) (0.03 ) (66.7 ) (0.03 ) (63.0 ) (0.04 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ (1,211.4 ) $ (0.64 ) $ (1,030.2 ) $ (0.55 ) $ (904.9 ) $ (0.47 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 141 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties. 98 Table of Contents Net debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: 2018 2017 Total debt $ 5,960.1 $ 5,957.1 Cash and cash equivalents (844.6 ) (1,004.8 ) Short-term investments (213.8 ) (50.5 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net debt 4,901.7 4,901.8 Net capitalization: Net debt 4,901.7 4,901.8 Equity 6,612.9 6,149.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net capitalization $ 11,514.5 $ 11,051.2 Net debt/net capitalization(*) 42.6 % 44.4 % (*)Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to ""Metal Prices"" in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales. Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value 99 Table of Contents of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2018, are provided in the table below: 2018 2017 2016 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 2.5 % 1.5 % 3.2 % Initial exchange rate 3.245 3.360 3.413 Closing exchange rate 3.379 3.245 3.360 Appreciation/(devaluation) (4.1 )% 3.4 % 1.6 % Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 4.8 % 6.8 % 3.4 % Initial exchange rate 19.735 20.664 17.207 Closing exchange rate 19.683 19.735 20.664 Appreciation/(devaluation) 0.3 % 4.5 % (20.1 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2018, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ 16.0 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ (19.5 ) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 15.5 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (19.0 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2018.

1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Combined Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. Effective April 1, 2005, Southern Copper Corporation acquired substantially all of the outstanding common stock of Minera Mexico. The acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control. Under such accounting, the financial statements of SCC and Minera Mexico are combined on a historical cost basis for all the periods presented since they were under the indirect common control of Grupo Mexico during such periods. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us, including our Minera Mexico subsidiary, on a consolidated or combined basis for all periods. Our combined financial results may not be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition of Minera Mexico taken place at the beginning of the periods presented and do not purport to be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See “Cautionary Statements.” OVERVIEW Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, such as molybdenum, zinc, silver, lead and gold, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sales prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to improve profitability. We believe we achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. A number of events and results highlight our Company’s 2007 year. Net sales were $6,085.7 million an 11.5% increase over 2006, additionally, net earnings were $2,216.4 million, an increase of 8.8% over 2006, both sales and net earnings are the highest in the Company history. These increases were achieved while three of our Mexican properties, Cananea, San Martin and Taxco, were on strike from July 30 through the end of the year. We estimate that these strikes cost the Company 178.4 million pounds of copper and 25.6 million pounds of zinc, and reduced 2007 operating income by $487.5 million. Since January 11, 2008 the Cananea mine is open and is preparing to gradually resume normal operations in the near future. The mine was reopened based on a ruling by the labor authorities who declared the strike illegal. Subsequently, the Cananea union obtained an injunction from a federal judge preventing the Company from firing workers who do not return to work immediately, the same judge did explicitly safeguard the rights of any worker who wished to return to work at the mine and the right of the Company to conduct operations in the ordinary course of business. The ruling declaring the illegality of the Cananea strike was challenged before a federal judge who upheld the union’s case on February 14, 2008. The Company will appeal this unfavorable ruling. The Company expects that it will take about three months to return to full production at Cananea. 78 Earnings and sales in 2007 increased because of higher average metal prices for most of our products, copper was 4.2% to 5.9% higher in 2007, depending on whether it was priced on the COMEX or LME market, the molybdenum price was 22.7% higher and silver was 16% higher. Of our other significant by-products only zinc prices were lower in 2007 and, in that case, by 1.3%. The Cananea strike resulted in a decrease in copper, zinc and silver sales volumes. However, during this year there was an increase in the volume of molybdenum sales. Molybdenum production and sales volume increased in 2007 due to higher grades at our Peruvian mines and from an increase in production from the La Caridad mine, which suffered strike losses in 2006. Another factor effecting the improvement in 2007 sales and net income was the impact of the derivative metal contracts which reduced net sales and operating income in 2006 by $276.1 million and increased net sales and operating income by $10.9 million in 2007. During 2007 we announced a modification to our capital investment program to prioritize major investments in Peru. These investments include the Tia Maria SX/EW copper project in Arequipa, Peru, expansions of the Toquepala and Cuajone concentrators and the expansion of the smelter and refinery in Ilo, Peru. We estimate that these investments will have a capital cost of $2,108 million and increase our annual copper production by 270,000 tons in 2011. Feasibility studies indicate a resource of 638 million tons of mineralized material at Tia Maria with an average copper grade of 0.39%. We discuss below several matters that our management believes are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) our “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (ii) metals prices, (iii) our acquisition of Minera Mexico, (iv) our business segments and (v) the effects of inflation and other local currency issues. Since our inception, we have principally maintained operations in Peru. However, in recent years, we have refocused our strategies to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure. In 2003, we acquired exploration properties in Chile, which are being evaluated for potential exploitation and in 2005 we acquired Minera Mexico, with substantial mining operation in Mexico. Please see “Minera Mexico Acquisition.” Operating Cash Costs An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (including depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated combined statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (including depreciation, amortization and depletion); plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges; less by-products revenue and sales premiums, depreciation, amortization and depletion, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us. In our calculation of operating cash cost per 79 pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products, principally molybdenum, zinc and silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in silver and zinc, has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. We exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature, the royalty charge and in periods prior to 2006 the portion of our mine stripping costs that we capitalized. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2007. We present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by-product revenues. 2007 2006 2005 (dollars per pound) Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased $ (0.167 ) $ 0.159 $ 0.030 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased (without by-product revenue) $ 1.401 $ 1.283 $ 1.009 The decrease in the cash costs per pound of copper produced and purchased (including by-product revenue) in 2007 is mainly attributable to higher market price and volume of molybdenum in 2007. The credit for molybdenum sales amounted to $0.849 per pound, $0.420 per pound and $0.617 per pound, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The credit to the cost for zinc sales amounted to $0.337 per pound, $0.374 per pound and $0.126 per pound in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The credit to operating cash cost for the by-product revenue in 2007 reduced cash cost by $1.568 per pound, an increase in benefit of $0.444 per pound over 2006. The improved benefit is almost entirely due to molybdenum revenue, which accounted for $0.429 per pound of the improvement. The reason for the added benefit from molybdenum revenues in 2007 is attributable to both higher sales volume and higher sales price. Volumes improved because of better grades at our Peruvian mines and higher production, an increase of 8.1 million pounds from La Caridad in Mexico, which had significant strike activity in 2006. Molybdenum prices were 22.7% higher in 2007. The credit to operating cash cost in 2006 improved over 2005 by $0.145 per pound and was principally caused by improvements in the sales price of zinc and silver, reduced somewhat by a decrease in the sales price of molybdenum. The cash cost without by-product revenue increased in 2007 principally as a result of the following factors, higher production cost (mainly power, water, labor and repair costs) which increased our cash cost by $0.158, higher freight and treatment charges due to the sale of concentrates which increased cost by $0.065 and also an increase of $0.031 in unit cost due to strikes at some of our Mexican operations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the purchase of outside metal, which reduced cost by $0.118. The cash cost without by-product revenue increased in 2006 as a result of cost increases. The increasingly higher copper prices in 2006 increased our computation 80 of cash cost, as we include in our calculation the cost of purchased metal. The higher value and thus the higher cost of copper in 2006 increased our cash cost by $0.240 in 2006. Significant strike activity at some of our Mexican properties required us to purchase larger quantities of third party copper in 2006. Also the cost of fuel products, electricity and other supplies increased in 2006. Additionally, our operating cash costs increased in 2006 as a result of the EITF consensus, which we adopted on January 1, 2006 and is described below under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Capitalized Mine Stripping Costs.” If we had applied this consensus in 2005 our per pound operating cash cost would have increased by $0.023. Metals Prices The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to speculative activities. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2008 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver – per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 7.6 $ 19.5 $ 1.4 $ 8.6 Minera Mexico Acquisition In April, 2005, we acquired Minera Mexico from a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico, our controlling stockholder. At the time of the acquisition Minera Mexico was the largest mining company in Mexico and the eleventh largest copper producer in the world on a stand-alone basis. We exchanged 67.2 million newly-issued shares of our common stock for the outstanding shares of Minera Mexico’s direct majority stockholder, and Minera Mexico became our 99.1% owned subsidiary. As a part of this transaction, on March 1, 2005, we paid a special transaction dividend of $100 million to all of our stockholders. Upon completion of the merger, Grupo Mexico increased its indirect beneficial ownership of our capital stock from approximately 54.2% to approximately 75.1%. In October 2005, in another transaction we acquired 6.4 million shares of Minera Mexico from Grupo Mexico for $30.3 million. This increased our holdings in Minera Mexico to 99.95%. With this acquisition, based on the then current data, we increased our total copper reserves by over 100% and increased our annual copper production by approximately 80%. Business Segments Company management views Southern Copper as having three operating segments and 81 manages on the basis of these segments. The significant increase in the price of molybdenum over the past three years has had an important impact on the Company’s earnings. Nevertheless, the Company continues to manage its operations on the basis of three copper segments. These segments are our Peruvian operations, our Mexican open-pit operations and our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Cananea mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 20 of our Consolidated Combined Financial Statements. Inflation and Devaluation of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 3.9 % 1.1 % 1.5 % Nuevo sol/dollar (appreciation)/devaluation rate (6.3 )% (6.8 )% 4.5 % Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.8 % 4.1 % 3.3 % Peso/dollar (appreciation)/devaluation rate (0.1 )% 1.5 % (4.9 )% Capital Expansion Program We made capital expenditures of $315.7 million, $455.8 million and $470.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and we expect to make capital expenditures, of approximately $530.0 million in 2008. In general, the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to contribute to further vertical integration of our operations by increasing the capacity for production of refined metal products. The Company expects to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. 82 The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Projects Ilo smelter modernization $ 21.0 $ 160.9 $ 234.6 Cuajone ball mill 10.0 0.4 — Toquepala crushing, conveying system for leach material 2.0 3.3 32.8 Toquepala copper filter — — 2.2 Tailings disposal - Quebrada Honda dam 13.8 2.5 — Cuajone leaching pad 1.4 2.4 — PLS dams at Huanuquera 10.5 15.6 9.1 La Francisca leaching dam — — 7.5 La Caridad tailings dam - internal dikes 2.1 3.4 — Metallurgical laboratory - La Caridad 1.8 — — La Caridad gas handling system 12.2 4.7 — La Caridad acid plant upgrade — 1.0 4.9 La Caridad Vertical lime kiln 2.0 0.5 — PLS dams and leaching system Cananea 4.1 0.8 — Cananea SX/EW plant III 0.2 1.9 — Cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material Phases II and III 21.5 7.2 — Nueva Rosita coke furnaces — 3.5 7.5 San Martin underground shaft — 2.6 1.0 La Caridad tailings dam growth - Concentrator 1.9 — — Santa Barbara Segovedad II mine expansion and conveyor and main substation 3.7 0.8 — Total project expenditures 108.2 211.5 299.6 Replacement capital expenditures: Mexico 139.0 176.1 127.8 Peru 68.5 68.2 43.2 Total replacement expenditures 207.5 244.3 171.0 Total capital expenditures $ 315.7 $ 455.8 $ 470.6 Set forth below are descriptions of some of our current projects and expected capital expenditures. Ilo Smelter Modernization: This project was completed in January 2007 and has allowed our Company to increase sulfur capture over the 92% requirement established in our agreement with the Peruvian government. The new smelter maintains production at current levels. The nominal and design capacity for the new Isasmelt furnace was reached in less than 45 days; compared with other smelting furnaces using this technology, the start-up of the Ilo smelter was achieved in the shortest time. The average sulfur capture in 2007 was 95%. Performance tests are pending completion with the two major contractors. These are expected to be completed in the first quarter 2008. The facility is currently operating at full capacity and we expect to smelt 1.1 million tons of concentrates in 2008. The total cost of this project was $ 570.4 million. Toquepala Leach Dump Project: This project at Toquepala, which includes a crushing, conveying and spreading system at the leach dumps, was completed by year end 2007. The conveying system is operating and has positioned 42.5 million tons of waste material to build the ramp and has placed 28.5 million tons of leachable material. Total expended 83 on this project through December 31, 2007 was $80.7 million and it is estimated that $0.4 million will be needed to finalize this project. Cananea SX/EW Plant: This project is intended to increase Cananea’s production of copper cathodes with a new SX/EW plant, (SX/EW III) with an annual capacity of 33,000 tons. The plant would produce copper cathodes of ASTM grade 1 or LME grade A. The project includes the installation of storage for deliverables required for operation of the plant and the installation of an emergency power plant and a fire protection system. Due to labor problem at Cananea in 2007, this project has been temporarily put on hold until we satisfactorily resolve these issues. Gas Handling System: This project is intended to improve gas capture efficiency and reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions to the atmosphere by the converters and reactor at La Caridad copper smelter. Cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material: This project includes the installation of a crushing system and bands for leach material including a movable stacker with a capacity of 15 million tons of crushing material. We are currently in the third phase of the project. This phase includes 5,500 meters of band transporters and the construction of a 500 meters tunnel to move the material to the leaching area. Other Expenditures: Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project will increase the height of the existing Quebrada Honda Dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills. The procurement of the main equipment, with long fabrication lead-time continues and part of the material has been received. Construction of the main civil works and some access roads for the main and lateral dams has been completed and our operations personnel are working on an additional access road. The first stage of this project will be under development until 2012. The total cost of this project is estimated to be $66.0 million, with $16.4 million expended through December 31, 2007. The dam project at Huanaquera includes the construction of sedimentation, PLS and storm water retention dams for the Toquepala leaching facility. The project is at the administrative close out stage; all equipment was installed and is operative. Total spending on this project through December 31, 2007 was $36.6 million and it is estimated that $0.5 million will be needed to complete the project. A pre-feasibility study for Los Chancas, a copper-molybdenum property in the southern part of Peru was completed and is being evaluated in order to determine our next steps for this project. Also, we are in the process of formulating the necessary program and timeframe to develop our Mexican properties at El Arco in Baja California and Angangueo in Michoacan. Potential Projects: We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return, environmental needs, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. We have defined three “generations” of capital projects: First generation: Projects that we are planning. This generation includes the development of five projects in Peru (1) the Tia Maria SX/EW copper project, (2) the Toquepala concentrator expansion, (3) the Cuajone concentrator expansion, (4) the Ilo smelter expansion, and (5) the Ilo copper refinery expansion, with a total investment of $2,108 million. This investment would permit us to 84 increase our copper production by 270,000 tons per year by 2011, which represents 39% of the current production level. This new investment program replaces the investment program previously approved for our Mexican operations, which included a SX/EW III plant, concentrator expansion and molybdenum circuit at Cananea, the Buena Vista mine, the new Cananea concentrator, and the Guaymas smelter and refinery. These projects with a total investment of $2,256 million have been temporarily put on hold. Feasibility studies for the Tia Maria project were finished with indicative resources of 638 million tons of mineralized material with an average copper grade of 0.39%. The Company is conducting a bidding process for basic and detailed engineering as well as preparing to purchase major equipment and select construction management. The Company expects to invest $65 million in this project during 2008. When completed at the end of 2010, the new operating unit will produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year. Second generation: Projects that are attractive but will require significant additional evaluation. This generation includes three greenfield projects: El Arco, Angangueo and Los Chancas exploration properties. We believe that these properties could add 306,000 tons of annual copper production, in concentrate and SX/EW copper. The Company’s Board of Directors will be evaluating the investment in these projects in line with their expected returns, the metal market price performance and the operating and capital costs. Third generation: This generation includes the Cananea, Sonora and Guaymas projects put on hold by our Board of Directors as result of the strikes in 2007 at some of our Mexican units: the Cananea SX/EW III, the Cananea concentrator expansion, the Cananea molybdenum circuit, the Buena Vista mine, the new Cananea concentrator, and the Guaymas smelter and refinery. The above information about potential projects are estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated combined financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 85 assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For purposes of our long-term planning, we use metal price assumptions of $1.20 per pound for copper and $9.0 per pound for molybdenum. Prior to 2007, we used $0.90 per pound and $5.00 per pound for copper and molybdenum, respectively. Metal prices over the last ten years and the continued positive outlook for these metals have led us to reappraise our view of prices. These prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term. Ore reserves based on these prices are the basis for our internal planning, including the preparation of the mine plans for our mines. Our management uses these price assumptions, as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserves information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated according to Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $2.66 per pound for copper and $28.99 per pound for molybdenum, both current average prices as of December 31, 2007. The current average per pound prices for copper and molybdenum were $2.02 and $24.31, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and $1.26 and $17.82, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. This includes amortization of intangible assets and mine development, and for years prior to 2006 the amount of mine stripping that was capitalized and units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping. Leachable Material: At one of our Mexican mines, we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process (leachable material), which is collected in leach dumps. The amortization of the capitalized cost is determined based on the depletion period of the leach dumps, which is estimated to be five years. If we were to have expensed all capitalized leaching costs associated with this mining operation as incurred, net operating cost would have decreased by $10.1 million for the year 2007 and increased $19.3 million and $68.0 million for the years 2006, and 2005. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. We further discuss our Asset Retirement Obligation in Note 10 to our consolidated combined financial statements included herein. 86 Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customers are given the option to select a monthly average LME or COMEX price (as is the case for sales of copper products) or the molybdenum oxide proprietary market price estimate of Platt’s Metals Week (as is the case for sales of molybdenum products), generally ranging between one and three months subsequent to shipment. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward copper prices based on LME or COMEX prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. Deferred Taxes: In preparing our consolidated combined financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we estimate the actual amount currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $1.80 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $12.00 per pound, along with near-term price forecast, for 2008 through 2010, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. Should estimates of future copper and molybdenum prices decrease significantly, impairments could result. Provisionally Priced Sales The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: 87 Year Ended December 31, Provisionally Priced Sales 2007 2006 2005 Copper Millions of pounds 165.9 169.9 163.7 Priced at (per pound) $ 3.03 $ 2.87 $ 2.04 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 4.7 7.3 6.1 Priced at (per pound) $ 32.38 $ 24.50 $ 25.00 Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Provisional Sales Adjustments 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Copper $ (42.0 ) $ (47.3 ) $ 7.9 Molybdenum — (11.5 ) (39.2 ) Total $ (42.0 ) $ (58.8 ) $ (31.3 ) During the month of January 2008, the market price of copper and molybdenum increased. The effect of these changes on 2007 sales settling in January 2008 was an increase of $3.3 million in sales. Additionally, forward prices for copper as of January 31, 2008 also increased, the effect of this increase on 2007 open sales settling after January 2008 would be an increase of $33.2 million in sales.

Segment Sales Information The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2007 2006 2005 Peruvian operations 863.4 860.9 825.3 Mexican open-pit 512.0 594.8 768.8 Mexican IMMSA unit 30.9 36.4 93.1 Intersegment elimination (75.8 ) (105.9 ) (147.2 ) Total copper sales 1,330.5 1,386.2 1,540.0 Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver — million ounces) 2007 2006 2005 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 21.9 20.6 23.4 Zinc-refined and in concentrate (1) 40.3 49.6 — Silver 4.9 5.6 4.2 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 14.0 5.0 8.8 Zinc-refined and in concentrate (1) — 15.5 108.9 Silver 3.6 4.5 7.2 IMMSA unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 250.6 273.1 288.7 Silver 10.7 12.0 11.5 Intersegment elimination Zinc (39.1 ) (57.1 ) (103.4 ) Silver (0.9 ) (2.3 ) (3.1 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 35.9 25.6 32.2 Zinc-refined and in concentrate 251.8 281.1 294.2 Silver 18.3 19.8 19.8 (1) Through 2006, the Mexican open-pit operations purchased zinc products from IMMSA for resale to its customers. This practice was discontinued in 2006 and IMMSA’s zinc sales were either to their customers or to the Peruvian segment, who in turn resold to their customers. 89 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006. Net sales Our sales in 2007 were $6,085.7 million, compared with $5,460.2 million in 2006, an increase of $625.5 million or 11.5%. The increase was attributable to higher market prices for most of our products. Copper was 4.2% to 5.9% higher in 2007, depending on whether it was COMEX or LME market, the molybdenum price was 22.7% higher and silver was 16% higher. Zinc prices decreased by 1.3% in 2007. In addition, molybdenum sales volume increased 40.2% in 2007 due to higher grades at our Peruvian mines and increased production from the La Caridad mine which had strike losses in 2006. 2007 net sales also include a $10.9 million gain on copper derivatives compared with a loss of $276.1 million in 2006. There was, however, a decrease in copper sales volume in 2007 due to a strike at the Cananea mine. Sales volume for copper decreased by 55.7 million pounds in 2007 a decrease of 4% compared with 2006. The impact of this decrease in copper sales volume, as well as a volume decrease in the sale of zinc and silver was a result of the strikes at some of our Mexican operations. However, during this year there was an increase in the volume of molybdenum sales. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products. Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2007 2006 Refined 586.4 835.0 Blister 51.4 43.9 Anode 31.1 29.9 Concentrates 255.9 56.0 SX/EW 190.4 210.9 Rod 215.3 210.5 Total 1,330.5 1,386.2 Mine copper production was 1,305.5 million pounds in 2007, a decrease of 2.2% from 2006. This decrease of 29.7 million pounds included a reduction of 24.6 million pounds at our Mexican operations due to strike related reductions at our Cananea and San Martin mines where strikes began on July 30, 2007 and ran through the end of the year. Additionally, production at our Peruvian mines decreased by 5.1 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grade at the Toquepala mine. The make up of our 2007 copper sales changed significantly from 2006, as we sold about 200 million additional pounds of copper in concentrate form and about 250 million pounds less of refined copper. This change was caused principally by some delays in reaching full capacity at our modernized Ilo smelter. Molybdenum production and sales increased 36.8% and 40.2%, respectively in 2007 when compared to 2006. The increases are principally due to higher grades at our Peruvian mines and from La Caridad mine which lost production in 2006 due to strikes. Mine zinc production amounted to 266.8 million pounds in 2007, a 11.4% decrease from 2006. The decrease of 34.3 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to the strike losses at our Taxco and San Martin mines. Copper made up 69.5% of net sales in 2007 compared with 76.0% in 2006. Sales of by-products in 2007 totaled $1,856.9 million compared with $1,313.1 million in 2006, an increase of 41.4%. The increase is principally attributable to the increase in the 90 volume and sales prices for molybdenum. This increase was partially reduced by lower volume and sales prices for zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a Percentage of Total Net Sales 2007 2006 Molybdenum 17.8 % 10.5 % Zinc 5.9 % 7.1 % Silver 3.8 % 4.1 % Other by-products 3.0 % 2.3 % Total 30.5 % 24.0 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2007 was $2,122.2 million, compared with $2,019.8 million in 2006, an increase of $102.4 million, or 5.1%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to $132.0 million of higher production cost, including, $21.7 million due to higher fuel and power cost, $15.5 million of higher water cost at our Mexican operations due to an increase in the water rate applicable to the mining industry, $14.8 million of higher labor costs, $24.9 million of higher repair costs, and $55.1 million of other operating costs offset by $146.8 million of lower metal purchased from third parties. The increase in cost of sales also includes $32.3 million of higher freight and selling cost mainly due to higher sale of concentrates, $27.1 million of inventory consumption and $39.4 million of higher workers participation. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2007 was $98.0 million, compared with $88.3 million in 2006, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs of $6.4 million and $2.5 million of higher rental equipment and office maintenance cost at our Mexican corporate office. Depreciation, amortization and depletion Depreciation, amortization and depletion was $327.9 in 2007 compared with $275.1 million in 2006, an increase of $52.8 million over 2006. The increase includes additional charges of $24.4 million at our Peruvian operations, of which $21.7 million was for our newly activated Ilo smelter modernization project. Increases in depreciation, amortization and depletion in 2007 at our Mexican operations amounted to $28.5 million. This increase includes $11.4 million of higher amortization of capitalized leach material due to increased amounts capitalized in 2006, $8.9 million of accelerated depreciation of the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos over the remaining mineral located in the open pit after the mine accident and $8.2 million due to the activation of maintenance and replacement equipment. Exploration Exploration expense in 2007 was $40.2 million compared with $22.7 million in 2006, an increase of $17.5 million over 2006. This increase includes $11.8 million at our Peruvian operations, and was principally for the Tia Maria project in the department of Arequipa, where spending increased by $9.2 million. A feasibility study for the project was completed in 2007 and we are planning to begin the project in 2008. Exploration expense at our Mexican operation increased by $5.7 million in 2007 and was principally for the surface drilling activity at Santa Barbara, San Martin and Santa Eulalia. 91 Interest expense Interest expense in 2007 was $123.2 million compared with $113.4 million in 2006, an increase of $9.8 million. Interest expense increased in 2007 principally as a result of an increase in our average debt outstanding. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of our financing program. Capitalized interest Capitalized interest in 2007 was $14.7 million, compared with $27.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $13.2 million. This decrease is largely due to the startup of the Ilo smelter modernization project in early 2007, for which we capitalized $14.0 million less interest in 2007. Interest income Interest income in 2007 was $82.5 million, compared with $50.2 million in 2006, an increase of $32.3 million. Our interest income increased principally as a result of higher interest rates on short term securities and higher invested balances. Loss on debt prepayments Loss on debt prepayments in 2007 was $16.6 million, compared with $1.1 million in 2005, an increase of $15.4 million. Losses in both periods are related to the repurchase of our Mexican Yankee bonds. (Loss) Gain on derivative instruments Loss on derivative instruments in 2007 was $73.7 million, compared with a loss of $11.6 million in 2006. Gain or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in the net sales line and gain or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales line of the consolidated combined statement of earnings. The (loss) gain on derivative instruments in 2007 and 2006 includes $81.0 million and $11.6 million of loss on the embedded derivatives on short-term investment, respectively. Also the 2007 (loss) gain on derivative instruments includes $1.3 million of loss on dual currency notes and gain of $8.6 million in exchange rate derivatives US dollar/Mexican peso. For a further discussion please see Note 3 Short-term Investments and Note 16 Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Combined Financial Statements. Other income (expense) Other income in 2007 was $30.8 million, compared with an expense of $0.3 million in 2006. The increase in income is primarily attributable to $12.4 million of gain on the sale of an inactive Mexican subsidiary, $3.0 million of lower cost of disposal of assets, and $10.5 million of lower miscellaneous expenses. Income taxes Income taxes in 2007 were $1,185.3 million and include $1.153.8 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $31.5 for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2006 were $959.1 million and included $940.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $18.8 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. US income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). 92 The increase of $226.2 million or 23.6% was primarily due to $405.8 million of higher pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 34.7%, compared with 31.9% in 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate is largely due to the incremental U.S. tax on dividend income. The dividend income eliminates in financial consolidation (book income) but it is taxable in the U.S. at the difference between the 35% U.S. statutory rate and the foreign tax credit rate of 28% on the dividend. Minority interest Minority interest in 2007 was $10.2 million compared with $9.3 million in 2006, an increase of $0.9 million or 10.0%. This increase is the result of higher earnings. Net earnings Our net earnings in 2007 were $2,216.4 million, compared with $2,037.6 million in 2006, an increase of $178.8 million or 8.8%. Net earnings increased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2007 vs.2006: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 3,512.9 $ 3,215.4 $ 297.5 9.3 % Operating costs and expenses (1,541.2 ) (1,383.4 ) (157.8 ) 11.4 % Operating income $ 1,971.7 $ 1,832.0 $ 139.7 7.6 % Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2007 were $3,512.9 million, compared with $3,215.4 million in 2006, an increase of $297.5 million. This increase was principally due to increases in the sales price of copper and molybdenum. The LME copper price was 5.9% higher in 2007 (the majority of sales of our Peruvian operations’ copper is priced on LME) and the molybdenum price was 22.7% higher. Additionally in 2007 copper and molybdenum sales volume increased by 2.5 million pounds and 1.3 million pounds, respectively. Net sales in 2007 include a gain on copper derivatives of $5.5 million compared with a loss of $162.3 million in 2006. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2007 were $1,541.2 million, compared with $1,383.4 in 2006, an increase of $157.8 million principally due to higher cost of sales and higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $117.8 million was principally the result of higher labor cost of $26.6 million due to increase in salaries and exchange rate effect, $9.6 million of higher fuel and power cost, $37.4 million of higher freight and selling cost mainly due to the sale of concentrates and $16.8 million of inventory consumption. The increase in depreciation, amortization of depletion of $24.4 million is mainly due to the newly activated Ilo smelter modernization project which represents an additional charge of $21.7 million. Operating income in 2007 was $1,971.7 million, compared with $1,832.0 million in 2006, an increase of $139.7 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. 93 Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 2,225.1 $ 1,987.1 $ 238.0 12.0 % Operating costs and expenses (954.4 ) (1,067.3 ) 112.9 10.6 % Operating income $ 1,270.7 $ 919.8 350.9 38.1 % Net sales from our Mexican open-pit operations in 2007 were $2,225.1 million, compared with $1,987.1 million in 2006, an increase of $238.0 million or 12.0%. This improvement is the result of the higher molybdenum volume, produced and sold in 2007 and the higher sales price for the molybdenum. Sales of molybdenum, produced by our La Caridad mine increased from 5.5 million pounds in 2006 to 13.6 million pounds in 2007. Significant production and sales of molybdenum were lost in 2006 as La Caridad had a lengthy strike in the first half of the year. This increase, from molybdenum sales, was reduced by the decrease in volume of copper sales, due principally to a strike at the Cananea mine. In addition, net sales in 2007 included a gain on copper derivatives of $5.5 million compared with a loss of $113.9 million in 2006. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2007 were $954.4 million compared with $1,067.3 million in 2006, a decrease of $112.9 million or 10.6%. This decrease was principally the result of lower cost of sales net of higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $131.9 million was principally the effect of the Cananea strike, which began on July 30, 2007 and continued through the end of 2007. An increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion of $16.6 million in 2006 was principally due to higher amortization of capitalized leach material due to increased amounts capitalized in 2006. Operating income in 2007 was $1,270.7 million, compared with $919.8 million in 2006, an increase of $350.9 million or 38.1%. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA Unit. Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 680.7 $ 702.5 $ (21.8 ) (3.1 %) Operating costs and expenses (434.3 ) (405.2 ) (29.1 ) 7.2 % Operating income $ 246.4 $ 297.3 $ (50.9 ) (17.1 %) Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2007 were $680.7 million, compared with $702.5 million in 2006, a decrease of $21.8 million or 3.1%. The decrease was principally due to lower sales volume caused by strikes at the Taxco and San Martin mines and lower zinc prices partially offset by higher sales prices in 2007 for copper and silver. Net sales in 2006 include a loss on zinc derivatives of $0.2 million. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $434.3 million in 2007, compared with $405.2 million in 2006, an increase of $29.1 million or 7.2%. This increase was principally the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) and higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $15.8 million, was principally the result of $12.0 million of higher fuel and power cost, $1.7 million of higher water cost due to increase in water rates and $3.2 million of other operating cost. These increases were partially offset by $0.9 million of lower metal purchased from third parties. The increase in depreciation, 94 amortization and depletion of $9.1 million is mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos over the remaining mineral located in the open pit after the mine accident. Operating income in 2007 was $246.4 million, compared with $297.3 million in 2006, a decrease of $50.9 million or 17.1%. The operating income decreased as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated combined statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 to our consolidated combined financial statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005. Net sales Our sales in 2006 were $5,460.2 million, compared with $4,089.1 million in 2005, an increase of $1,371.1 million or 33.5%. The increase was attributable to significant increases in metal prices in 2006, particularly for copper, which rose approximately 83%, zinc and silver, which rose 136.5% and 57.7%, respectively. As a result of a change in our accounting presentation, net sales includes losses on copper derivatives of $276.1 million and $23.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $0.2 million on zinc derivatives in 2006. Sales volumes for copper declined by 153.8 million pounds in 2006 a decrease of 10% compared with 2005. This decrease in copper sales volume, as well as a decrease in the volume of zinc and molybdenum sold, reduced, somewhat, the sales price increase. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products. Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2006 2005 Refined 835.0 817.3 Blister 43.9 110.3 Anode 29.9 — Concentrates 56.0 14.2 SX/EW 210.9 267.4 Rod 210.5 330.8 Total 1,386.2 1,540.0 Mine copper production was 1,335.2 million pounds in 2006, a decrease of 12.2% from 2005. This decrease of 185.8 million pounds included a decrease of 190.5 million pounds from the Mexican open pit operations, 4.9 million pounds in the Mexican underground mines and an increase of 9.6 million pounds from the Peruvian mines. The decrease of 190.5 million pounds in the Mexican open pit mines was principally the result of the 125 day strike at La Caridad mine and 47 days of strike at the Cananea mine. The decrease of 4.9 million pounds in the Mexican underground mines was due to lower ore grades. The increase of 9.6 million pounds in production from the Peruvian mines was principally due to higher ore grade and recovery in the Cuajone mine. Molybdenum production decreased 19.9% from 32.6 million pounds in 2005 to 26.1 million pounds in 2006. This decrease in production includes 3.7 million pounds from La 95 Caridad due to the strike activity and 2.8 million pounds from our Peruvian operations mainly due to lower ore grade and recovery at the Cuajone mine. Mine zinc production amounted to 301.1 million pounds in 2006, a decrease of 15.5 million pounds or 4.9% from 2005. This decrease was the result of lower production at three of IMMSA’s zinc mines. Lower ore grades at Charcas and Santa Barbara and reduced throughput at San Martin were the prime reasons for the lower production. Production increases at two of the other IMMSA mines, Taxco and Santa Eulalia, somewhat reduced the production losses. The decrease in throughput at San Martin was caused by a 77-day strike in the first half of 2006. The increases in throughput at Taxco and Santa Eulalia were caused by increased operating days at Taxco, 15 days were lost due to strike in 2005, and the increase at Santa Eulalia was caused as production ramped up after a prolonged shutdown. Santa Eulalia restarted operations at the end of 2004 after a three-year shutdown. A fire at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery in the first quarter of 2006, reduced refined zinc production in 2006; we were, however, able to sell zinc concentrates on favorable terms until the refinery was fully operational, which occurred by the end of the third quarter of 2006. Copper made up 76.0% of net sales in 2006 compared with 66.4% in 2005. Sales of by-products in 2006 totaled $1,313.1 million compared with $1,373.6 million in 2005, a decrease of 4.4%. The decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the volume and sales prices for molybdenum. The decrease in molybdenum was to a great extent reduced by the improved prices for zinc and silver, which increased by 136.5% and 57.7%, respectively. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a Percentage of Total Net Sales 2006 2005 Molybdenum 10.5 % 22.7 % Zinc 7.1 % 4.9 Silver 4.1 % 3.6 Other by-products 2.3 % 2.4 Total 24.0 % 33.6 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2006 was $2,019.8 million, compared with $1,635.4 million in 2005, an increase of $384.4 million, or 23.5%. The principal element of the cost of sales increase is the higher value of copper purchased in 2006 which increased our cost of sales by $280.6 million over 2005. Cost of sales in 2006 also had an increase of $23.9 million in Peruvian mining royalties and an increase of $52.4 million in workers’ participation. In addition, cost of sales also increased in 2006 due to the requirement of EITF 04-6 which prohibits the capitalization of mine stripping costs at our operating mines. As such, this cost is now included in cost of sales. The practice of capitalizing mine stripping cost in 2005 reduced cost of sales by approximately $35.0 million. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2006 was $88.3 million, compared with $81.1 million in 2005, an increase of $7.2 million, $5.2 million of which was in our Mexican operations. The Mexican increase is principally due to higher labor costs of $4.4 million and higher professional fees of $1.7 million. 96 Depreciation, amortization and depletion Our depreciation, amortization and depletion expense in 2006 was $275.1 million, compared with $277.2 million in 2005, a decrease of $2.1 million. The decrease was due to the change in accounting for mine stripping cost. Depreciation, amortization and depletion in 2005, included amortization of $67.6 million of capitalized mine stripping. A 2006 increase in depreciation related to replacement capital expenditures reduced the impact of the accounting change. Exploration Exploration expense in 2006 was $22.7 million, compared with $24.4 million in 2005, a decrease of $1.7 million. The decrease was principally as a result of $2.3 million of lower drilling activities in our Mexican operations, mainly at La Caridad due to strikes, $1.2 million of higher investment at Coimolache and Tantahuatay projects net of a decrease of $0.7 million in drilling cost at the Tia Maria project in Peru. Interest expense Interest expense in 2006 was $113.4 million compared with $108.9 million in 2005, an increase of $4.5 million. Our currently paid interest expense increased in 2006 principally as a result of an increase in our debt outstanding. However, included in 2005 there was $15.0 million for the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance cost for financings prepaid in such years. With respect to our financing programs reference is made to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of this matter. Capitalized interest Capitalized interest in 2006 was $27.9 million, compared with $22.4 million in 2005, an increase of $5.4 million. This increase is largely due to the Ilo smelter modernization project, on which we capitalized $5.0 million more than in 2005. Interest income Interest income in 2006 was $50.2 million, compared with $30.8 million in 2005, an increase of $19.4 million. Our interest income increased principally as a result of higher interest rates on short term securities and significantly higher invested balances. Loss on debt prepayments Loss on debt prepayments in 2006 was $1.1 million, compared with $10.6 million in 2005, a decrease of $9.5 million. In 2006 and 2005 we paid a premium of $1.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively to repurchase outstanding Yankee bonds. In addition in 2005 we paid a penalty of $2.0 million for the prepayment of $199 million of Peruvian bonds. (Loss)Gain on derivative instruments Loss on derivatives instruments in 2006 was $11.6 million, compared with a gain of $1.2 million in 2005. Gain or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in the net sales line and gain or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales line of the consolidated combined statement of earnings. The loss of $11.6 million in 2006 is a fair value adjustment made on short-term investments made by the Company in 2006. 97 Other income (expense) Other expense in 2006 was $0.3 million, compared with $3.6 million in 2005, a decrease of $3.3 million. The major component of other expenses in 2006 is a provision of $16.1 million for our contribution to the Peruvian regional development fund; this program, requested by the president of Peru, will be used for nutritional, health, education and other social benefits in our areas of activities. This amount is reduced by gains from insurance recoveries of $11.2 million principally from a partial payment for a fire at our zinc refinery in Mexico, at the beginning of 2006, $3.2 million due to a Mexican tax benefit on gas imports, $2.4 million for a prior year tax adjustment and other miscellaneous income in our Mexican operations of $3.3 million. Income taxes Income taxes in 2006 were $959.1 million, compared with $589.7 million in 2005, an increase of $369.4 million and include $940.3 million and $576.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes, $18.8 million and $13.4 million for US Federal and state taxes for 2006 and 2005, respectively. US income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income as well as limitations on use of the alternative minimum tax. The increase of $369.4 million or 62.6% was primarily due to $1,003.7 million of higher pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.9%, compared with 29.4% in 2005. Included in the 2005 tax provision is a refund of $43.4 million received by Minera Mexico for asset-based taxes (minimum income tax) paid in prior years. Without the benefit of this credit the Company’s effective tax rate for the 2005 year would have been to 31.6%. Minority interest Minority interest in 2006 was $9.3 million compared with $12.5 million in 2005, a decrease of $3.2 million or 25.6%. This decrease is the result of the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2005 of a minority holding of shares in our Minera Mexico subsidiary. Net earnings Our net earnings in 2006 were $2,037.6 million, compared with $1,400.1 million in 2005, an increase of $637.5 million or 45.5%. Net earnings increased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2006 vs.2005: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2006 2005 Value % Net sales $ 3,215.4 $ 2,167.7 $ 1,047.7 48.3 % Operating costs and expenses (1,383.4 ) (879.4 ) (504.0 ) 57.3 % Operating income $ 1,832.0 $ 1,288.3 $ 543.7 42.2 % Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2006 were $3,215.4 million, compared with $2,167.7 million in 2005, an increase of $1,047.7 million. This increase was principally due to significant increases in the price of copper and silver. Copper sales volume increased by 35.5 million pounds in 2006 in part as a result of the purchase and resale of copper acquired from our Mexican operations. Net sales in 2006 and 2005 include losses on copper derivatives of $162.3 million and $12.2 million, 98 respectively. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2006 were $1,383.4 million, compared with $879.4 in 2005, an increase of $504.0 million principally due to higher cost of sales. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $491.4 million was principally the result of the higher cost of metals purchased from our Mexican operations of $397.5 million. In addition, cost of sales increased in 2006 due to the adoption of the new accounting rule for mine stripping costs. This practice reduced cost of sales by approximately $35.0 million in 2005. In 2006 such costs are charged to the cost of production. Our cost for workers’ participation increased $53.4 million in 2006. This cost is calculated based on 8% of our Peruvian operations pre-tax earnings and increased as our profits increase. A Peruvian royalty provision which was instituted in June 2004 added $26.9 million to our cost in 2006. Operating income in 2006 was $1,832.0 million, compared with $1,288.3 million in 2005, an increase of $543.7 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2006 2005 Value % Net sales $ 1,987.1 $ 1,758.3 $ 228.8 13.0 % Operating costs and expenses (1,067.3 ) (1,054.2 ) (13.1 ) 1.2 % Operating income $ 919.8 $ 704.1 $ 215.7 30.6 % Net sales from our Mexican open-pit operations in 2006 were $1,987.1 million, compared with $1,758.3 million in 2005, an increase of $228.8 million or 13.0%. The increase in net sales was principally a result of significant increases in the price of copper and silver partially reduced by a decrease in sales volume as a consequence of the strike activity at La Caridad and Cananea mines. Net sales in 2006 and 2005 include losses on copper derivatives of $113.9 million and $11.3 million, respectively. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2006 was $1,067.3 million compared with $1,054.2 million in 2005, an increase of $13.1 million or 1.2%. This increase was principally the result of higher cost of sales net of lower depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $31.2 million was principally the result of higher purchased metal from third parties with a cost of $73.8 million partially offset by a decrease of $31.8 million in workers participation and lower sales expenses of $15.3 million. Our cost for workers’ participation includes an adjustment of $36.3 million in 2005. This cost is calculated based on 10% of pretax earnings and increases as our profits increase. The decrease in depreciation, amortization and depletion of $16.5 million in 2006 was principally due to the amortization of capitalized mine stripping in 2005. Operating income in 2006 was $919.8 million, compared with $704.1 million in 2005, an increase of $215.7 million or 30.6%. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. 99 IMMSA Unit. Change 2006 2005 Value % Net sales $ 702.5 $ 448.7 $ 253.8 56.6 % Operating costs and expenses (405.2 ) (381.9 ) (23.3 ) 6.1 % Operating income $ 297.3 $ 66.8 $ 230.5 345.1 % Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2006 were $702.5 million, compared with $448.7 million in 2005, an increase of $253.8 million or 56.6%. The increase was due to higher sales prices in 2006 for copper, zinc and silver. In addition, an increase in sales volume of copper added to the 2006 sales increase which was reduced by lower zinc and silver sales volumes. Net sales in 2006 include a loss on zinc derivatives of $0.2 million. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $405.2 million in 2006, compared with $381.9 million in 2005, an increase of $23.3 million or 6.1%. This increase was principally the result of increased cost of sales, administrative expenses and depreciation, amortization and depletion. In 2006, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) increased $15.1 million, principally as a result of higher purchased metals from third parties and higher workers participation. Operating income in 2006 was $297.3 million, compared with $66.8 million in 2005, an increase of $230.5 million or 345.1%. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated combined statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 to the financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007. Liquidity Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 2,703.5 $ 2,059.4 $ 1,663.5 Net cash used for investing activities (246.0 ) (725.3 ) (435.9 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,088.3 ) (1,164.4 ) (1,064.4 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided from operating activities was $2,703.5 million, $2,059.4 million and $1,663.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily the result of higher net earnings in both years, which were the result of improved sales prices for most of our metal products and the change in the balances of operating assets and liabilities. Also in 2007, an increase in molybdenum sales volume contributed to the increase in cash flow. In 2007, our earnings were $2,216.4 million, approximately 82.0% of the net operating 100 cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation amortization and depletion of $327.9 million, $81.0 million of realized loss on short-term investments and $66.6 million of deferred income tax, which positively increased operating cash flow and $45.9 million of capitalized leachable material, which lowered our cash flow. Additionally, a decrease in working capital needs increased operating cash flow by $35.7 million. In 2006, our earnings were $2,037.6 million, approximately 98.9% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to, our earnings to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $275.1 million, and $11.6 million of unrealized loss on short term investment, which positively increased operating cash flow and capitalized leachable material of $65.9 million, which lowered our cash flow. Additionally, an increase in working capital reduced operating cash flow by $178.5 million. The working capital increase was the result of an increase of $217.9 million of receivables as a result of higher copper prices, this increase was reduced by a buildup of $80.7 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a key component of which was the increase of $104.3 million in the unpaid provision for workers’ participation, which was paid in the first quarter of 2007. Other increases in working capital amounted to $41.3 million. In 2005, our earnings were $1,400.1 million, approximately 84.2% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to, our earnings to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $277.2 million, which positively increased operating cash flow, and capitalized mine stripping and leachable material of $38.9 million and $77.5 million, respectively, and a deferred tax benefit of $42.3 million, which reduced operating cash flow. Additionally, changes in working capital balances added $110.5 million to our net cash from operating activities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $246.0 million in 2007 compared to $725.3 million in 2006. In 2007, investing activities include $315.7 million of capital expenditures, $217.9 million for the purchase of short-term investments, less $287.4 million received on the redemption of short-term investments. The $315.7 million of capital expenditures, includes $21.0 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $13.8 million for the Toquepala leach dump project, $10.5 million for the PLS dam project and $270.4 million for equipment replacements and upgrades of which $188.6 million was for our Mexican operations. Net cash used for investing activities was $725.3 million in 2006 compared to $435.9 million in 2005. We made capital expenditures of $455.8 million in 2006, including $160.9 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $15.6 million for the Toquepala leach dump project and $279.3 million principally for equipment replacements and upgrades, of which $202.5 million was for our Mexican operations. In addition, the Company made short-term investments of $280.0 million for 2006. Net cash used for investing activities was $435.9 million in 2005. We made capital expenditures in an aggregate amount of $470.6 million in 2005, including $234.6 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $32.8 million for the Toquepala crushing, conveyor system for leachable material, $9.1 million for the Toquepala leach dump project and $194.1 million principally for equipment replacements and upgrades, of which $148.7 million was for our Mexican operations. Cash flow provided by investing activities in 2005 was from the net sale of short-term investments of $45.3 million. 101 Cash Flows from Financing Activities For 2007, cash used for financing activities amounted $2,088.3 million, mainly for a dividend distribution of $2,002.3 million to our shareholders and $7.2 million to our remaining minority interest investors. In 2007, financing activities also include $68.6 million for the repurchase of our Yankee bonds series B and $10.0 million for the amortization of the Mitsui loan. For 2006, cash used for financing activities amounted to $1,164.4 million, mainly for a dividend distribution of $1,509.1 million to our shareholders and $8.3 million to our remaining minority interest investors. In addition, net debt incurred in 2007 was $356.0 million. For 2005, cash used for financing activities amounted to $1,064.4 million. New financings undertaken in 2005 resulted not only in improved terms for our debt but also reduced our debt burden by $158.2 million. In addition, we distributed $853.9 million to our shareholders in 2005 and $5.3 million to our remaining minority interest investors. In October 2005, we purchased an additional 6.4 million shares of Minera Mexico, representing 0.8133% of the outstanding shares, for $30.3 million. Other Liquidity Considerations On January 29, 2008, the Company announced an up to $300 million share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. Under this program the Company may purchase shares from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. On January 24, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $1.40 per share, totaling $412.3 million, to be paid on February 29, 2008 to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2008. Our dividend policy continues to be reviewed at Board of Directors’ meetings, taking into consideration the current intensive capital investment program and expected future cash flow generated from operations. The Company expects that it will meet its cash requirements for 2008 and beyond from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. In December 2006, our Peruvian Branch signed a contract with the Peruvian government committing our Company to make annual contributions for five years to support the regional development of Peru. The contributions are being used for social benefit programs. In 2007, the Company made a contribution of $16.1 million out of 2006 earnings and has charged 2007 earnings $17.9 million for the 2008 contribution. The following three years’ contributions could increase or decrease depending on earnings and copper prices. If the copper price drops below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. In June 2004, the Peruvian Congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies. Under this law, we are subject to a 1% to 3% charge, based on sales, applicable to the value of the concentrates produced. We made a provision of $62.8 million, $67.2 million and $40.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for this charge. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we made payments of $64.0 million, $67.1 million and $47.4 million, respectively, related to this charge. Financing The Company’s total debt at December 31, 2007 was $1,466.4 million compared with $1,545.0 million at December 31, 2006 before the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $16.7 million and $16.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, 102 respectively. The $78.6 million net decrease in total debt during 2007 was due to the repurchase of $68.6 million of Yankee bonds series B and $10.0 million payment on the Mitsui loan. The Company’s ratio of debt to total capitalization was 27.3% at December 31, 2007, compared with 29.3% at December 31, 2006. The $400 million 7.5% notes due 2035 issued in 2006 are in addition to the $600 million of existing 7.5% notes due 2035 that were issued in July 2005. The 2006 financing was issued at a spread of +240 basis points over the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. Comparatively, the financing in July 2005 was issued at a spread of +315 basis points over the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. The notes are rated Baa2 by Moody’s, BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, and BBB- by Fitch. The 2006 financing was issued at a discount of $10.8 million. Additionally, the Company capitalized in “Other assets, net,” on the consolidated balance sheet, $3.2 million of costs associated with the 2006 issuance. Capital Expenditure Programs A discussion of our capital expenditure programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. The Company expects to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Expansion Program” of this section. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments due by Period Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 1,466.4 $ 160.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 1,266.4 Interest on debt 2,286.2 99.6 95.8 95.3 94.6 94.1 1,806.8 FIN No. 48 (a) 154.7 — — — — — — Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,491.0 157.0 157.0 157.0 157.0 157.0 706.0 Contribution to the Peruvian regional development 17.9 17.9 — — — — — Total $ 5,416.2 $ 434.5 $ 262.8 $ 262.3 $ 261.6 $ 261.1 $ 3,779.2 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to FIN No.48 liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2007 the liability recognized by the Company was $154.7 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2007. Please refer to “Note 11—Financing” of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Energia del Sur, S.A. until 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on power costs in 2007, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. 103 Pursuant to our agreement with the Peruvian Government signed on December 28, 2006 we have committed to make annual contributions for five years for the regional development of Peru based on Peruvian Branch earnings after income tax. The following three-year contributions could increase or decrease depending on copper prices. The commitment of the Branch is for a total of 1.25% of its annual earnings, after Peruvian income tax. If the copper price drops below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. For an additional discussion on this matter please see “Regional development contribution” on “Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies” of the Consolidated Combined Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation- Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 79) to GAAP cost of sales in millions of dollars and cents per pound in the table below: 2007 2006 2005 $ million $ per unit $ million $ per unit $ million $ per unit Cost of sales (including depreciation, amortization and depletion)—GAAP $ 2,450.1 $ 1.898 $ 2,294.9 $ 1.668 $ 1,912.6 $ 1.266 Add: Selling, general and administrative expenses 98.0 0.076 88.3 0.064 81.1 0.054 Treatment and refining charges 57.9 0.045 61.0 0.044 34.3 0.023 Less: By-product revenue (1) (2,023.7 ) (1.568 ) (1,547.1 ) (1.124 ) (1,478.0 ) (0.979 ) Depreciation, amortization and depletion (327.9 ) (0.254 ) (275.1 ) (0.200 ) (277.2 ) (0.184 ) Workers’ participation (310.9 ) (0.241 ) (271.5 ) (0.197 ) (219.2 ) (0.145 ) Royalty charge and other, net (128.0 ) (0.099 ) (127.1 ) (0.093 ) (40.8 ) (0.027 ) Inventory change (31.5 ) (0.024 ) (4.4 ) (0.003 ) 33.0 0.022 Operating Cash Cost $ (216.0 ) $ (0.167 ) $ 219.0 $ 0.159 $ 45.8 $ 0.030 Add by-product revenue 2,023.7 1.568 1,547.1 1.124 1,478.0 0.979 Operating Cash Cost, without by-product revenue $ 1,807.7 $ 1.401 $ 1,766.1 $ 1.283 $ 1,523.8 $ 1.009 Total pounds of copper produced and purchased (in millions) 1,291.0 1,375.9 1,510.4 (1) Includes net by-product sales revenue and premiums on sales of refined products. 104 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based upon our indebtedness at December 31, 2007, a change in interest rates of one percent (or 100 basis points) would impact net income and cash flows by $0.6 million annually. We are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency. To manage the volatility related to the risk, we may enter into forward exchange contracts, currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2008 as provided in the table below. Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 7.6 $ 19.5 $ 1.4 $ 8.6 We occasionally use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rate and exchange rate risk exposures. The Company generally does not enter into derivative contracts unless it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposing the Company to market risk. Copper and zinc derivatives: From time to time we enter into derivative instruments to protect a fixed copper, or zinc price for a portion of our metal sales. In 2007 and 2006 we entered into copper collar and swaps contracts to protect a portion of our 2007 and 2006 sales of copper production. Related to the settlement of these copper derivative instruments we recorded a gain of $10.9 million and a loss of $276.1 million in the 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gains and losses were recorded in net sales in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. In the third quarter of 2006 we entered into a zinc swap contract to protect a portion of the sale of zinc concentrates purchased during the recovery from a fire at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery. Related to the settlement of this contract we recorded in 2006, a loss of $0.2 million which was recorded in net sales in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. We did not hold any copper or zinc derivative contracts at the end of December 2007. Transactions under these metal price protection programs are not accounted for as hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in net sales on the consolidated combined statement of earnings. In 2006, the Company changed its accounting classification policy to recognize gains or losses on metal price derivatives in net sales. The Company believes that this income statement classification reflects better the intention of this price protection 105 program. Before 2006, the change in the fair market value of our derivative instruments was accounted for in a separate non-operating income statement line item. Prior-year gains and losses have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation. Gas swaps: In 2006 and 2007 we entered into gas swap contracts to protect part of our gas consumption as follows: 2007 2006 Gas volume (MMBTUs) 900,000 3,650,000 Fixed price 7.5250 4.2668 Gain (loss) (in million) $ (0.9 ) $ 6.3 The gains (losses) obtained were included in the production cost. At December 31, 2007, we did not hold any open gas swap contracts. Exchange rate derivatives, U.S. dollar / Mexican peso contracts: Because more than 85% of our sales collections in Mexico are in US dollars and many of our costs are in Mexican pesos, during 2006 and 2007 we entered into zero-cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting, within a range, against an appreciation of the Mexican peso to the US dollar. In these contracts if the exchange rate settles at or below the barrier, we do not sell US dollars, if the exchange rate settles above the barrier price established in the contract we sell US dollars at the strike price established in the contract. In 2007 and 2006 the exercise of these zero-cost derivative contracts resulted in gains of $8.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which were recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. At December 31, 2007 we held the following exchange rate derivative operations: Notional Amount (millions) Due Date, Weekly expiration during Strike Price (Mexican Pesos/U.S. Dollars) Barrier Price (Mexican Pesos/ U.S. Dollars) $ 2.0 1st Quarter 2008 (*) 11.60 11.28 $ 2.0 1st Quarter 2008 (*) 11.28 10.70 $ 60.0 4th Quarter 2008 11.32 10.60 (*) These operations matured on January 3, 2008 and reported a gain of $0.1 million, which was recorded as unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the consolidated combined statement of earnings at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the above listed exchange rate derivative contracts was a gain of $0.5 million,which was recorded as gain on derivative instruments in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. Each notional amount includes a group of weekly transactions that have the same strike and barrier price. In addition, at December 31, 2007 the Company held the following exchange rate derivative contract: Amount $53.0 million Valuation date $1.0 million weekly, through December 31, 2008 Peso/dollar exchange rate 11.2 pesos = $1.00 106 The above noted contract settles weekly, and if the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate is below 11.20 the counterparty to the contract, in this case Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (“MLCS”), will pay the Company 11.2 million Mexican pesos and the Company will pay MLCS $1.0 million. If the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate is not below 11.20 MLCS will pay the Company 22.4 million Mexican pesos and the Company will pay MLCS $2.0 million. Dual currency notes: In 2007 we invested $560.0 million in dual currency notes which provided an above market interest return subject to a barrier range of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rates. Related to these investments we realized an exchange loss of $1.3 million, which was recorded as a loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. We earned interest of $2.1 million in 2007, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. Interest Rate Swaps: During 2005 the Company entered into short interest rate swap contracts to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk on certain of its floating rate bank obligations. As a result of these positions, the Company recorded a net gain of $1.2 million in 2005. This gain was recorded in loss in derivatives instruments on the consolidated combined statement of earnings. The Company did not hold any interest rate swap contracts during 2007 and 2006 and does not hold any open positions as of December 31, 2007. Short-term investments: Commencing in 2006 the Company began making short-term investments (90 days to 1 year) in leveraged, indexed instruments. The balances of short-term investments were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, Investment 2007 2006 3-month note, issued December 12, 2006, with extensions every 3 months up to a maximum of 12 months, and with an interest rate of 7% established by a pool of Mexican and Peruvian bond issues. $ — $ 100.0 3-month note, issued December 12, 2006, with extensions every 3 months up to a maximum of 13 months and 5 days, with an interest rate of 7% established by a pool of Mexican and Peruvian bond issues. — 100.0 180-day note, maturing June 12, 2007 with an interest rate of 6%, with barrier range of $37.669 and $69.957 of SCC stock price, NYSE symbol PCU. — 40.0 180-day note, maturing June 28, 2007 with an interest rate of 6%, with barrier range of $38.738 and $71.942 of SCC stock price, NYSE symbol PCU. — 20.0 300-day note, maturing December 24, 2007 with an interest rate of 3.6%, with barrier range of $50.00 and $75.00 of SCC stock price, NYSE symbol PCU. — 20.0 Short-term investment in securities issued by public companies with a weighted average interest rate of 5.07%. 117.9 — Total $ 117.9 $ 280.0 107 In addition to the 2006 investments, on January 19, 2007 we invested $100.0 million, in a 3-month note, with extensions every 3 months up to a maximum of 12 months and at an interest rate of 7.25%, established by a pool of Mexican and Peruvian bond issues. This investment was liquidated on October 3, 2007. Short-term investment in securities held as of December 31, 2007 consists of those investments available for sale and are issued by public companies. Each security is independent of the others. Current value of these investments is deemed to approximate fair value. Some of the other investment instruments were indexed to SCC common stock prices while others were leveraged and indexed to certain bond pools. Both types of instruments could have caused the principal of the investment to be reduced if the established ranges were breached. Since the notes were not principal protected, the Company risked losing part or all of the initial investment. These instruments had been deemed to contain embedded derivatives and had been subject to valuation using a binomial model. Related to these short-term investments, the Company recorded losses of $81.0 million and $11.6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The losses on these short-term investments were recorded as loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. Additionally, the Company earned interest of $18.7 million and $9.3 million on these investments in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which were recorded in interest income in the consolidated combined statement of earnings. Impact of New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB published SFAS No. 160 “Non Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” — an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement addresses the reporting of minority interests in the results of the parent and provides direction for the recording of such interests in the financial statements. It also provides guidance for the recording of various transactions related to the minority interests, as well as certain disclosure requirements. SFAS No. 160 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods after December 15, 2008; earlier adoption is prohibited and shall be applied prospectively. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company will adopt this pronouncement on January 1, 2009. The adoption of this statement will cause some changes to our Company’s presentation of financial results and our statement of position. However, these changes are not expected to be of a material nature. In September 2006 the FASB published SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 establishes a common definition of fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 was to be effective for financial statements issued in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. On February 6, 2008, the FASB issued a position paper that partially defers SFAS No. 157 for one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures. For a description of the impact of other new accounting standards, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Impact of new accounting standards,” to our consolidated combined financial statements. 108",2023-12-30 21:07:02.507847
1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operation EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us, including our Minera Mexico subsidiary, on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See “Cautionary Statements.” OVERVIEW Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, such as molybdenum, zinc, silver, lead and gold, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sales prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We believe we endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. Since our inception, we have principally maintained operations in Peru. However, in recent years, we have refocused our strategies to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure. In 2003, we acquired exploration properties in Chile, which are being evaluated for potential exploitation and, in 2005 we acquired Minera Mexico, with substantial mining operations in Mexico. The acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control. The year 2008 was a turbulent time for the world’s economies and it appears to us that this will continue at a minimum through 2009. The sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States led to liquidity issues at the major financial institutions and this spread through most of the industrialized world. These problems began to have a significant effect on our industry in the third quarter of 2008 and continued through the balance of the year as metal prices declined. The LME copper price ended 2007 at $3.03 per pound and averaged $3.62 per pound for the first three quarters of 2008; the copper price in the fourth quarter, however, averaged $1.77 per pound and ended the year at $1.32 per pound. Early in 2009, through mid-February we see copper averaging about $1.49 per pound. These metal prices are being influenced by current economic distress and also by inventory adjustments (draw-downs) by the worlds’ copper consumers. We anticipate that the inventory adjustments will be completed later in 2009 and that demand will rise afterwards. However, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy when this will occur. 77 Table of Contents While we are experiencing a major downturn, it must be remembered that we are in a cyclical industry and have historically operated through these up and down periods. Our Company’s strengths lie in our ore reserves, our low operating costs, our strong cash position of $716.7 million and our low debt level of $1.3 billion, with no significant principal payments until 2015, which we believe will permit us to maintain our profitability and positive cash flow. Nevertheless, we have suspended most of our capital investments in new as well as in expansion projects, as we believe this prudence and business discipline is needed during the current low commodity cycle. By most objective results 2008 was a good year for our Company. Sales of $4.9 billion and net earnings of $1.4 billion were the third highest in our history, and dividend distributions to our shareholders of $1.7 billion were the second highest in our history. Additionally, the average 2008 LME price of copper of $3.16 per pound and the average molybdenum price of $28.42 were the second and third highest average prices, respectively, for these metals. However, the year closed with declining metal prices and resulted in a fourth quarter loss of $124.7 million, the first such loss of our Company since we combined our Peruvian operations with Minera Mexico in 2005. The declining fourth quarter metal prices also created an adjustment to sales to write down provisionally priced sales to the lower realized prices and lower future prices. This occurred as much of our copper, and almost all of our molybdenum sales, take their final price in months subsequent to shipment. Sales value for these provisionally priced shipments are recorded at prices in effect at the time of shipment, so that in a time of decreasing metal prices prior months sales create a negative adjustment to sales. The effect in 2008 of the provisional price adjustment was a reduction in net sales of $403.5 million and an estimated reduction in net earnings of $251.5 million. Net sales for 2008 were $4.9 billion, as compared to $6.1 billion in 2007. The year end drop off in prices and lower volumes caused this decrease. Net earnings for 2008 were $1.4 billion, as compared to $2.2 billion in 2007, this decrease was primarily caused by the decreasing metal prices and lower sales volumes and higher 2008 production cost. In 2008, capital spending and exploration spending totaled $553.6 million, as compared to $356.0 million in 2007. Included in 2008 spending is $118.0 million for the Tia Maria project and $37.7 million for the Toquepala expansion project. In 2008 we distributed $1.7 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders, as compared to $2.0 billion in 2007. In light of the current economic situation we will continue to monitor dividend distributions throughout 2009. Please see our dividend policy under “other liquidity considerations” in this item. In 2008 copper mine production decreased by 227.6 million pounds from prior year, largely as a result of the strike at our Cananea mine. Zinc and silver production, in 2008 also decreased, while molybdenum production increased slightly. Despite these decreases, we exceeded our production objectives at the open pit mines of Toquepala, Cuajone and La Caridad, as well as at the IMMSA underground units of Charcas, Santa Eulalia, Santa Barbara, the coking facility at Nueva Rosita and the La Caridad precious metals plant. A continuing area of concern for our Company is the strike at our Cananea mine, as well as Taxco and San Martin. This strike began in July 2007 and continues into 2009. While positive judicial rulings have been issued a number of times, these have been generally followed by appeals that reversed the previous decisions. Most recently, in December 2008, the Mexican Federal Labor Court ruled in favor of the Company and declared the strike illegal. The union appealed this decision and on January 7, 2009, the judge of the fifth district on labor matters annulled the favorable decision to the Company. We have filed a request for a review of this ruling before an appellate federal court. We will continue to pursue a favorable resolution of the labor 78 Table of Contents stoppage. It is expected that production at Cananea will remain suspended until these labor issues are resolved. We estimate that these strikes have reduced production of copper and zinc in 2008 by 425.6 million pounds and 52.0 million pounds, respectively, and have reduced operating income by approximately $1.1 billion. We are hopeful of resolving these strikes in 2009, but it is difficult to predict with any accuracy when this will occur. We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These include, (i) our “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (ii) metal prices, (iii) business segments, (iv) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (v) our expansion and modernization program and environmental protection program. Operating Cash Costs An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion); plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges and by-products revenue and sales premiums; less workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products, principally molybdenum, zinc, silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in silver and zinc, has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. We exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the royalty charge. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2008. We present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by-product revenues. 79 Table of Contents Positive (negative) Variance (Cents per pound) 2008 2007 2006 2008-2007 2007-2006 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased 34.1 (13.3 ) 15.9 (47.4 ) 29.2 Less: by-products revenue 137.3 151.3 112.4 (14.0 ) 38.9 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased without by-products revenue 171.4 138.0 128.3 (33.4 ) (9.7 ) 2008 against 2007: As seen on the chart above, our cash cost per pound for 2008 when calculated with by-products revenue are costs of 34.1 cents per pound compared with a credit of 13.3 cents per pound in 2007. The decrease in the by-products credit in the 2008 period was largely due to lower molybdenum prices especially in the last quarter of the year. The effect of lower molybdenum prices reduced the by-products credit by approximately 13.7 cents per pound for 2008. Our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, were higher by 33.4 cents per pound in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease of 17.4% in copper production, principally as a result of the Cananea mine strike, which increased cash cost by 18.1 cents and the higher power and fuel cost which increased cash cost by 9.9 cents. 2007 against 2006: Our cash cost per pound for 2007 when calculated with by-products revenue was a credit of 13.3 cents per pound compared with a cost of 15.9 cents per pound in 2006. The increase in the by-products credit in the 2007 period was largely due to higher molybdenum prices and sales volume. The credit for molybdenum sales was 84.9 cents per pound in 2007 as compared to 42.0 cents per pound in 2006. Our cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, were higher by 9.7 cents per pound in 2007 compared to 2006 and this was due to 15.8 cents of higher production cost (mainly labor, power and fuel cost) as well as to 6.5 cents per pound of higher freight due to the sale of concentrates which were partially offset by 11.8 cents per pound of lower purchases of third-party metals. Metals Prices The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to speculative activities. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price 80 Table of Contents sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2009 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 6.0 $ 22.4 $ 1.3 $ 9.7 Business Segments We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Cananea mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines. The Mexican open pit operations produce copper, with significant by-products production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Devaluation of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 6.6 % 3.9 % 1.1 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 4.8 % (6.3 )% (6.8 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 6.5 % 3.8 % 4.1 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 24.5 % (0.1 %) 1.5 % Capital Expansion Program We made capital expenditures of $516.7 million, $315.7 million and $455.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and we expect to make capital expenditures, of 81 Table of Contents approximately $392.6 million in 2009. In general, the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to increase production and/or decrease costs. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Projects Ilo smelter modernization (including marine trestle) $ 6.6 $ 21.0 $ 160.9 Tia Maria — Arequipa —Peru 118.0 Cuajone ball mill 1.4 10.0 0.4 Toquepala crushing, conveying system for leach material 0.1 2.0 3.3 Toquepala concentrator expansion 37.7 — — Cuajone concentrador expansion 18.2 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 21.7 13.8 2.5 Cuajone leaching pad — 1.4 2.4 PLS dams at Huanaquera 0.3 10.5 15.6 Pilares Mine 20.0 — — La Caridad tailings dam - internal dikes 2.1 2.1 3.4 Metallurgical laboratory — La Caridad 1.5 1.8 — La Caridad gas handling system 11.3 12.2 4.7 La Caridad by-products treatment plant 6.9 — — La Caridad Vertical lime kiln 7.1 2.0 0.5 PLS dams and leaching system Cananea — 4.1 0.8 Cananea SX/EW plant III — 0.2 1.9 Cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material Phases II and III 13.6 21.5 7.2 La Caridad crusher high efficiency system 2.8 — — Nueva Rosita coke furnaces — — 3.5 San Martin underground shaft — — 2.6 La Caridad tailings dam growth — Concentrator — 1.9 — El Arco feasibility study, land a water 3.9 — — Santa Barbara Segovedad II mine expansion and conveyor and main substation 6.5 3.7 0.8 Total project expenditures 279.7 108.2 210.5 Replacement capital expenditures: Mexico 138.4 139.0 177.1 Peru 98.5 68.5 68.2 Total replacement expenditures 236.9 _207.5 245.3 Total capital expenditures $ 516.6 $ 315.7 $ 455.8 In light of the current business environment we have suspended most of our capital investments in new as well as in expansion projects. Set forth below are descriptions of some of our current expected capital expenditures. The Company expects to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. Peruvian Operations: Tia Maria: The Tia Maria project, which includes the Tia Maria and the La Tapada deposits, is located in the department of Arequipa on the southern coast of Peru and is part of a copper porphyritic system. 82 Table of Contents The feasibility studies in 2008 for Tia Maria show 193 million tons of mineralized material with 0.302% copper content. For La Tapada, the estimated mineralized resources show 445 million tons of mineralized material, with 0.434% copper content. In 2008 the Company completed the basic engineering and started the detailed engineering studies for the project. The environmental impact assessment is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we have spent $118.0 million for the Tia Maria project. We are currently evaluating whether to put on hold or to slow down the spending in light of current market conditions and capital equipment cost. We estimate spending $140.0 million on this project during 2009, which includes funds necessary to complete environmental and engineering studies, as well as spending previously committed. When completed the new operating unit is expected to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year. Toquepala concentrator expansion: As of December 31, 2008, we have spent $37.7 million for the Toquepala expansion. This project is designed to increase annual Toquepala copper production by approximately 100,000 tons per year. We completed the feasibility study. The basic engineering is almost completed and detailed engineering will be started. The environmental impact assessment is also underway and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect to spend $113.0 million in 2009, to complete studies and for previously committed orders. After that we will put on hold making any new additional capital spending commitments for this project. Cuajone concentrator expansion: For the Cuajone concentrator expansion project we have completed the feasibility study and will only continue at this point with the environmental impact assessment. However, any further spending is being deferred pending improvement in economic conditions. Ilo Smelter Modernization: This project was completed in January 2007 and has allowed our Company to increase sulfur capture over the 92% requirement established in our agreement with the Peruvian government. A complimentary project to the Ilo smelter modernization is the construction of a marine trestle to offload the sulfuric acid produced at the smelter directly to offshore ships. At December 31, 2008 this project reached 66% completion and is expected to be completed in June 2009. The completed project is expected to ease congestion in our Ilo area. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project will increase the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills. The procurement of the main equipment and materials was finished. Construction of the main civil and mechanical and electrical installations for the main and lateral dams has been completed. The lateral dam was commissioned in December 2008 and the main dam will be commissioned in February 2009. Progress on the first stage of this project is 99.7% complete and the balance is expected to be completed by March 2009. The total cost of this project is estimated to be $66.0 million, with $38.0 million expended through December 31, 2008. Mexican operations: The Company will continue with the environmental projects at its mining and metallurgical facilities. At La Caridad metallurgical complex the gas handling and dust and effluent treatment projects are being completed. These projects are at 93% and 70% of completion, respectively, and have a combined budget of $9.0 million for 2009. The Agua Prieta lime plant modernization project, in the Mexican state of Sonora, is moving forward to completion. When finished, this project is expected to reduce the annual lime cost of our Mexican operations by approximately $9.0 million. The capital budget for this project is $14.0 million. 83 Table of Contents Other Expenditures: Regarding our copper deposit projects at Los Chancas in Peru, El Arco, Pilares and the underground polymetallic mine in Angangueo in Mexico, we will continue to evaluate them, but will defer making a final decision until economic conditions improve. All capital projects related to Cananea are on hold pending resolution of the labor situation. These include the new SX-EW plant, the concentrator expansion and a molybdenum circuit at this operation. Potential Projects: We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return, environmental needs, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital expenditures have been stopped or are under review. We believe that this discipline is required in response to the weakened commodity prices and economic uncertainties. The above information are estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For purposes of our long-term production planning, we use metal price assumptions of $1.20 per pound for copper and $9.00 per pound for molybdenum. Prior to 2007, we used $0.90 per pound and $5.00 per pound for copper and molybdenum, respectively. These prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term. Ore reserves based on these prices are the basis for our internal planning, including the preparation of the mine plans for our mines. Our management uses these 84 Table of Contents price assumptions, as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $3.15 per pound for copper and $28.02 per pound for molybdenum, both current average prices as of December 31, 2008. The current average per pound prices for copper and molybdenum were $2.66 and $28.99, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and $2.02 and $24.31, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Leachable Material: At one of our Mexican mines, we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process (leachable material), which is collected in leach dumps. The amortization of the capitalized cost is determined based on the depletion period of the leach dumps, which is estimated to be five years. If we were to have expensed all capitalized leaching costs associated with this mining operation as incurred, net operating cost would have decreased by $57.6 million and $10.1 million for the years 2008 and 2007, respectively, and increased $19.3 million for the year 2006. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. We further discuss our Asset Retirement Obligation in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, generally ranging between one and six months subsequent to shipment. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details under “Provisionally prices sales” below). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business 85 Table of Contents operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix power prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates, currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar conversion rates. Gains and losses related to copper and zinc hedges are included in net sales, gain and losses related to power costs are included in cost of sales, all other gains and losses on derivative contracts are included in “Gain (loss) on derivative contracts” in the consolidated statement of earnings. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” guidance to record these liabilities (See Note 8 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 86 Table of Contents Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $1.80 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $12.00 per pound, along with near-term price forecast, for 2008 through 2010, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. Due to the illegal work stoppage we have performed an impairment analysis on the assets at the Cananea mine. We continue to provide periodic maintenance to the assets and expect to begin operations at this mine in the near future. We have determined through our impairment analysis that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2008. Should estimates of future copper and molybdenum prices decrease significantly, impairments could result. Provisionally Priced Sales The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Provisionally Priced Sales 2008 2007 2006 Copper Millions of pounds 141.0 165.9 169.9 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 1.39 $ 3.03 $ 2.87 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 6.3 4.7 7.3 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 9.50 $ 32.38 $ 24.50 Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Provisional Sales Adjustments 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Copper $ (44.2 ) $ (42.0 ) $ (47.3 ) Molybdenum (53.1 ) — (11.5 ) Total $ (97.3 ) $ (42.0 ) $ (58.8 ) During the month of January 2009, the market price of copper increased and the price of molybdenum decreased slightly. The effect of these changes on 2008 sales settling in January 2009 was an increase of $1.1 million in sales. Additionally, forward prices for copper as of January 31, 2009 also increased, the effect of this increase on 2008 open sales settling after January 2009 would be an increase of $3.2 million in sales. Results of Operations The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. 87 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Statement of Earnings Data 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 4,850.8 $ 6,085.7 $ 5,460.2 Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) (2,182.2 ) (2,122.2 ) (2,019.8 ) Selling, general and administrative (102.4 ) (98.0 ) (88.3 ) Depreciation, amortization and depletion (327.3 ) (327.9 ) (275.1 ) Exploration (37.0 ) (40.2 ) (22.7 ) Operating income 2,201.9 3,497.4 3,054.3 Interest expense (105.9 ) (123.2 ) (113.4 ) Interest capitalized 6.8 14.7 27.9 Interest income 48.4 82.5 50.2 Loss on debt prepayments — (16.6 ) (1.1 ) Loss on derivative instruments (74.6 ) (73.7 ) (11.6 ) Other income (expense) 17.2 30.8 (0.3 ) Income taxes (679.3 ) (1,185.3 ) (959.1 ) Minority interest (7.9 ) (10.2 ) (9.3 ) Net earnings $ 1,406.6 $ 2,216.4 $ 2,037.6 The table below outlines the average published market metals prices for our metals for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Average Market Metals Prices Year Ended December 31, % Change 2008 2007 2006 2007 to 2008 2006 to 2007 Copper price ($ per pound - LME) $ 3.16 $ 3.23 $ 3.05 (2.2 )% 5.9 % Copper price ($ per pound - COMEX) $ 3.13 $ 3.22 $ 3.09 (2.8 )% 4.2 % Molybdenum price ($ per pound)(1) $ 28.42 $ 29.91 $ 24.38 (5.0 )% 22.7 % Zinc price ($ per pound - LME) $ 0.85 $ 1.47 $ 1.49 (42.2 )% (1.3 )% Silver price ($ per ounce - COMEX) $ 14.97 $ 13.39 $ 11.54 11.8 % 16.0 % (1) Platt’s Metals Week Dealer Oxide. Segment Sales Information The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008: 88 Table of Contents Copper Sales (million pounds) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Peruvian operations 793.7 863.4 860.9 Mexican open-pit 321.9 512.0 594.8 Mexican IMMSA unit 35.5 30.9 36.4 Intersegment elimination (36.6 ) (75.8 ) (105.9 ) Total copper sales 1,114.5 1,330.5 1,386.2 By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver - million ounces) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 20.3 21.9 20.6 Zinc-refined and in concentrate (1) 18.6 40.3 49.6 Silver 3.7 4.9 5.6 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 16.1 14.0 5.0 Zinc-refined and in concentrate (1) — — 15.5 Silver 4.5 3.6 4.5 IMMSA unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 220.7 250.6 273.1 Silver 8.9 10.7 12.0 Intersegment elimination Zinc (18.2 ) (39.1 ) (57.1 ) Silver (2.1 ) (0.9 ) (2.3 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 36.4 35.9 25.6 Zinc-refined and in concentrate 221.1 251.8 281.1 Silver 15.0 18.3 19.8 (1) Through 2006, the Mexican open-pit operations purchased zinc products from IMMSA for resale to its customers. This practice was discontinued in 2006 and IMMSA’s zinc sales were either to their customers or to the Peruvian segment, who in turn resold to their customers. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007. Net sales Net sales in 2008 were $4,850.8 million, compared with $6,085.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $1,234.9 million or 20.3%. The decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in sales volume of 16.2% and a decline in metal prices. Copper sales volume decreased 16.2% in 2008 due to a 17.4% decrease in production principally due to the ongoing strike at the Cananea mine and lower ore grades at the Toquepala and La Caridad mines. In 2007, we also lost sales volume at Cananea due to a strike but to a lesser extent than in 2008. In addition, zinc and silver sales volume decreased as result of the strikes at some of our other Mexican operations. The decline in metal prices began late in the third quarter of the year and continued through the fourth quarter. Copper was 2.8% and 2.2% lower in 2008, depending on 89 Table of Contents whether it was COMEX or LME market, the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower and zinc prices were 42.2% lower. As a result of the decreasing copper and molybdenum prices, adjustments for provisionally priced sales reduced 2008 net sales by approximately $403.5 million. In 2008, approximately 60% of our copper and almost all of our molybdenum were sold under contracts that based the final sales price on months subsequent to shipment. Net sales in 2008 also include a $137.0 million gain on copper derivatives compared with a gain of $10.9 million in 2007. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products. Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2008 2007 Refined 657.4 586.4 Blister 21.9 51.4 Anode 22.0 31.1 Concentrates and other 101.4 255.9 SX/EW 142.2 190.4 Rod 169.6 215.3 Total 1,114.5 1,330.5 Mine copper production was 1,077.9 million pounds in 2008, a decrease of 17.4% from 2007. This decrease of 227.6 million pounds included a reduction of 204.1 million pounds at our Mexican operations mainly due to strike related reductions at our Cananea and San Martin mines which were on strike almost all of 2008 and lower ore grade and PLS processed at the La Caridad mine. Additionally, production at our Peruvian mines decreased by 23.5 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades and recoveries at the Toquepala mine. Molybdenum production and sales volume increased 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively in 2008 when compared to 2007. The increases are principally due to higher grades from La Caridad mine. Mine zinc production amounted to 235.7 million pounds in 2008, an 11.6% decrease from 2007. The decrease of 31.1 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to the strike losses at our Taxco and San Martin mines. Copper made up 69.2% of net sales in 2008 compared with 69.5% in 2007. Sales of by-products in 2008 totaled $1,495.9 million compared with $1,856.9 million in 2007, a decrease of 19.4%. The decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the sales prices for molybdenum as well as decrease in sales volume and prices for zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a Percentage of Total Net Sales 2008 2007 Molybdenum 16.5 % 17.8 % Zinc 4.0 % 6.0 % Silver 4.3 % 3.8 % Other by-products 6.0 % 2.9 % Total 30.8 % 30.5 % 90 Table of Contents Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2008 was $2,182.2 million, compared with $2,122.2 million in 2007, an increase of $60.0 million, or 2.8%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to 1) $152.7 million of higher production cost, including, $113.2 million of higher fuel and power cost and $37.1 million of higher labor costs mainly in our Peruvian operations due to new labor agreements and the appreciation of the nuevo sol, and 2) $56.5 million of higher concentrates purchased from third parties to cover the loss of production at our Mexican mines. These increases were partially offset by 1) $98.8 million of lower workers participation, 2) $13.2 million of lower mining royalties both due to the decrease in revenues as a result of lower metal prices and 3) $29.8 million of gain in currency translation mainly due to the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was $102.4 million, compared with $98.0 million in 2007, an increase of $4.4 million. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs of $1.8 million, $1.5 million of higher legal and consulting services and $1.2 million of higher software and license fees. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2008 was $37.0 million and included $20.4 million in Peru (including Chile) and $16.6 million in Mexico, compared with $40.2 million in 2007, of which $25.4 million was in Peru (including Chile) and $14.8 million in Mexico. Exploration expense at Tia Maria decreased from $8.9 million in 2007 to $4.6 million in 2008. The spending in 2007 was high because it included the Tia Maria feasibility study. In 2008, Tia Maria entered the development stage as an economic project, please see “Capital expansion program”, under this Item 7. Also in Peru, exploration spending on the Los Chancas project increased to $3.2 million in 2008 from $0.9 million in 2007, as we increased our spending on drilling and field work in 2008. Additionally, in 2007 we spent $7.0 million on other feasibility studies, compared to $3.2 million in 2008. Exploration spending in Mexico was $16.6 million in 2008, as compared to $14.8 in 2007. Major spending in 2008 included drilling and field work at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines in our IMMSA unit. Interest expense Interest expense in 2008 was $105.9 million compared with $123.2 million in 2007, a decrease of $17.3 million. Interest expense decreased in 2008 as a result of a decrease in our average debt outstanding, mainly due to the payment in April 2008 of $150 million of Series A of our Yankee bonds. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of our financing program. Capitalized interest Capitalized interest in 2008 was $6.8 million, compared with $14.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $7.9 million. This decrease is mainly due to the startup of the Ilo smelter modernization project in early 2007 and the start up of the new PLS dump project at Toquepala in late 2007. Capitalized interest for these two projects was $3.2 million lower in 2008. Capitalized interest in our Mexican operations decreased by $4.7 million in 2008 due to payment of our Yankee bonds. 91 Table of Contents Interest income Interest income in 2008 was $48.4 million, compared with $82.5 million in 2007, a decrease of $34.1 million. Our interest income decreased principally as a result of lower interest rates on cash investments in 2008 and lower average invested balances. Loss on debt prepayments Loss on debt prepayments in 2007 was $16.6 million. This loss was related to the repurchase of $68.6 million of Series B of our Yankee bonds. We did not prepay any debt in 2008. Loss on derivative instruments Loss on derivative instruments in 2008 was $74.6 million compared with $73.7 million in 2007. Gain or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gain or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. The loss on derivative instruments in 2008 and 2007 includes the following (in millions): 2008 2007 Gain (loss) on US dollar/ Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives $ (74.6 ) $ 8.6 Loss on embedded derivatives in short-term investments — (81.0 ) Loss on dual currency notes — (1.3 ) Total $ (74.6 ) $ (73.7 ) The $74.6 million loss on US dollar/ Mexican peso exchange rate in 2008 was result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso late in 2008. The Mexican peso devalued 24.5% in 2008 compared to an appreciation of 0.1% in 2007. In 2007 we held short-term investment instruments which were indexed to SCC common stock prices and other instruments leveraged and indexed to certain bond pools. These instruments were not principal protected and were deemed to contain embedded derivatives. Related to these embedded derivatives we lost $81.0 million in 2007 which was recorded as “Loss on derivative instruments” in the consolidated statement of earnings. The total amount of these investment instruments were liquidated during the course of 2007. We did not hold these types of instruments in 2008. For a further discussion please see Note 16 Derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) in 2008 was $17.2 million compared to $30.8 million in 2007. The decrease of $13.6 million in income was attributable to $8.8 million of lower income in our Peruvian operations and $4.8 million in our Mexican operations. The decrease in income in our Peruvian operation was mainly due to a $10.3 million loss on a mark to market valuation of short-term investments, net of an increase in income of $1.5 million on miscellaneous sales. The decrease in income in our Mexican operation was mainly due to a loss of $12.4 million on the sale of investments, net of $3.9 million of tax recoveries, other than income tax. Also 2008 includes a $2.6 million loss on asset disposals. 92 Table of Contents Income taxes Income taxes in 2008 were $679.3 million and include $724.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $45.0 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2007 were $1,185.3 million and include $1.153.9 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $31.5 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. US income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The decrease of $506.1 million or 42.7% was primarily due to $1,318.1 million of lower pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.5%, compared with 34.8% in 2007. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions due to a settlement with the IRS. Please see note 8 “Income Taxes” for further discussion of the settlement. Minority interest Minority interest in 2008 was $7.9 million compared with $10.2 million in 2007, a decrease of $2.3 million or 23.1%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings in our Peruvian operations. Net earnings Our net earnings in 2008 were $1,406.6 million, compared with $2,216.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $809.8 million or 36.5%. Net earnings decreased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2008 vs.2007: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 2,943.2 $ 3,512.9 $ (569.7 ) (16.2 ) Operating costs and expenses (1,418.4 ) (1,541.2 ) 122.8 (8.0 ) Operating income $ 1,524.8 $ 1,971.7 $ (446.9 ) (22.7 ) Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2008 were $2,943.2 million, compared with $3,512.9 million in 2007, a decrease of $569.7 million. This decrease was principally due to the price decline of copper and molybdenum late in 2008. While the LME copper price was 2.2% lower in 2008 (the majority of copper sales of our Peruvian operation are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower. The reduction to sales was magnified, since the prices of the metals dropped sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008. This occurred since much of our sales of copper and molybdenum take final pricing in months subsequent to shipment. The effect of provisional price adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2008 reduced sales by $330.3 million. Additionally, in 2008 copper, molybdenum and silver sales volume decreased by 69.7 million pounds, 1.6 million pounds and 1.2 million ounces, respectively. The decrease in copper sales was mainly due to lower rod sales by our trading subsidiary. These sales were less due to less material being available from our Mexican operations as a result of the Cananea strike. The decrease in molybdenum sales volume was due to lower production mainly from the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grade. Net sales in 2008 also include a gain on copper derivatives of $91.8 million compared with a gain of $5.5 million in 2007. 93 Table of Contents Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2008 were $1,418.4 million, compared with $1,541.2 in 2007, a decrease of $122.8 million principally due to lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,243.1 million in 2008, compared with $1,365.2 million in 2007. The decrease of $122.1 million was principally the result of 1) $104.6 million of lower copper concentrates purchased from third parties, 2) $153.0 million of lower metal purchased from our Mexican operations due to the strike at Cananea, 3) $17.1 million of lower workers participation due to lower earnings, 4) $16.5 million of lower sales expenses due to changes in product mix sales and 5) $8.9 million of lower mining royalties due to lower metal prices. These decreases were partially offset by $192.6 million of higher production cost mainly due to $118.0 million of higher fuel and power cost due to higher market prices and $62.3 million of higher labor cost due to new labor agreements and the appreciation of the Peruvian nuevo sol during part of the year. Operating income in 2008 was $1,524.8 million, compared with $1,971.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $446.9 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 1,583.6 $ 2,225.1 $ (641.5 ) 28.8 Operating costs and expenses (949.5 ) (954.4 ) 4.9 0.5 Operating income $ 634.1 $ 1,270.7 $ (636.6 ) 50.1 Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2008 were $1,583.6 million, compared with $2,225.1 million in 2007, a decrease of $641.5 million or 28.8%. This decrease is result of lower metal prices and lower copper sales volume, mainly refined and rod, due to the loss of production as a result of the ongoing strike activity at the Cananea mine. While the COMEX copper price was 2.8% lower in 2008 (the majority of copper sales of our Mexican operations are priced on COMEX) and the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower, the effect of provisional price adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2008 reduced sales by $76.4 million. Partially offsetting this reduction, net sales in 2008 included a gain on copper derivatives of $45.2 million compared with a gain of $5.5 million in 2007. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2008 was $949.5 million compared with $954.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $4.9 million. This decrease was the result of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2008 of $7.7 million, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher depreciation amortization and depletion due to higher amortization of capitalized leach material and $0.9 million of higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was principally the effect of the ongoing strike at the Cananea mine and is explained by 1) $56.4 million of lower production cost, 2) $62.0 million of lower workers’ participation, 3) $17.6 million of lower inventory consumption partially offset by 4) $99.0 million of higher metals purchased from third parties, 5) $28.0 million of continuing cost at Cananea mine and 6) $14.0 million of severance payments. Operating income in 2008 was $634.1 million, compared with $1,270.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $636.6 million or 50.1%. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. 94 Table of Contents IMMSA Unit. Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 525.1 $ 680.7 $ (155.6 ) 22.9 Operating costs and expenses (511.7 ) (434.3 ) (77.4 ) 17.8 Operating income $ 13.4 $ 246.4 $ (233.0 ) 94.6 Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2008 were $525.1 million, compared with $680.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $155.6 million or 22.9%. The decrease in 2008 was principally due to lower sales volume caused by strikes at the Taxco and San Martin mines and lower zinc prices. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $511.7 million in 2008, compared with $434.3 million in 2007, an increase of $77.4 million or 17.8%. This increase was principally the result of $84.7 million of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) partially offset by $4.9 million of lower depreciation, amortization and depletion, the effect of the accelerated depreciation taken in 2007 on the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos as a result of the mine accident and $3.7 million of lower selling, general and administrative expenses due to lower consultant and support services. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was principally the result of 1) $82.4 million of higher metal purchased from third parties to partially cover the production loss due to the strikes, 2) $38.0 million of loss in currency translation due to the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, 3) $9.1 million of higher fuel and power cost due to increased market prices, 4) $8.6 million of higher drilling and field work at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines and 5) $11.4 million of contractor services for operations due to higher production of coal and coke in Nueva Rosita south pit. These increases were partially offset by 1) $21.2 million of lower workers participation, 2) $15.0 million for an insurance reimbursement for the zinc refinery fire in 2007, 3) $13.1 million of use of inventory and 4) $8.1 million of lower tolling cost due to termination of the contract in May 2008. Operating income in 2008 was $13.4 million, compared with $246.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $233.0 million or 94.6%. The operating income decreased as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006. Net sales Our sales in 2007 were $6,085.7 million, compared with $5,460.2 million in 2006, an increase of $625.5 million or 11.5%. The increase was attributable to higher market prices for most of our products. Copper was 4.2% to 5.9% higher in 2007, depending on whether it was COMEX or LME market, the molybdenum price was 22.7% higher and silver was 16% higher. Zinc prices decreased by 1.3% in 2007. In addition, molybdenum sales volume increased 40.2% in 2007 due to higher grades at our Peruvian mines and increased production from the La Caridad mine which had strike losses in 2006. 2007 net sales 95 Table of Contents also include a $10.9 million gain on copper derivatives compared with a loss of $276.1 million in 2006. There was, however, a decrease in copper sales volume in 2007 due to a strike at the Cananea mine. Sales volume for copper decreased by 55.7 million pounds in 2007 a decrease of 4% compared with 2006. The impact of this decrease in copper sales volume, as well as a volume decrease in the sale of zinc and silver was a result of the strikes at some of our Mexican operations. However, during this year there was an increase in the volume of molybdenum sales. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products. Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2007 2006 Refined 586.4 835.0 Blister 51.4 43.9 Anode 31.1 29.9 Concentrates 255.9 56.0 SX/EW 190.4 210.9 Rod 215.3 210.5 Total 1,330.5 1,386.2 Mine copper production was 1,305.5 million pounds in 2007, a decrease of 2.2% from 2006. This decrease of 29.7 million pounds included a reduction of 24.6 million pounds at our Mexican operations due to strike related reductions at our Cananea and San Martin mines where strikes began on July 30, 2007 and ran through the end of the year. Additionally, production at our Peruvian mines decreased by 5.1 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grade at the Toquepala mine. The make up of our 2007 copper sales changed significantly from 2006, as we sold about 200 million additional pounds of copper in concentrate form and about 250 million pounds less of refined copper. This change was caused principally by some delays in reaching full capacity at our modernized Ilo smelter. Molybdenum production and sales increased 36.8% and 40.2%, respectively in 2007 when compared to 2006. The increases are principally due to higher grades at our Peruvian mines and from La Caridad mine which lost production in 2006 due to strikes. Mine zinc production amounted to 266.8 million pounds in 2007, a 11.4% decrease from 2006. The decrease of 34.3 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to the strike losses at our Taxco and San Martin mines. Copper made up 69.5% of net sales in 2007 compared with 76.0% in 2006. Sales of by-products in 2007 totaled $1,856.9 million compared with $1,313.1 million in 2006, an increase of 41.4%. The increase is principally attributable to the increase in the volume and sales prices for molybdenum. This increase was partially reduced by lower volume and sales prices for zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a Percentage of Total Net Sales 2007 2006 Molybdenum 17.8 % 10.5 % Zinc 6.0 % 7.1 % Silver 3.8 % 4.1 % Other by-products 2.9 % 2.3 % Total 30.5 % 24.0 % 96 Table of Contents Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2007 was $2,122.2 million, compared with $2,019.8 million in 2006, an increase of $102.4 million, or 5.1%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to $132.0 million of higher production cost, including, $21.7 million due to higher fuel and power cost, $15.5 million of higher water cost at our Mexican operations due to an increase in the water rate applicable to the mining industry, $14.8 million of higher labor costs, $24.9 million of higher repair costs, and $55.1 million of other operating costs offset by $146.8 million of lower metal purchased from third parties. The increase in cost of sales also includes $32.3 million of higher freight and selling cost mainly due to higher sale of concentrates, $27.1 million of inventory consumption and $39.4 million of higher workers participation. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2007 was $98.0 million, compared with $88.3 million in 2006, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs of $6.4 million and $2.5 million of higher rental equipment and office maintenance cost at our Mexican corporate office. Depreciation, amortization and depletion Depreciation, amortization and depletion was $327.9 million in 2007 compared with $275.1 million in 2006, an increase of $52.8 million over 2006. The increase includes additional charges of $24.4 million at our Peruvian operations, of which $21.7 million was for our newly activated Ilo smelter modernization project. Increases in depreciation, amortization and depletion in 2007 at our Mexican operations amounted to $28.5 million. This increase includes $11.4 million of higher amortization of capitalized leach material due to increased amounts capitalized in 2006, $8.9 million of accelerated depreciation of the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos over the remaining mineral located in the open pit after the mine accident and $8.2 million due to the activation of maintenance and replacement equipment. Exploration Exploration expense in 2007 was $40.2 million compared with $22.7 million in 2006, an increase of $17.5 million over 2006. This increase includes $11.8 million at our Peruvian operations, and was principally for the Tia Maria project in the department of Arequipa, where spending increased by $9.2 million. A feasibility study for the project was completed in 2007 and we are planning to begin the project in 2008. Exploration expense at our Mexican operation increased by $5.7 million in 2007 and was principally for the surface drilling activity at Santa Barbara, San Martin and Santa Eulalia. Interest expense Interest expense in 2007 was $123.2 million compared with $113.4 million in 2006, an increase of $9.8 million. Interest expense increased in 2007 principally as a result of an increase in our average debt outstanding. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of our financing program. Capitalized interest Capitalized interest in 2007 was $14.7 million, compared with $27.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $13.2 million. This decrease is largely due to the startup of the Ilo 97 Table of Contents smelter modernization project in early 2007, for which we capitalized $14.0 million less interest in 2007. Interest income Interest income in 2007 was $82.5 million, compared with $50.2 million in 2006, an increase of $32.3 million. Our interest income increased principally as a result of higher interest rates on short term securities and higher invested balances. Loss on debt prepayments Loss on debt prepayments in 2007 was $16.6 million, compared with $1.1 million in 2006, an increase of $15.5 million. Losses in both periods are related to the repurchase of our Mexican Yankee bonds. Loss on derivative instruments Loss on derivative instruments in 2007 was $73.7 million, compared with a loss of $11.6 million in 2006. Gain or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in the net sales line and gain or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales line of the consolidated statement of earnings. The loss on derivative instruments in 2007 and 2006 includes $81.0 million and $11.6 million of loss on the embedded derivatives on short-term investment, respectively. Also the 2007 loss on derivative instruments includes $1.3 million of loss on dual currency notes and gain of $8.6 million in exchange rate derivatives US dollar/Mexican peso. For a further discussion please see Note 3 Short-term Investments and Note 16 Derivative Instruments to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (expense) Other income in 2007 was $30.8 million, compared with an expense of $0.3 million in 2006. The increase in income is primarily attributable to $12.4 million of gain on the sale of an inactive Mexican subsidiary, $3.0 million of lower cost of disposal of assets, and $10.5 million of lower miscellaneous expenses. Income taxes Income taxes in 2007 were $1,185.3 million and include $1.153.8 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $31.5 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2006 were $959.1 million and included $940.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $18.8 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. US income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The increase of $226.2 million or 23.6% was primarily due to $405.8 million of higher pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 34.7%, compared with 31.9% in 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate is largely due to the incremental U.S. tax on dividend income. The dividend income eliminates in financial consolidation (book income) but it is taxable in the U.S. at the difference between the 35% U.S. statutory rate and the foreign tax credit rate of 28% on the dividend. 98 Table of Contents Minority interest Minority interest in 2007 was $10.2 million compared with $9.3 million in 2006, an increase of $0.9 million or 10.0%. This increase is the result of higher earnings. Net earnings Our net earnings in 2007 were $2,216.4 million, compared with $2,037.6 million in 2006, an increase of $178.8 million or 8.8%. Net earnings increased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2007 vs.2006: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 3,512.9 $ 3,215.4 $ 297.5 9.3 % Operating costs and expenses (1,541.4 ) (1,383.4 ) (158.0 ) 11.4 % Operating income $ 1,971.5 $ 1,832.0 $ 139.5 7.6 % Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2007 were $3,512.9 million, compared with $3,215.4 million in 2006, an increase of $297.5 million. This increase was principally due to increases in the sales price of copper and molybdenum. The LME copper price was 5.9% higher in 2007 (the majority of sales of our Peruvian operations’ copper is priced on LME) and the molybdenum price was 22.7% higher. Additionally in 2007 copper and molybdenum sales volume increased by 2.5 million pounds and 1.3 million pounds, respectively. Net sales in 2007 include a gain on copper derivatives of $5.5 million compared with a loss of $162.3 million in 2006. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2007 were $1,541.4 million, compared with $1,383.4 in 2006, an increase of $158.0 million principally due to higher cost of sales and higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $117.8 million was principally the result of higher labor cost of $26.6 million due to an increase in salaries and an exchange rate effect, $9.6 million of higher fuel and power cost, $37.4 million of higher freight and selling cost mainly due to the sale of concentrates and $16.8 million of inventory consumption. The increase in depreciation, amortization of depletion of $24.4 million is mainly due to the newly activated Ilo smelter modernization project which represents an additional charge of $21.7 million. Operating income in 2007 was $1,971.5 million, compared with $1,832.0 million in 2006, an increase of $139.5 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 2,225.1 $ 1,987.1 $ 238.0 12.0 % Operating costs and expenses (954.4 ) (1,067.3 ) 112.9 10.6 % Operating income $ 1,270.7 $ 919.8 $ 350.9 38.1 % Net sales from our Mexican open-pit operations in 2007 were $2,225.1 million, compared with $1,987.1 million in 2006, an increase of $238.0 million or 12.0%. This 99 Table of Contents improvement is the result of the higher molybdenum volume, produced and sold in 2007 and the higher sales price for the molybdenum. Sales of molybdenum, produced by our La Caridad mine increased from 5.5 million pounds in 2006 to 13.6 million pounds in 2007. Significant production and sales of molybdenum were lost in 2006 as La Caridad had a lengthy strike in the first half of the year. This increase, from molybdenum sales, was reduced by the decrease in volume of copper sales, due principally to a strike at the Cananea mine. In addition, net sales in 2007 included a gain on copper derivatives of $5.5 million compared with a loss of $113.9 million in 2006. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2007 were $954.4 million compared with $1,067.3 million in 2006, a decrease of $112.9 million or 10.6%. This decrease was principally the result of lower cost of sales net of higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $131.9 million was principally the effect of the Cananea strike, which began on July 30, 2007 and continued through the end of 2007. An increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion of $16.6 million in 2006 was principally due to higher amortization of capitalized leach material due to increased amounts capitalized in 2006. Operating income in 2007 was $1,270.7 million, compared with $919.8 million in 2006, an increase of $350.9 million or 38.1%. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA Unit Change 2007 2006 Value % Net sales $ 680.7 $ 702.5 $ (21.8 ) (3.1 %) Operating costs and expenses (434.3 ) (405.2 ) (29.1 ) 7.2 % Operating income $ 246.4 $ 297.3 $ (50.9 ) (17.1 %) Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2007 were $680.7 million, compared with $702.5 million in 2006, a decrease of $21.8 million or 3.1%. The decrease was principally due to lower sales volume caused by strikes at the Taxco and San Martin mines and lower zinc prices partially offset by higher sales prices in 2007 for copper and silver. Net sales in 2006 include a loss on zinc derivatives of $0.2 million. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $434.3 million in 2007, compared with $405.2 million in 2006, an increase of $29.1 million or 7.2%. This increase was principally the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) and higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) of $15.8 million, was principally the result of $12.0 million of higher fuel and power cost, $1.7 million of higher water cost due to increase in water rates and $3.2 million of other operating cost. These increases were partially offset by $0.9 million of lower metal purchased from third parties. The increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion of $9.1 million is mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos over the remaining mineral located in the open pit after the mine accident. Operating income in 2007 was $246.4 million, compared with $297.3 million in 2006, a decrease of $50.9 million or 17.1%. The operating income decreased as a result of the factors described above. 100 Table of Contents Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008. Liquidity (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 1,720.6 $ 2,703.5 $ 2,059.3 Net cash used for investing activities (410.9 ) (246.0 ) (725.3 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,048.0 ) (2,088.3 ) (1,164.3 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided from operating activities was $1,720.6 million, $2,703.5 million and $2,059.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily the result of lower net earnings as a result of lower sales prices for most of our metal products and a decrease in sales volume. The increase in 2007 was primarily the result of higher net earnings, which was the result of improved sales prices for most of our metal products and the change in the balances of operating assets and liabilities. Also in 2007, an increase in molybdenum sales volume contributed to the increase in cash flow. In 2008, our earnings were $1,406.6 million, approximately 81.8% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to arrive to operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $327.3 million and $56.8 million of unrealized loss on derivative instruments which positively increased operating cash flow and $100.1 million of a deferred income tax benefit, $30.0 million for a gain on the sale of inactive properties in our Mexican operations and $18.1 million of gain on currency translation which lowered our cash flow. Additionally in 2008, a decrease in working capital needs increased operating cash flow by $61.9 million. The contribution from working capital includes (in millions): Accounts receivable $ 330.2 Inventories (3.3 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (164.3 ) Other operating assets and liabilities (100.7 ) Total $ 61.9 The cash flow generated by the reduction in accounts receivable was primarily caused by the sharp decrease in metal prices at the end of 2008. The fourth quarter 2008 price of copper and molybdenum was approximately 46% and 55% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the year-end 2008 price of copper and molybdenum was approximately 55% and 70% lower than the year-end 2007 prices. Accounts payable and 101 Table of Contents accrued liabilities decreased by $164.3 million in 2008, largely as a result of a decrease in workers’ participation and income tax accruals of $107.8 million and $97.8 million, respectively, as a result of lower earnings in 2008. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2008 were a use of cash of $100.7 million which was caused principally by a decrease of $84.5 million in FIN 48 provision, see Note 8 — “Income Taxes”, of our consolidated financial statements. In 2007, our earnings were $2,216.4 million, approximately 82.0% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation amortization and depletion of $327.9 million, $81.0 million of realized loss on short-term investments and $66.6 million of deferred income tax, which positively increased operating cash flow and $45.9 million of capitalized leachable material, which lowered our cash flow. Additionally, a decrease in working capital needs increased operating cash flow by $34.9 million. The 2007 contribution from working capital includes (in millions): Accounts receivable $ 66.2 Inventories (34.6 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (150.3 ) Other operating assets and liabilities 153.6 Total $ 34.9 The cash flow generated by the reduction in accounts receivable was primarily caused by a timing difference in sales. The increase in inventory of $34.6 million was due to a temporary increase of supplies inventory due to the strikes at our Mexican operations partially offset by a decrease in metal inventory due to the decrease in production. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $150.3 million. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2007 was a use of cash of $153.6 million. In 2006, our earnings were $2,037.6 million, approximately 98.9% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to, our earnings to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $275.1 million, and $11.6 million of unrealized loss on short-term investment, which positively increased operating cash flow and capitalized leachable material of $65.9 million, which lowered our cash flow. Additionally, an increase in working capital reduced operating cash flow by $178.5 million. The working capital increase was the result of an increase of $217.9 million of receivables as a result of higher copper prices, this increase was reduced by a buildup of $80.7 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a key component of which was the increase of $104.3 million in the unpaid provision for workers’ participation, which was paid in the first quarter of 2007. Other increases in working capital amounted to $41.3 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $410.9 million in 2008 compared to $246.0 million in 2007. In 2008 investing activities include $516.7 million of capital expenditures, $45.2 million received from the redemption of short-term investments and $60.6 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties in our Mexican operations. The $516.7 million of capital expenditures includes the following expenditures at our Peruvian operations, $118.0 million for the Tia Maria project, $37.7 million for the Toquepala expansion project, $18.2 million for the Cuajone expansion project, $21.7 million for the tailing disposal project, $17.3 million for electrical shovels and $89.5 102 Table of Contents for equipment replacement and upgrades. Capital expenditures also include equipment replacement and upgrade of $145.0 million at Mexican our open pit operations, $44.2 million in our IMMSA unit and $25.1 million for our administrative office in Mexico. Net cash used for investing activities was $246.0 million in 2007 compared to $725.3 million in 2006. In 2007, investing activities include $315.7 million of capital expenditures, $217.9 million for the purchase of short-term investments, less $287.4 million received on the redemption of short-term investments. The $315.7 million of capital expenditures, includes $21.0 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $13.8 million for the Toquepala leach dump project, $10.5 million for the PLS dam project and $270.4 million for equipment replacements and upgrades of which $188.6 million was for our Mexican operations. Net cash used for investing activities was $725.3 million in 2006. In 2006, investing activities include $455.8 million of capital expenditures, and short-term investments of $280.0 million. The $455.8 million of capital expenditures includes $160.9 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $15.6 million for the Toquepala leach dump project and $279.3 million principally for equipment replacements and upgrades, of which $202.5 million was for our Mexican operations. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For 2008, cash used for financing activities amounted to $2,048.0 million, and included a shareholder dividend distribution of $1,710.8 million, a distribution to minority interest investors of $10.2 million, $384.7 million for the repurchase of 28.5 million shares of our common stock and $160.0 million of debt repayment. In addition, we received $216.4 million from the sale of 350 million shares of our parent company’s common stock. See Note 15 “Stockholder Equity”. For 2007, cash used for financing activities amounted $2,088.3 million, mainly for a dividend distribution of $2,002.3 million to our shareholders and $7.2 million to our remaining minority interest investors. In 2007, financing activities also include $68.6 million for the repurchase of our Yankee bonds series B and $10.0 million for the amortization of the Mitsui loan. For 2006, cash used for financing activities amounted to $1,164.3 million, mainly for a dividend distribution of $1,509.1 million to our shareholders and $8.3 million to our remaining minority interest investors. In addition, net debt incurred in 2007 was $356.0 million. Other Liquidity Considerations In 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an up to $500 million share repurchase program. Under this program we may purchase shares from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. The shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. During 2008 we repurchased 28.5 million shares at an average cost of $13.49 totaling $384.7 million. Please see note 22 to the financial statements, “Subsequent events” for repurchase activity in 2009. On January 30, 2009 the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of 11.7 cents per share to be paid on March 30, 2009 to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2009. Our dividend policy continues to be reviewed at Board of Directors’ meetings, taking 103 Table of Contents into consideration the current capital investment program and expected future cash flow generated from operations. We expect that it will meet our cash requirements for 2009 and beyond from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. In December 2006, our Peruvian Branch signed a contract with the Peruvian government committing our Company to make annual contributions for five years to support the regional development of Peru. The contributions are being used for social benefit programs. In 2008 and 2007, we made contributions of $18.9 million and $16.1 million out of 2007 and 2006 earnings, respectively and has charged 2008 earnings $12.2 million for the 2009 contribution. Future contributions could increase or decrease depending on earnings and copper prices. If the average annual LME copper price is below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. In June 2004, the Peruvian Congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies. Under this law, we are subject to a 1% to 3% charge, based on sales, applicable to the value of the concentrates produced. We made a provision of $53.9 million, $62.8 million and $67.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, for this charge. During 2008, 2007 and 2006 we made payments of $58.0 million, $64.0 million and $67.1 million, respectively, related to this charge. Financing Our total debt at December 31, 2008 was $1,306.4 million compared with $1,466.4 million at December 31, 2007 before the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $16.4 million and $16.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $160.0 million net decrease in total debt during 2008 was due to the payment of $150.0 million of Yankee bonds series A. With this payment the Series A Yankee bonds were fully repaid. Additionally we paid $10.0 million of its Mitsui loan Our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 27.5% at December 31, 2008, compared with 27.3% at December 31, 2007. Capital Expenditure Programs A discussion of our capital expenditure programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Expansion Program” of this section. 104 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments due by Period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 1,306.4 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 1,256.4 Interest on debt 2,188.2 94.7 94.2 94.0 93.5 93.3 1,718.5 FIN No. 48 (a) 70.3 — — — — — — Workers’ participation 218.9 218.9 Contribution to the Peruvian regional development 12.2 12.2 Pension and post-retirement obligations 93.5 24.6 5.2 5.4 5.6 6.0 46.7 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,061.0 184.3 134.0 117.3 117.3 117.3 390.9 Capital expenditure projects and material 596.2 273.0 323.2 — — — — Total $ 5,546.7 $ 817.7 $ 566.6 $ 226.7 $ 226.4 $ 226.6 $ 3,412.5 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to FIN No.48 liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2008 the liability recognized by the Company is $70.3 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2008. Please refer to “Note 11-Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on Branch’s taxable income and is distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pursuant to our agreement with the Peruvian Government signed on December 28, 2006 we have committed to make annual contributions for five years for the regional development of Peru based on Peruvian Branch earnings after income tax. Future contributions could increase or decrease depending on copper prices. The commitment of the Branch is for a total of 1.25% of its annual earnings, after Peruvian income tax. If the average annual LME copper price drops below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. For an additional discussion on this matter please see “Regional development contribution” on “Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefit expected to be paid under our post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit plans” of our consolidated financial statements. We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Energia del Sur, S.A. until 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on power costs in 2008, 105 Table of Contents which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Peruvian projects of Tia Maria and the Toquepala concentrator expansion. These commitments are under re-evaluation and subject to renegotiation due to the current economic situation. Also, this line item includes committed purchase orders for operating material at our operations. Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation- Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 80) to GAAP cost of sales in millions of dollars and cents per pound in the table below: 2008 2007 2006 $ million $ per unit $ million $ per unit $ million $ per unit Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)—GAAP $ 2,182.2 $ 1.890 $ 2,122.2 $ 1.644 $ 2,019.8 $ 1.468 Add: Selling, general and administrative 102.4 0.089 98.0 0.076 88.3 0.064 Treatment and refining charges 40.8 0.035 57.9 0.045 61.0 0.044 By-product revenue (1) (1,584.8 ) (1.373 ) (1,952.7 ) (1.513 ) (1,547.1 ) (1.124 ) Less: Workers’ participation (212.1 ) (0.184 ) (310.9 ) (0.241 ) (271.5 ) (0.197 ) Royalty charge and other, net (111.1 ) (0.095 ) (155.0 ) (0.120 ) (127.1 ) (0.093 ) Inventory change (23.9 ) (0.021 ) (31.5 ) (0.024 ) (4.4 ) (0.003 ) Operating Cash Cost $ 393.5 $ 0.341 $ (172.0 ) $ (0.133 ) $ 219.0 $ 0.159 Less by-product revenue 1,584.8 1.373 1,952.7 1.513 1,547.1 1.124 Operating Cash Cost, without by-product revenue $ 1,978.3 $ 1.714 $ 1,780.7 $ 1.380 $ 1,766.1 $ 1.283 Total pounds of copper produced and purchased (in millions) 1,154.6 1,291.0 1,375.9 (1) Includes net by-product sales revenue and premiums on sales of refined products. 106 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based upon our indebtedness at December 31, 2008, a change in interest rates of one percent (or 100 basis points) would impact net income and cash flows by $0.5 million annually. We are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. To manage the volatility related to the risk, we may enter into forward exchange contracts, currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 6.6 % 3.9 % 1.1 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 4.8 % (6.3 )% (6.8 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 6.5 % 3.8 % 4.1 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 24.5 % (0.1 )% 1.5 % Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate change of 10% at December 31, 2008, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Variance Effect in net earnings ($ in million) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of dollar vs. Nuevo sol $ 12.9 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (15.7 ) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 11.4 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (14.0 ) The net monetary position is the net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2008. It principally includes cash and various receivables and liabilities in local currencies. Metal price sensitivity: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price 107 Table of Contents sensitivity factors would indicate estimated changes in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2009 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 6.0 $ 22.4 $ 1.3 $ 9.7 We occasionally use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rate and exchange rate risk exposures. We generally do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposing our Company to market risk. Copper and zinc swaps: During 2008, 2007 and 2006 we entered into copper collar and swap contracts to protect a portion of our sales of copper production as follows 2008 2007 2006 Collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) 220.5 170.5 — Average LME cap price $ 4.23 $ 4.07 — Average LME floor price $ 3.40 $ 3.20 — Swap contracts: Pounds (in millions) 175.1 11.9 847.7 Weighted average COMEX price $ 3.87 $ 3.71 $ 3.17 Related to the settlement of these copper collar and swap contracts, we recorded gains of $137.0 million and $10.9 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a loss of $276.1 million in 2006. These gains and losses were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, these gains and losses were recorded in net earnings in operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash flow. In addition, in 2006 we entered into a zinc swap contract to protect the cost of a portion of the zinc concentrates purchased during the recovery from a fire at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery. Related to the settlement of this zinc swap contract we recorded a loss of $0.2 million in 2006. This loss was recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, this loss was recorded in net earnings in operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash flow. We did not enter into any zinc derivative contracts in 2008 and 2007. At December 31, 2008 we did not hold any open copper or zinc derivative contracts. Transactions under these metal price protection programs are not accounted for as hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Gas swaps: In the last three years we entered into gas swap contracts to protect part of our gas consumption in both periods as follows: 108 Table of Contents 2008 2007 2006 Gas volume (MMBTUs) 460,000 900,000 3,650,000 Fixed price $ 8.2175 $ 7.5250 $ 4.2668 (Loss) gain (in millions) $ (0.9 ) $ (0.9 ) $ 6.3 The losses and gain obtained were included in the production cost. At December 31, 2008, we did not hold any open gas swap contracts. Exchange Rate Derivatives, U.S. dollar / Mexican peso contracts: Because more than 85% of our sales collections in Mexico are in US dollars and many of our costs are in Mexican pesos, we entered into zero-cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting, within a range, against an appreciation of the Mexican peso to the US dollar. At December 31, 2008 we held two types of exchange rate derivative contracts: In the first type of exchange rate derivative contract, if the exchange rate settles at or below the barrier price, we do not sell US dollars, if the exchange rate settles above the barrier price and below the strike price established in the contract, we sell the notional amount of US dollars settling in the week at the strike price. If the exchange rate settles above the strike price established in the contract, we sell double the underlying amount of US dollars settling in the week at the strike price established in the contract. At December 31, 2008, we held the following contracts of this type: Notional Amount (millions) Underlying amount (millions) Due Date, Weekly expiration until Strike Price (Mexican Pesos/U.S. Dollars) Barrier Price (Mexican Pesos/ U.S. Dollars) $ 15.0 $ 1.25 March 11, 2009 11.25 10.60 Each notional amount includes a group of underlying amount transactions that have the same strike and barrier price. In the second type of exchange rate derivative contract, if the exchange rate is less than or equal to the strike price, we sell US dollars in an amount equal to the underlying amount for the expiration period at the strike price. The difference between the strike price and the market exchange rate is considered a gain to us. The total accumulated gain over the life of the contract cannot exceed 200 cents per dollar transacted in the first contract and 500 cents per dollar transacted in the second contract. If the exchange rate is above the strike price, we sell dollars in an amount equal to 2 times the underlying amount for the expiration period at the strike price and the loss does not reduce the accumulated gain. At December 31, 2008, we held the following contracts of this type: Notional Amount (millions) Underlying amount (millions) Expiration Period Due Date Strike Price (Mexican Pesos/ U.S. Dollars) $ 15.0 $ 2.5 Monthly January 13, 2009 through June 11, 2009 10.59 $ 85.0 $ 2.5 Weekly January 2, 2009 through August 21, 2009 10.53 Each notional amount includes a group of underlying amount transactions that have the same strike and barrier price. 109 Table of Contents The exercise of these zero-cost derivative contracts resulted in a realized loss of $17.8 million in 2008 and gains of $8.1 million and $0.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which were recorded as Loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of earnings. At December 31, 2008, the mark-to-market of the above listed exchange rate derivative contracts generated an unrealized loss of $56.8 million which was recorded as Loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of earnings. If the exchange rate of the Mexican Peso to the US Dollar were to increase or decrease by 10%, the additional loss or benefit of these derivative instruments would not be considered material to our overall results of operations. Dual currency notes: In 2007 we invested $560.0 million in dual currency notes which provided an above market interest return subject to a barrier range of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rates. Related to these investments we realized an exchange loss of $1.3 million, which was recorded as a loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of earnings. At December 31, 2008, we did not hold any dual currency notes. We earned interest of $2.1 million in 2007, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Short-term investments: The balance of short-term investments was as follows (in millions): As of Investments December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Short-term investments in securities issued by public companies with a weighted average interest rate of 1.85%. $ 62.4 $ 117.9 Short-term investments in securities consist of available for sale securities issued by public companies. The Company has a diversified portfolio of investments. In 2008, we earned interest of $4.1 million, respectively, related to these investments which were recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. In addition, in 2008, we redeemed $45.2 million of these investments. During 2008 we lost $10.3 million on these investments. We considered this loss to be other than temporary, and therefore have recorded it as other expense in the consolidated statement of earnings. During 2007 we invested $380.0 million in investment instruments, some of which were indexed to SCC common stock prices while others were leveraged and indexed to certain bond pools. The entire amount of these investment instruments were liquidated during the course of 2007. Related to these investments, we realized losses of $81.0 million in 2007 which were recorded as loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of earnings. Additionally, we earned interest of $18.7 million on these investments in 2007 which were recorded in interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Impact of New Accounting Standards In December 2008 the FASB approved FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits” (FSP No. FAS 110 Table of Contents 132(R)-1), which provides guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP also includes a technical amendment to Statement 132(R) that requires a nonpublic entity to disclose net periodic benefit cost for each annual period for which a statement of income is presented. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP shall be provided for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This statement is effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” We do not expect any material impact on our financial position and results of operations with the adoption of this statement. On March 19, 2008 the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently analyzing the effect that this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB published SFAS No. 160 “Non Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” — an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement addresses the reporting of minority interests in the results of the parent and provides direction for the recording of such interests in the financial statements. It also provides guidance for the recording of various transactions related to the minority interests, as well as certain disclosure requirements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us, including our Minera Mexico subsidiary, on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business” - “Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We believe we endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile. In addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a byproduct of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. Our revenues in 2009 include the sale of copper approximately 71%, molybdenum approximately 12%, silver approximately 7%, and 10% from various other products including zinc, gold and other materials. We believe that our greatest strength lies in our copper ore reserves, which at December 31, 2009 totaled 55.4 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $1.80 per pound (as of December 31, 2009 the LME and COMEX copper price was $3.33). In terms of copper reserves, we believe we hold the world’s largest reserve position. Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · Changes in copper and molybdenum prices. Copper represents about 71% of our sales. Molybdenum is expected to begin trading on the LME this year and we view that as positive in the long-term outlook for molybdenum. Molybdenum represents about 12% of our sales. · We expect that the 2010 production of copper and molybdenum will match our 2009 production levels. 80 Table of Contents · We have a capital investment program of $2.8 billion for the next three years (2010-2012), which is expected to increase annual copper production by 342,000 tons and molybdenum by 6,600 tons. · In the year 2010 we expect capital spending of $600 million in Peru and $200 million in Mexico. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 2009: 2009 2008 2007 Net sales (in millions) $ 3,734 $ 4,851 $ 6,086 Net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 929 $ 1,407 $ 2,216 Earnings per share $ 1.09 $ 1.60 $ 2.51 Dividends per share $ 0.44 $ 1.94 $ 2.27 Average LME copper price $ 2.34 $ 3.16 $ 3.23 Pounds of copper sold (in millions) 1,118 1,115 1,330 The 2009 net sales and earnings show a decrease from 2008 and 2007. The 2009 copper sales volume closely matches 2008, albeit with a slight increase. The average sales price in 2009 is substantially below 2008, which in turn is slightly under the 2007 price. While the average price for the year is well below 2008, we closed 2008 on a much more pessimistic note as prices fell precipitously at the end of the year due principally to the turmoil in the United States financial markets and concern about the global economy. Conversely, we have closed 2009 with promising growth in the price of copper. We have witnessed a steady growth in the copper price throughout the year, with prices in the first quarter of the year averaging about $1.55 per pound rising to a little over an average of $3.00 in the fourth quarter. While we recognize that price fluctuations will occur, as is normal in this industry, we do expect that as the world’s economies stabilize, the outlook for the copper market will continue to improve over the next few years. However, the prices of our metal products, including copper prices, are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described in our “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. The sales volume drop from 2007, described above, largely reflects the loss of sales from the Cananea mine, which for all practical purposes has been on strike since mid-2007, see below. Production: The table below highlight key, mine production data of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 2009: 2009 2008 2007 Copper mined (in million pounds) 1,070 1,078 1,306 Molybdenum mined (in million pounds) 41.2 36.1 35.7 Zinc mined (in million pounds) 243 236 267 Silver mined (in million ounces) 13.2 12.3 15.2 Copper mined in 2009 was about 8 million pounds under the 2008 copper mine production. A net increase at our Peruvian mines of 11 million pounds, largely from improved recovery and higher grade at the Toquepala mine, plus an increase of 15 million pounds from La Caridad mine, due to higher recoveries and grades, was offset by production losses due to the Cananea strike. In 2008, we were able to produce 34 million of copper at Cananea during the early part of the year. In 2009, Cananea was completely shutdown. Molybdenum production increased by approximately 5 million pounds in 2009 due primarily to an increase of approximately 5 million pounds at La Caridad, due to grade and recovery increases. Zinc production, which is from our IMMSA Unit in Mexico, increased by approximately 7 million pounds in 2009. Silver production increased 7.2% in 2009, with increases occurring at our operations in Mexico and Peru. 81 Table of Contents The decrease in copper production in 2008 from the prior year was largely due to the production lost at Cananea because of the strike which began in July 2007. Cananea strike: Operations at our Cananea mine remained closed in 2009 because of the ongoing strike. This strike began in July 2007, and remains unresolved. However, on February 10, 2010 a Mexican Federal Labor court ruled that the damages caused to the Cananea mine by the neglect and sabotage of striking workers since the commencement of the labor stoppages in July 2007 resulted in force majeure, thus providing a legal basis for the termination of individual and unionized employees by the Company. We expect due compliance with the referred ruling by the relevant federal and state authorities and look forward to recovering control of the Cananea mine. We do anticipate that once we recover control of the mine it will take a few months to restore production at Cananea. It is difficult at this juncture to be more specific as to the time necessary to accomplish this, as the Cananea facilities are occupied by the striking workers. While during 2009, we have continued to provide periodic maintenance to the assets of the facility, our management will need to assess the situation once our control of Cananea is reestablished. Additionally, our San Martin and Taxco facilities also remained on strike. Due to the lengthy work stoppage we have performed an impairment analysis on the assets at the Cananea mine. We have determined through our impairment analysis that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2009. The results of our impairment tests may vary depending on certain assumptions used in formulating the estimate, including, but not limited to, our assumptions regarding when we expect to resume operations at Cananea, as well as estimates regarding future metals prices. We are hopeful that this strike will be resolved in the near future. However, despite our best efforts the strike is now in its third year. Based on our evaluation of the circumstances as of December 31, 2009, we believe that among the possible outcomes, the most likely scenario is that the strike will be resolved and that we will resume operations at that mine during 2010. If the resumption of operations were delayed by more than a year beyond our assumption, we estimate that the test would have resulted in an additional charge to earnings for writedowns of leachable materials assets of approximately $42 million. Should estimates of future copper and molybdenum prices decrease significantly, such determination could change. The price assumptions used for estimating reserves based on SEC guidance of $2.90 per pound for copper and $23.44 per pound for molybdenum results in no impairment. However, as noted above, we also conducted the test using the significantly lower long-term price assumptions of $1.80 per pound of copper and $11.00 per pound of molybdenum, which also yielded no impairment. According to our best estimates, we believe that the Cananea assets would not be recoverable using a price assumption of approximately $0.90 per pound of copper. Major capital projects: On January 28, 2010 our Board of Directors approved an investment program of $2.8 billion for the next three years (2010-2012), which is expected to increase annual copper production by approximately 342,000 tons and molybdenum production by approximately 6,600 tons, when this program is completed. The program also aims to improve cost competitiveness and efficiencies. The approved program considers some ongoing projects as well as new initiatives and will start at our Peruvian operations with the Tia Maria greenfield project and the Toquepala concentrator expansion. See further discussion under caption “Capital expansion programs” below in this section. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These include, (i) our “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (ii) metal prices, (iii) business segments, (iv) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (v) our capital expansion programs. Operating Cash Costs An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. We have revised our calculation of “operating cash cost” to exclude the cost of purchases of third party copper material. From time to time we purchase copper concentrates on the open market in order to maximize the use of our smelter capacity or to take advantage of an attractive market situation. We view these purchases on an incremental basis 82 Table of Contents and measure the results incrementally. We find that the inclusion of these purchases with our own production often creates a distortion in our unit cost. Accordingly, we have revised our presentation of operating cash costs to include only the net effect of these purchases, so that only the net revenue or loss from the transaction is included in the calculation. We believe this will allow others to see a truer presentation of our cash cost. Amounts for prior years have been restated to show this change. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), less the cost of purchased concentrates, plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges, net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties and by-products revenues, and sales premiums; less workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products, principally molybdenum, zinc, silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in silver and zinc, has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. We exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the royalty charges. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2009. We present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by-product revenues. Year Positive (negative) Variance (Cents per pound) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced 36.0 21.8 (24.7 ) (14.2 ) (46.5 ) Less: by-products revenue 100.0 135.3 153.8 (35.3 ) (18.5 ) Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-products revenue 136.0 157.1 129.1 21.1 (28.0 ) 2009 against 2008: As seen on the chart above, our cash cost per pound for 2009 when calculated with by-products revenue is 36.0 cents per pound compared with 21.8 cents per pound in 2008. The decrease in the by-products credit in the 2009 period was largely due to lower molybdenum prices. The effect of lower molybdenum prices reduced the by-products credit by approximately 30.7 cents per pound for 2009. 83 Table of Contents Our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was lower by 21.1 cents per pound in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease of 19.4 cents per pound in production cost as result of the modernization of our equipment and the lower power and fuel cost which decreased cash cost by 15.9 cents. 2008 against 2007: As seen on the chart above, our cash cost per pound for 2008 when calculated with by-products revenue is 21.8 cents per pound compared with a credit of 24.7 cents per pound in 2007. The increase in cash cost per pound is due to a decrease in the by-products credit and higher operating cost of 28 cents. The decrease in the by products credit in the 2008 period was largely due to lower molybdenum prices especially in the last quarter of the year. The effect of lower molybdenum prices reduced the by-products credit by approximately 13.2 cents per pound for 2008. Our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was higher by 28 cents per pound in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease of 11.6% in copper production, principally as a result of the Cananea mine strike, which increased cash cost by 18.1 cents and the higher power and fuel cost which increased cash cost by 15.7 cents. Metals Prices The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to speculative activities. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2010 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver – per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 5.7 $ 22.1 $ 1.3 $ 9.5 Business Segments We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA Unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product 84 Table of Contents production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Cananea mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA Unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Devaluation of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 0.2 % 6.6 % 3.9 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (8.0 )% 4.8 % (6.3 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.6 % 6.5 % 3.8 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (3.5 )% 24.5 % (0.1 )% Capital Expansion Program We made capital expenditures of $414.8 million, $524.4 million and $315.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and we expect to make capital expenditures, of approximately $800 million in 2010. In general, the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to increase production and/or decrease costs. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2009 (in millions): 85 Table of Contents Projects 2009 2008 2007 Ilo smelter modernization (including marine trestle) $ 10.2 $ 6.6 $ 21.0 Tia Maria – Arequipa –Peru 162.0 118.0 — Cuajone ball mill — 1.4 10.0 Toquepala crushing, conveying system for leach material — 0.1 2.0 Toquepala concentrator expansion 52.6 37.7 — Cuajone concentrator expansion 4.3 18.2 Tailings disposal – Quebrada Honda dam 5.6 21.7 13.8 Cuajone leaching pad — — 1.4 PLS dams at Huanaquera — 0.3 10.5 Pilares mine – land purchase — 20.0 — La Caridad tailings dam - internal dikes 2.2 2.1 2.1 Metallurgical laboratory – La Caridad 0.8 1.5 1.8 La Caridad gas handling system — 11.3 12.2 La Caridad by-products treatment plant 1.8 6.9 — La Caridad Vertical lime kiln 9.3 7.1 2.0 La Caridad Effluent and dust treatment plant 6.2 — — PLS dams and leaching system Cananea 1.3 — 4.1 Cananea SX/EW plant III — — 0.2 Cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material Phases II and III — 13.6 21.5 La Caridad crusher high efficiency system — 2.8 — San Luis Potosi effluent treatment plant. 4.9 La Caridad tailings dam growth – Concentrator — — 1.9 El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 10.4 3.9 — Santa Barbara Segovedad II mine expansion and conveyor and main substation — 6.5 3.7 Total project expenditures 271.6 279.7 108.2 Replacement capital expenditures: Mexico 93.5 146.2 139.0 Peru 49.7 98.5 68.5 Total replacement expenditures 143.2 244.7 207.5 Total capital expenditures $ 414.8 $ 524.4 $ 315.7 We are committed to continuing the growth of the Company. We previously deferred several project development activities because of the downturn in global economic conditions. Neverthless, on January 28, 2010 our Board of Directors approved an investment program of $2.8 billion for the next three years which is expected to increase by approximately 342,000 tons of copper production and by approximately 6,600 tons of molybdenum of production, when this program is completed. The program also aims to improve cost competitiveness and efficiencies. However, capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in the economy or market conditions. The Company intends to allocate approximately $1.8 billion to Peru and $1.0 billion to Mexico of which approximately $600 million and $200 million are intended to be invested in Peru and Mexico, respectively, in year 2010. Set forth below are descriptions of some of our current expected capital expenditures. The Company expects to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. Peruvian Operations Tia Maria project: This project in the Peruvian region of Arequipa, is expected to produce about 260 million pounds of SX-EW copper cathodes per year. The approved budget for the project is $934 million. Through December 31, 2009, $280 million were spent on its development. The detailed engineering is in progress. Work on the project includes equipment fabrication and some early construction work (access roads and platforms). The environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project is currently pending approval and the Company is working to secure it. A necessary step in order to obtain approval for the EIA requires the Company to hold and complete a public hearing, in which the concerns of the local community are addressed. In August 2009, a public hearing held by the Compnay was disrupted and not completed. A hearing originally scheduled for February 15, 2010, has been postponed and the Company is working with the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”) to reschedule the hearing. Construction is delayed pending approval of the EIA. 86 Table of Contents Toquepala concentrator expansion: As of December 31, 2009, the Company has expended $90.3 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion. Detailed engineering was awarded and work started in December 2009. One 320 ton truck and two 49HR drilling machines and a second 73 cubic yard shovel were put in operation. The push back substation expansion was also completed and is currently in operation. The environmental impact study is still being conducted and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2010. Ilo Smelter Modernization: A complementary project to the Ilo smelter modernization is the construction of a marine trestle to offload directly to offshore ships the sulfuric acid produced at the smelter. At December 31, 2009 this project reached 98.0% completion and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2010. The completed project is expected to ease congestion in our Ilo area. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project will increase the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills. The procurement of the main equipment and materials was finished. Construction of the principal civil, mechanical and electrical installations for the main and lateral dams has been completed. The equipment to build the lateral dam was commissioned in December 2008 and the equipment to continue building the main dam was commissioned in March 2009. At this time there are some pending issues in order to get to the design capacity. Progress on the first stage of this project is 99.8% complete, with final completion expected in the first quarter of 2010. The total cost of this project is estimated to be $66.0 million, with $43.7 million expended through December 31, 2009. Mexican Operations After expending $16.0 million, the by-product treatment plant at the La Caridad metallurgical complex was completed in 2009 and is currently in operation. This plant was distinguished winning the first prize in a nationwide contest to promote waste recycling. With a total investment of $20.8 million, the lime plant at Agua Prieta, which is 100 kilometers north of the La Caridad mine, was fully modernized to comply with environmental regulations and to meet the lime requirements of the Mexican operations. A vertical Maerz furnace will reduce the consumption of natural gas to a third of its current level and we expect costs to be reduced by approximately 45%. Performance tests were completed during December 2009, with results exceeding the established parameters. Other capital expenditures The El Arco project is a major copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with estimated mineralized material of over 1.3 billion tons. This project is expected to produce approximately 190,000 tons of copper and approximately 105,000 ounces of gold annually. The Company continues to invest in land acquisition required for the project. A study for the supply of natural gas to support a 220 mega-watt power plant has been initiated. The Company will consider the development of this project subject to appropriate investment conditions. Potential projects We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return, environmental needs, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. 87 Table of Contents The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $1.80 per pound for copper and $11.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term. Our management uses these price assumptions, as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $2.90 per pound for copper and $23.44 per pound for molybdenum, both current average prices as of December 31, 2009. The current average per pound prices for copper and molybdenum were $3.15 and $28.02, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $2.66 and $28.99, respectively, as of December 31, 2007. Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. However, variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions do not create material changes to our financial results. Leachable Material: At one of our Mexican mines, we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process (leachable material), which is collected in leach dumps. The amortization of the capitalized cost is 88 Table of Contents determined based on the depletion period of the leach dumps, which is estimated to be five years. If we did not have this policy and were to expense leaching costs as incurred, net operating cost would have decreased by $44.1 million, $57.6 million and $10.1 million for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In each of these three years, the annual amortization expense exceeded amount of the leaching cost that was capitalized. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. We further discuss in our Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix power prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates, currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar conversion rates. Gains and losses related to copper and zinc hedges are included in net sales, gain and losses related to power costs are included in cost of sales, all other gains and losses on derivative contracts are included in “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments” in the consolidated statement of earnings. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 89 Table of Contents bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Tax” (FIN 48 “Uncertain tax positions” in prior literature) to record these liabilities. (See Note 8 “Income taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $1.80 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $11.00 per pound, along with near-term price forecast, for 2010, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. Please see “Executive Overview - Cananea Strike” for discussion of impairment analysis related to the Cananea mine.

SEGMENT SALES INFORMATION The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009: Copper Sales (million pounds) 2009 2008 2007 Peruvian operations 808.4 762.2 787.8 Mexican open-pit 289.0 321.9 512.0 Mexican IMMSA Unit 34.6 35.4 30.9 Other and intersegment elimination (14.2 ) (5.0 ) (0.2 ) Total copper sales 1,117.8 1,114.5 1,330.5 By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver - million ounces) 2009 2008 2007 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 19.6 20.4 21.9 Silver 4.3 3.8 4.9 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 21.4 16.0 14.0 Silver 6.5 4.4 3.6 IMMSA Unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 228.0 220.7 250.6 Silver 12.3 8.9 10.7 Other and intersegment elimination Zinc 0.9 0.5 1.2 Silver (4.9 ) (2.1 ) (0.9 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 41.0 36.4 35.9 Zinc-refined and in concentrate 228.9 221.2 251.8 Silver 18.2 15.0 18.3 92 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008. Net sales Net sales in 2009 were $3,734.3 million, compared with $4,850.8 million in 2008, a decrease of $1,116.5 million. The decrease was principally a result of lower average metal prices, partially offset by increases in sales volume. Copper sales volume increased slightly in 2009. However, molybdenum, and silver sales volume increased 12.6% and 21.1%, respectively, as a result of higher grades and recovery at our Cuajone and La Caridad mines. In addition, zinc sales volume increased 3.5% due to higher grades and recoveries. The decline in metal prices, which began late in 2008 and continued into 2009 began to recover in the second quarter of 2009 and continued through the balance of the year. Copper prices averaged over $3.00 per pound in the fourth quarter and closed 2009 at $3.33 per pound. The average molybdenum and zinc prices in 2009 were 61.6% and 11.8% lower than 2008, respectively. Net sales in 2008 also include a $137.0 million gain on copper derivatives. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2009 and 2008. Copper Sales by product (million pounds) 2009 2008 Refined 692.4 657.4 Blister 46.6 21.9 Anode 36.0 22.0 Concentrates and other 100.3 101.4 SX/EW 108.1 142.2 Rod 134.4 169.6 Total 1,117.8 1,114.5 Mine copper production was 1,070.1 million pounds in 2009, a decrease of 0.7% from 2008. This decrease of 7.8 million pounds included a reduction of 19.4 million pounds at our Mexican open-pit segment mainly due to the strike at our Cananea mine, which was partially offset by an increase of 11.1 million pounds at our Peruvian mines due to higher ore grades and recoveries at the Toquepala mine. Molybdenum production was 41.2 million pounds in 2009, a 14.0% increase from 2008. This increase was principally due to higher ore grades at the La Caridad and Cuajone mines. Mine zinc production amounted to 243.5 million pounds in 2009, a 3.3% increase from 2008. The increase of 7.7 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to higher ore grades at the Santa Barbara mine, and higher recoveries at the Santa Eulalia and Charcas mines. Copper made up 70.7% of net sales in 2009 compared with 69.2% in 2008. Sales of by-products in 2009 totaled $1,095.4 million compared with $1,495.9 million in 2008, a decrease of 26.8%. The decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the sales prices for molybdenum and zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. 93 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2009 2008 Molybdenum 11.7 % 16.5 % Zinc 4.7 % 4.0 % Silver 7.4 % 4.3 % Other by-products 5.5 % 6.0 % Total 29.3 % 30.8 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2009 was $1,823.7 million, compared with $2,182.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $358.5 million, or 16.4%. The decrease in cost of sales was principally due to 1) $269.8 million of lower production cost, including, $200.8 million of lower fuel and power cost due to lower market prices, $28.8 million of lower operating and repair material cost and $28.4 million of lower contractor services at our Mexican operations, both mainly due to lower repairs at La Caridad mine, 2) $77.5 million of lower workers’ participation as a result of lower earnings and 3) $4.8 million of lower mine royalties due to lower sales value. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2009 was $78.3 million, compared with $102.4 million in 2008, a decrease of $24.1 million. The decrease was mainly due to $8.5 million of lower legal and consulting services in 2009, from amounts spent in 2008 for improvements in information systems technology and tax and internal controls, $7.2 million of lower cost resulting from the devaluation of the Mexican peso, $1.5 million of lower taxes on financial transactions at our Peruvian operations and $1.5 million of lower technical assistance and software licences payments. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2009 was $24.6 million and included $14.6 million in Peru (including Chile) and $10.0 million in Mexico, compared with $37.0 million in 2008, of which $20.4 million was in Peru (including Chile) and $16.6 million in Mexico. Exploration expense in Peru decreased $5.8 million mainly as a result of the Tia Maria project entering the development stage. In 2008, exploration spending in Tia Maria was $5.0 million. Please see “Capital Expansion Program”, under this Item 7. Also, in 2009 exploration expenses decreased $1.1 million in Chile due to lower drilling and reduced field work. Exploration spending in Mexico was $6.6 million lower in 2009 and includes a decrease of $3.5 million at the IMMSA mines of Charcas and Santa Eulalia and a decrease of $3.1 million at the La Caridad mine. These decreases were the result of less drilling and field work in 2009. Interest expense Interest expense in 2009 was $99.7 million compared with $105.9 million in 2008, a decrease of $6.2 million. Interest expense decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in our average debt outstanding, mainly due to the payment of $150 million of the series A of our Yankee bonds in April 2008 and the amortization and decrease in interest rate of the Mitsui loan. 94 Table of Contents Interest income Interest income in 2009 was $6.6 million, compared with $48.4 million in 2008, a decrease of $41.8 million. Our interest income decreased largely as a result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rate. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments Gain on derivative instruments in 2009 was $4.2 million compared with a loss of $74.6 million in 2008. The losses on derivative instruments in 2009 and 2008 are all related to the U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives. The Mexican peso has appreciated 3.5% in 2009 compared to a devaluation of 24.5% in 2008. For a further discussion please see Note 16 “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. Gains or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gains or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was income of $6.1 million in 2009 compared to an income of $17.2 million in 2008. The decrease of $11.1 million includes $27.1 million of lower income at our Mexican operations and $16.0 million of higher income at our Peruvian operations. The decrease in income at our Mexican operation was mainly due to $17.8 million of lower gain on the sale of inactive properties and $5.5 lower miscellaneous sales. The increase in income at our Peruvian operation was largely due to a gain in the mark to market valuation of short-term investments in 2009 of $3.4 million compared with a loss of $10.3 million in 2008. Income taxes Income taxes in 2009 were $469.9 million and include $471.1 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $1.2 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2008 were $679.3 million and include $724.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $45.0 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The decrease of $209.4 million or 30.8% was primarily due to $689.3 million of lower pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2009 was 33.5%, compared with 32.5% in 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate is largely due to dividends received by the Company from tax jurisdictions with lower tax rate (Mexico 28%). The dividend income is taxed in the U.S. at a rate of 35%. The rate increase caused by this differential of 28% versus 35% was partially offset by benefits recognized when the Company settled prior year audits. Please see, Note 8 “Income taxes” for further discussion of the settlement. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2009 was $5.2 million compared with $7.9 million in 2008, a decrease of $2.7 million or 34%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. 95 Table of Contents Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2009 was $929.4 million, compared with $1,406.6 million in 2008, a decrease of $477.2 million or 33.9%. Net income attributable to SCC decreased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information – 2009 vs.2008: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2009 2008 Value % Net sales $ 2,223.5 $ 2,803.2 $ (579.7 ) (20.7 ) Operating costs and expenses (1,206.2 ) (1,273.0 ) 66.8 5.2 Operating income $ 1,017.3 $ 1,530.2 $ (512.9 ) (33.5 ) Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2009 were $2,223.5 million, compared with $2,803.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $579.7 million. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in metal prices partially offset by an increase in copper and silver sales volume. The LME copper price was 25.9% lower in 2009 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum price was 61.6% lower. Copper and silver sales volume increased by 46.2 million pounds and 0.6 million ounces, respectively. The increase in copper sales volume was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala mine due to higher grades and recoveries. The increase in silver sales volume was due to higher production at both mines due to higher ore grades. Net sales in 2008 also include a gain on copper derivatives of $91.8 million while in 2009 we held no copper derivatives positions. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2009 were $1,206.2 million, compared with $1,273.0 million in 2008, a decrease of $66.8 million primarily due to lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,026.7 million in 2009, compared with $1,100.4 million in 2008. The decrease of $73.7 million was principally the result of 1) $121.8 million of lower cost of fuel and power due to a decrease in market prices and 2) $64.6 million of lower workers’ participation due to lower earnings. These decreases were partially offset by $99.0 million of higher copper concentrates purchased from third parties to cover smelter production requirements. Operating income in 2009 was $1,017.3 million, compared with $1,530.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $512.9 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2009 2008 Value % Net sales $ 1,076.7 $ 1,583.6 $ (506.9 ) (32.0 ) Operating costs and expenses (745.7 ) (949.5 ) 203.8 21.5 Operating income $ 331.0 $ 634.1 $ (303.1 ) (47.8 ) 96 Table of Contents Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2009 were $1,076.7 million, compared with $1,583.6 million in 2008, a decrease of $506.9 million. This decrease is a result of lower metal prices, and lower copper sales volume, mainly refined and rod, due to the loss of production at Cananea as a result of the ongoing strike. In 2008 we produced and sold 34 million pounds of copper at Cananea versus nothing in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in silver and molybdenum production and sales volume due to higher ore grades and recoveries at La Caridad mine. Net sales in 2008 included a gain on copper derivatives of $45.2 million while there was no copper derivative activity in 2009. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2009 was $745.7 million compared with $949.5 million in 2008, a decrease of $203.8 million. The decrease was the result of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2009 of $182.6 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $545.6 million in 2009, compared with $728.2 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily the effect of the ongoing strike at the Cananea mine and includes, 1) $100.1 million of lower production cost, 2) $22.3 million of lower workers’ participation, 3) $54.3 million of lower inventory consumption and 6) $14.0 million of severance payments in 2008. Operating income in 2009 was $331.0 million, compared with $634.1 million in 2008, a decrease of $303.1 million or 47.8%. The operating income decreased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA Unit. Change 2009 2008 Value % Net sales $ 560.2 $ 525.1 $ 35.1 6.7 Operating costs and expenses (423.3 ) (513.3 ) 90.0 17.5 Operating income $ 136.9 $ 11.8 $ 125.1 1,060.2 Net sales at our IMMSA Unit in 2009 were $560.2 million, compared with $525.1 million in 2008, an increase of $35.1 million. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher silver and zinc production and sales volume at the Santa Barbara mine as a result of higher ore grades and higher recoveries at the Santa Eulalia, Charcas and Santa Barbara mines, partially offset by lower metal prices. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA Unit were $423.3 million in 2009, compared with $513.3 million in 2008, a decrease of $90.0 million. This decrease was primarily the result of $69.3 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) included: 1) $54.9 million of lower production cost mainly due to lower market prices for fuel and power cost and 2) $21.4 million of lower inventory consumption. Operating income in 2009 was $136.9 million, compared with $11.8 million in 2008, an increase of $125.1 million. The operating income decreased primarily as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into 97 Table of Contents account. Please see Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007. Net sales Net sales in 2008 were $4,850.8 million, compared with $6,085.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $1,234.9 million or 20.3%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales volume of 16.2% and a decline in metal prices. Copper sales volume decreased 16.2% in 2008 due to a 17.4% decrease in production primarily due to the ongoing strike at the Cananea mine and lower ore grades at the Toquepala and La Caridad mines. In 2007, we also lost sales volume at Cananea due to a strike but to a lesser extent than in 2008. In addition, zinc and silver sales volume decreased as a result of the strikes at some of our other Mexican operations. The decline in metal prices began late in the third quarter of the year and continued through the fourth quarter. Copper was 2.8% and 2.2% lower in 2008, depending on whether it was COMEX or LME market, the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower and zinc prices were 42.2% lower. As a result of the decreasing copper and molybdenum prices, adjustments for provisionally priced sales reduced 2008 net sales by approximately $403.5 million. In 2008, approximately 60% of our copper and almost all of our molybdenum were sold under contracts that based the final sales price on months subsequent to shipment. Net sales in 2008 also include a $137.0 million gain on copper derivatives compared with a gain of $10.9 million in 2007. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products. Year Ended December 31, Copper Sales (million pounds) 2008 2007 Refined 657.4 586.4 Blister 21.9 51.4 Anode 22.0 31.1 Concentrates and other 101.4 255.9 SX/EW 142.2 190.4 Rod 169.6 215.3 Total 1,114.5 1,330.5 Mine copper production was 1,077.9 million pounds in 2008, a decrease of 17.4% from 2007. This decrease of 227.6 million pounds included a reduction of 204.1 million pounds at our Mexican operations mainly due to strike related reductions at our Cananea and San Martin mines which were on strike almost all of 2008 and lower ore grade and PLS processed at the La Caridad mine. Additionally, production at our Peruvian mines decreased by 23.5 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades and recoveries at the Toquepala mine. Molybdenum production and sales volume increased 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively in 2008 when compared to 2007. The increases are primarily due to higher grades from La Caridad mine. Mine zinc production amounted to 235.7 million pounds in 2008, an 11.6% decrease from 98 Table of Contents 2007. The decrease of 31.1 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to the strike losses at our Taxco and San Martin mines. Copper made up 69.2% of net sales in 2008 compared with 69.5% in 2007. Sales of by-products in 2008 totaled $1,495.9 million compared with $1,856.9 million in 2007, a decrease of 19.4%. The decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the sales prices for molybdenum as well as decrease in sales volume and prices for zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a Percentage of Total Net Sales 2008 2007 Molybdenum 16.5 % 17.8 % Zinc 4.0 % 6.0 % Silver 4.3 % 3.8 % Other by-products 6.0 % 2.9 % Total 30.8 % 30.5 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2008 was $2,182.2 million, compared with $2,122.2 million in 2007, an increase of $60.0 million, or 2.8%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to 1) $152.7 million of higher production cost, including, $113.2 million of higher fuel and power cost and $37.1 million of higher labor costs mainly at our Peruvian operations due to new labor agreements and the appreciation of the nuevo sol, and 2) $56.5 million of higher concentrates purchased from third parties to cover the loss of production at our Mexican mines. These increases were partially offset by 1) $98.8 million of lower workers participation, 2)$13.2 million of lower mining royalties both due to the decrease in revenues as a result of lower metal prices and 3)$29.8 million of gain in currency translation mainly due to the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was $102.4 million, compared with $98.0 million in 2007, an increase of $4.4 million. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs of $1.8 million, $1.5 million of higher legal and consulting services and $1.1 million of higher software and license fees. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2008 was $37.0 million and included $20.4 million in Peru (including Chile) and $16.6 million in Mexico, compared with $40.2 million in 2007, of which $25.4 million was in Peru (including Chile) and $14.8 million in Mexico. Exploration expense at Tia Maria decreased from $8.9 million in 2007 to $4.6 million in 2008. The spending in 2007 was high because it included the Tia Maria feasibility study. In 2008, Tia Maria entered the development stage as an economic project, please see “Capital Expansion Program,” under this Item 7. Also in Peru, exploration spending on the Los Chancas project increased to $3.2 million in 2008 from $0.9 million in 2007, as we increased our spending on drilling and field work in 2008. Additionally, in 2007 we spent $7.0 million on other feasibility studies, compared to $3.2 million in 2008. Exploration spending in Mexico was $16.6 million in 2008, as compared to $14.8 in 2007. Major spending in 2008 included drilling and field work at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines in our IMMSA Unit. 99 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense in 2008 was $105.9 million compared with $123.2 million in 2007, a decrease of $17.3 million. Interest expense decreased in 2008 as a result of a decrease in our average debt outstanding, mainly due to the payment in April 2008 of $150 million of Series A of our Yankee bonds. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of our financing program. Capitalized interest Capitalized interest in 2008 was $6.8 million, compared with $14.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $7.9 million. This decrease is mainly due to the startup of the Ilo smelter modernization project in early 2007 and the start up of the new PLS dump project at Toquepala in late 2007. Capitalized interest for these two projects was $3.2 million lower in 2008. Capitalized interest at our Mexican operations decreased by $4.7 million in 2008 due to payment of our Yankee bonds. Interest income Interest income in 2008 was $48.4 million, compared with $82.5 million in 2007, a decrease of $34.1 million. Our interest income decreased principally as a result of lower interest rates on cash investments in 2008 and lower average invested balances. Loss on debt prepayments Loss on debt prepayments in 2007 was $16.6 million. This loss was related to the repurchase of $68.6 million of Series B of our Yankee bonds. We did not prepay any debt in 2008. Loss on derivative instruments Loss on derivative instruments in 2008 was $74.6 million compared with $73.7 million in 2007. Gains or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gains or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. The loss on derivative instruments in 2008 and 2007 includes the following (in millions): 2008 2007 Gain (loss) on US dollar/ Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives $ (74.6 ) $ 8.6 Loss on embedded derivatives in short-term investments — (81.0 ) Loss on dual currency notes — (1.3 ) Total $ (74.6 ) $ (73.7 ) The $74.6 million loss on US dollar/ Mexican peso exchange rate in 2008 was a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso late in 2008. The Mexican peso devalued 24.5% in 2008 compared to an appreciation of 0.1% in 2007. In 2007 we held short-term investment instruments which were indexed to SCC Common Stock prices and other instruments leveraged and indexed to certain bond pools. These instruments were not principal protected and were deemed to contain embedded derivatives. Related to these embedded derivatives we lost $81.0 million in 2007 which was recorded as “Loss on derivative instruments” in the consolidated statement of earnings. The total amount of these investment instruments was liquidated during the course of 2007. We did not hold these types of instruments in 2008. For a further discussion please see Note 16 “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. 100 Table of Contents Other income (expense) Other income (expense) in 2008 was $17.2 million compared to $30.8 million in 2007. The decrease of $13.6 million in income was attributable to $8.8 million of lower income at our Peruvian operations and $4.8 million at our Mexican operations. The decrease in income at our Peruvian operation was mainly due to a $10.3 million loss on a mark to market valuation of short-term investments, net of an increase in income of $1.5 million on miscellaneous sales. The decrease in income at our Mexican operation was mainly due to a loss of $12.4 million on the sale of investments, net of $3.9 million of tax recoveries, other than income tax. Also 2008, includes a $2.6 million loss on asset disposals. Income taxes Income taxes in 2008 were $679.3 million and include $724.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $45.0 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2007 were $1,185.3 million and include $1.153.8 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $31.5 million for U.S. Federal and state income taxes. US income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The decrease of $506.0 million or 42.7% was primarily due to $1,318.1 million of lower pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.5%, compared with 34.8% in 2007. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions due to a settlement with the IRS. Please see Note 8 “Income taxes” for further discussion of the settlement. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2008 was $7.9 million compared with $10.2 million in 2007, a decrease of $2.3 million or 23.1%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2008 was $1,406.6 million, compared with $2,216.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $809.8 million or 36.5%. Net income attributable to SCC decreased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2008 vs.2007: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 2,803.2 $ 3,192.9 $ (389.7 ) (12.2 ) Operating costs and expenses (1,273.0 ) (1,216.3 ) (56.7 ) (4.7 ) Operating income $ 1,530.2 $ 1,976.6 $ (446.4 ) (22.6 ) Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2008 were $2,803.2 million, compared with $3,192.9 million in 2007, a decrease of $389.7 million. This decrease was principally due to the price decline of copper and molybdenum late in 2008. While the LME copper price was 2.2% lower in 2008 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower. The reduction to sales was magnified, since the prices of the metals dropped sharply in 101 Table of Contents the fourth quarter of 2008. This occurred since much of our sales of copper and molybdenum take final pricing in months subsequent to shipment. The effect of provisional price adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2008 reduced sales by $330.3 million. Additionally, in 2008 copper, molybdenum and silver sales volume decreased by 25.6 million pounds, 1.5 million pounds and 0.9 million ounces, respectively. The decrease in copper sales was mainly due to lower ore grades and recoveries at the Toquepala mine. The decrease in molybdenum sales volume was due to lower production mainly from the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grade. Net sales in 2008 also include a gain on copper derivatives of $91.8 million compared with a gain of $5.5 million in 2007. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2008 were $1,273.0 million, compared with $1,216.3 million in 2007, an increase of $56.7 million principally due to higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,100.4 million in 2008, compared with $1,045.2 million in 2007. The increase of $55.2 million was primarily the result of 1)$192.6 million of higher production cost mainly due to $118.0 million of higher fuel and power cost due to higher market prices and $62.3 million of higher labor cost due to new labor agreements and the appreciation of the Peruvian nuevo sol during part of the year. These increases were partially offset by 2) $104.6 million of lower copper concentrates purchased from third parties, 3) $17.1 million of lower workers’ participation due to lower earnings, and 4)$8.9 million of lower mining royalties due to lower metal prices. Operating income in 2008 was $1,530.2 million, compared with $1,976.6 million in 2007, a decrease of $446.4 million. The operating income increased primarily as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 1,583.6 $ 2,225.1 $ (641.5 ) (28.8 ) Operating costs and expenses (949.5 ) (954.4 ) 4.9 0.5 Operating income $ 634.1 $ 1,270.7 $ (636.6 ) (50.1 ) Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2008 were $1,583.6 million, compared with $2,225.1 million in 2007, a decrease of $641.5 million or 28.8%. This decrease is a result of lower metal prices and lower copper sales volume, mainly refined and rod, due to the loss of production as a result of the ongoing strike activity at the Cananea mine. While the COMEX copper price was 2.8% lower in 2008 (the majority of sales of our Mexican operations’ copper are priced on COMEX) and the molybdenum price was 5.0% lower, the effect of provisional price adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2008 reduced sales by $76.4 million. Partially offsetting this reduction, net sales in 2008 included a gain on copper derivatives of $45.2 million compared with a gain of $5.5 million in 2007. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2008 was $949.5 million compared with $954.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $4.9 million. This decrease was the result of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2008 of $7.7 million, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher depreciation amortization and depletion due to higher amortization of capitalized leach material and $0.9 million of higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was primarily the effect of the ongoing strike at the Cananea mine and is explained by 1) $56.4 million of lower production cost, 2) $62.0 102 Table of Contents million of lower workers’ participation, 3) $17.6 million of lower inventory consumption partially offset by 4)$99.0 million of higher metals purchased from third parties, 5)$28.0 million of continuing cost at the Cananea mine and 6) $14.0 million of severance payments. Operating income in 2008 was $634.1 million, compared with $1,270.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $636.6 million or 50.1%. The operating income increased primarily as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA Unit. Change 2008 2007 Value % Net sales $ 525.1 $ 680.7 $ (155.6 ) (22.9 ) Operating costs and expenses (513.3 ) (434.3 ) (79.0 ) 18.2 Operating income $ 11.8 $ 246.4 $ (234.6 ) (95.2 ) Net sales at our IMMSA Unit in 2008 were $525.1 million, compared with $680.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $155.6 million or 22.9%. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to lower sales volume caused by strikes at the Taxco and San Martin mines and lower zinc prices. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA Unit were $513.3 million in 2008, compared with $434.3 million in 2007, an increase of $79.0 million or 18.2%. This increase was primarily the result of $86.3 million of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), partially offset by $4.9 million of lower depreciation, amortization and depletion, the effect of the accelerated depreciation taken in 2007 on the processing plant equipment at Pasta de Conchos as a result of the mine accident and $3.7 million of lower selling, general and administrative expenses due to lower consultant and support services. The increase in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was principally the result of 1) $82.4 million of higher metal purchased from third parties to partially cover the production loss due to the strikes, 2) $38.0 million of loss in currency translation due to the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, 3) $9.1 million of higher fuel and power cost due to increased market prices, 4) $8.6 million of higher drilling and field work at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines and 5)$11.4 million of contractor services for operations due to higher production of coal and coke in Nueva Rosita south pit. These increases were partially offset by 1) $21.2 million of lower workers’ participation, 2)$15.0 million for an insurance reimbursement for the zinc refinery fire in 2007, 3) $13.1 million of use of inventory and 4) $8.1 million of lower tolling cost due to termination of the contract in May 2008. Operating income in 2008 was $11.8 million, compared with $246.4 million in 2007, a decrease of $234.6 million or 95.2%. The operating income decreased primarily as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. 103 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009. Liquidity The following table shows the cash flow for the years ended 2009 and 2008 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 963.2 $ 1,728.3 $ 2,703.5 Net cash used for investing activities $ (359.3 ) $ (418.6 ) $ (246.0 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (458.0 ) $ (2,048.0 ) $ (2,088.3 ) Net cash provided from operating activities: 2009-2008 The decrease of $765.2 million in the 2009 cash provided from operating activities from 2008 was due to the reduction of $479.9 million in net income and an increase in working capital needs of $355.8 million. The reduction in net income was primarily due to lower metal prices. In 2009 net income was $934.6 million, approximately 97% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items (deducted from), or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $322.6 million and $41.2 million of deferred income tax, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and ($56.8) million of the realized 2008 loss on derivative instruments, which were deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2009 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $286.1 million. The 2009 and 2008 increase (decrease) in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2009 2008 Variance Accounts receivable $ (299.6 ) $ 330.1 $ (629.7 ) Inventories (4.5 ) (3.3 ) (1.2 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (89.1 ) (164.3 ) 75.2 Other operating assets and liabilities 107.1 (92.9 ) 200.0 Total $ (286.1 ) $ 69.6 $ (355.7 ) The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher metal prices at the end of 2009 compared with 2008. The LME and COMEX copper prices increased by over 70% in the fourth quarter 2009 compared with the fourth quarter 2008, and zinc and silver increased by 85.2% and 73.0%, respectively. The increase in inventories of $4.5 million includes an increase of $23.8 million in metal inventory mainly due to higher metal purchases from third parties at our Mexican operations to reduce the production loss caused by the ongoing strikes net of a decrease of $19.2 million in supplies inventory. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to a decrease in accounts payable trade as a result of the lower prices of supplies and the strikes at our Mexican operations. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2009 were a source of cash of $107.1 million, which was caused principally by a decrease of $44.1 million in the long term income tax provision. 104 Table of Contents 2008-2007 The decrease of $975.1 million in the 2008 cash provided from operating activities from 2007 was principally due to the reduction of $812.1 million in net income as a result of lower sales prices for most of our metal products and a decrease in sales volume. In 2008 net income was $1,414.5 million approximately 81.8% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items (deducted from), or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $327.3 million and $56.8 million of unrealized loss on derivative instruments, which increased operating cash flow, and deferred income tax benefit of $100.1 million, which decreased operating cash flow. In addition, in 2008 a decrease in working capital increased operating cash flow by $69.6 million. The 2008 and 2007 increase in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2008 2007 Variance Accounts receivable $ 330.1 $ 66.2 $ 263.9 Inventories (3.3 ) (34.6 ) 31.3 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (164.3 ) (150.3 ) (14.0 ) Other operating assets and liabilities (92.9 ) 153.7 (246.6 ) Total $ 69.6 $ 35.0 $ (34.6 ) The decrease in accounts receivable was principally caused by the sharp decrease in metal prices at the end of 2008. The fourth quarter 2008 price of copper and molybdenum was approximately 46% and 55% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the year-end 2008 price of copper and molybdenum was approximately 55% and 70% lower than the year-end 2007 prices. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $164.3 million in 2008, largely as a result of a decrease in workers’ participation and income tax accruals of $107.8 million and $97.8 million, respectively, as a result of lower earnings in 2008. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2008 were a use of cash of $92.9 million which was caused principally by a decrease of $84.5 million in the long-term income tax provision, see Note 8 — “Income Taxes”, of our consolidated financial statements. In 2007, our earnings were $2,216.4 million, approximately 82.0% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items deducted from, or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $327.9 million, $81.0 million of realized loss on short-term investments and $66.6 million of deferred income tax, which positively increased operating cash flow and $45.9 million of capitalized leachable material, which lowered our cash flow. Additionally, a decrease in working capital needs increased operating cash flow by $34.9 million. Net cash used for investing activities: 2009: Net cash used for investing activities in 2009 included $414.8 million for capital expenditures, $43.8 million of proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments and $11.8 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties in our Mexican operations. The capital expenditures included $284.4 million of investments at our Peruvian operations, $162.0 million for the Tia Maria project, $52.6 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, and $69.8 million for various other replacement expenditures. In addition, we spent $130.4 million for replacement assets at our Mexican operations, $79.4 million of which was at our Mexican open-pit 105 Table of Contents operations, $27.8 million at our IMMSA Unit and $23.2 million at our administrative office in Mexico City. 2008: Net cash used for investing activities included $524.4 million of capital expenditures, $45.2 million received from the redemption of short-term investments and $60.6 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties at our Mexican operations. The $524.4 million of capital expenditures includes the following expenditures at our Peruvian operations, $118.0 million for the Tia Maria project, $37.7 million for the Toquepala expansion project, $18.2 million for the Cuajone expansion project, $21.7 million for the tailing disposal project, $17.3 million for electrical shovels and $89.5 for equipment replacement and upgrades. Capital expenditures also include equipment replacement and upgrade of $145.0 million at our Mexican open-pit operations, $44.2 million at our IMMSA Unit and $32.8 million for our administrative office in Mexico. 2007: Net cash used for investing activities was $246.0 million and included $315.7 million of capital expenditures, $217.9 million for the purchase of short-term investments, less $287.4 million received on the redemption of short-term investments. The $315.7 million of capital expenditures, includes $21.0 million for the Ilo smelter modernization project, $13.8 million for the Toquepala leach dump project, $10.5 million for the PLS dam project and $270.4 million for equipment replacements and upgrades of which $188.6 million was for our Mexican operations. Net cash used for financing activities: 2009: Net cash used for financing activities amounted to $458.0 million, and included a shareholder dividend distribution of $376.0 million, a distribution to our non-controlling interest investors of $1.1 million, $71.9 million for the repurchase of 4.9 million shares of our Common Stock and $10.0 million for debt payment. 2008: Net cash used for financing activities amounted to $2,048.0 million, and included a shareholder dividend distribution of $1,710.8 million, a distribution to our non-controlling interest investors of $10.2 million, $384.7 million for the repurchase of 28.5 million shares of our Common Stock and $160.0 million of debt repayment. In addition, we received $216.4 million from the sale of 350 million shares of our parent company’s Common Stock. See Note 15 “Stockholder Equity.” 2007: cash used for financing activities amounted $2,088.3 million, mainly for a dividend distribution of $2,002.3 million to our shareholders and $7.2 million to our non-controlling interest investors. In 2007, financing activities also include $68.6 million for the repurchase of our Yankee bonds series B and a $10.0 million payment on the Mitsui loan. Other Liquidity Considerations In 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an up to $500 million share repurchase program. Under this program we may purchase shares from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. In 2009 the Company purchased 4.9 million shares of its Common Stock at a cost of $71.9 million. In 2008, we purchased 28.5 million shares under this program at a cost of $384.7 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. On January 28, 2010 the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of 43 cents per share to be paid on March 4, 2010 to shareholders of record as of February 19, 2010. Our dividend policy continues to be reviewed at Board of Directors’ meetings, taking into 106 Table of Contents consideration the current capital investment program and expected future cash flow generated from operations. We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2010 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. In December 2006, our Peruvian Branch signed a contract with the Peruvian government committing our Company to make annual contributions for five years to support the regional development of Peru. The contributions are being used for social benefit programs. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company made non-deductible contributions of $12.7 million, $18.9 million and $16.1 million out of 2008, 2007 and 2006 earnings, respectively and has charged 2009 earnings $9.1 million for the 2010 contribution. Future contributions could increase or decrease depending on earnings and copper prices. If the average annual LME copper price is below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. In June 2004, the Peruvian Congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies. Under this law, we are subject to a 1% to 3% charge, based on sales, applicable to the value of the concentrates produced. We made a provision of $43.7 million, $53.9 million and $62.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, for this charge. During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we made payments of $38.4 million, $58.0 million and $64.0 million, respectively, related to this charge. FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2009 was $1,296.4 million compared with $1,306.4 million at December 31, 2008 before the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $16.1 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $10.0 million decrease in 2009 was for a scheduled repayment on our Mitsui loan. The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 24.7% at December 31, 2009, compared with 27.5% at December 31, 2008. Also, the ratio of net debt to total capitalization was 11.6% at December 31, 2009 compared with 14.5% at December 31, 2008. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We use the net debt to capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities and equity. Capital Expenditure Programs A discussion of our capital expenditure programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Expansion Program” under this Item 7. 107 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments due by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 1,296.4 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ — $ 1,256.4 Interest on debt 2,087.3 93.9 93.6 93.4 93.1 93.0 1,620.3 Uncertain tax position(a) 26.2 Workers’ participation 150.9 150.9 Contribution to the Peruvian regional development 9.1 9.1 Pension and post-retirement obligations 98.5 31.0 5.6 5.8 6.1 6.4 43.6 Asset retirement obligation 267.3 — — — — — 267.3 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,228.6 167.5 167.6 167.5 167.6 167.5 390.9 Capital expenditure projects 228.0 228.0 — — — — — Total $ 5,392.3 $ 690.4 $ 276.8 $ 276.7 $ 276.8 $ 266.9 $ 3,578.5 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2009 the liability recognized by the Company is $26.2 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2009. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a workers salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pursuant to our agreement with the Peruvian Government signed on December 28, 2006 we have committed to make annual contributions for five years for the regional development of Peru based on Peruvian Branch’s earnings after income tax. Future contributions could increase or decrease depending on copper prices. The commitment of the Peruvian Branch is for a total of 1.25% of its annual earnings, after Peruvian income tax. If the average annual LME copper price drops below $1.79 per pound the contribution will cease. For an additional discussion on this matter please see “Regional development contribution” in Note 14 “Commitments and contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefit expected to be paid under our post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit plans” of our consolidated financial statements. 108 Table of Contents Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MEM. See note 10 “Asset retirement obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. In 2009 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Enersur regarding the power supply agreement. As a result of the MOU, formulas for calculating the monthly power cost have changed, decreasing power cost vis a vis the former methodology. The new formula has been applied since May 2009 to date and will be used until the end of the contract in 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs as amended by the MOU, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Peruvian projects of Tia Maria and the Toquepala concentrator expansion.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based upon our indebtedness at December 31, 2009, a change in interest rates of one percent (or 100 basis points) would have an average annual impact on net income and cash flows of $0.2 million. Most of our debt is at fixed rates. We are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. To manage the volatility related to the risk, we may enter into forward exchange contracts, currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 0.2 % 6.6 % 3.9 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (8.0 )% 4.8 % (6.3 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.6 % 6.5 % 3.8 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (3.5 )% 24.5 % (0.1 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate change of 10% at December 31, 2009, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our operating income as follows: Variance Effect in net earnings ($ in million) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 36.2 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (29.6 ) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 26.1 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (21.3 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2009. Metal price sensitivity: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price 110 Table of Contents sensitivity factors would indicate estimated changes in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2010 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver – per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 5.7 $ 22.1 $ 1.3 $ 9.5 We occasionally use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rate and exchange rate risk exposures. We generally do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposing our Company to market risk. Copper and zinc swaps: In 2009 we did not enter into any copper or zinc derivative contracts. During 2008 and 2007 we entered into copper collar and swap contracts to protect a portion of our sales of copper production as follows: 2008 2007 Collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) 220.5 170.5 Average LME cap price $ 4.23 $ 4.07 Average LME floor price $ 3.40 $ 3.20 Swap contracts: Pounds (in millions) 175.1 11.9 Weighted average COMEX price $ 3.87 $ 3.71 Gain on copper derivatives $ 137.0 $ 10.9 The gains obtained were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, these gains were recorded in net earnings in operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash flow. Transactions under these metal price protection programs are not accounted for as hedges under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging-embedded derivatives” (formerly SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities”) and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Gas swaps: In the last three years we entered into gas swap contracts to protect part of our gas consumption as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Gas volume (MMBTUs) 306,000 460,000 900,000 Fixed price $ 3.6350 $ 8.2175 $ 7.5250 Loss (in millions) — $ (0.9 ) $ (0.9 ) The losses obtained were included in the production cost. At December 31, 2009 we did not hold any gas contract positions. 111 Table of Contents Exchange Rate Derivatives, U.S. dollar / Mexican peso contracts: Because more than 85% of our sales collections in Mexico are in US dollars and many of our costs are in Mexican pesos, we entered into zero-cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting, within a range, against an appreciation of the Mexican peso to the US dollar. Related to the exchange rate derivative contracts we recorded gains and (losses) as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Gain (loss) $ 4.2 $ (74.6 ) $ 8.6 These gains and losses were recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2009 we did not hold any exchange rate derivative contracts. Dual currency notes: We did not hold any dual currency notes in 2009 and 2008. However, in 2007 we recorded an exchange loss of $1.3 million which was recorded as loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of earnings and earned interest of $2.1 million, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Short-term investments: Short-term investments were as follows: As of December 31, Investments 2009 2008 Short-term investments in securities issued by public companies (in millions) $ 22.9 $ 62.4 Weighted average interest rate 0.63 % 1.85 % Short-term investments consist of securities issued by public companies, which have been classified as available for sale. Each security is independent of the others. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were not material. Related to these investments we earned interest which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Also we redeemed some of these securities and obtained gains (losses) due to changes in fair value, which were recorded as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 contractual maturities of debt securities are as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 One year or less $ 9.0 $ 23.6 Maturing after one year through five years 4.1 24.8 Maturing after five years through ten years 0.1 1.5 Due after ten years 9.7 12.5 Total debt securities $ 22.9 $ 62.4 112 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the activity of these investments (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Interest earned $ 0.4 $ 4.1 Investment redeemed $ 43.8 $ 45.2 Loss recognized for other than temporary declines — $ 10.3 IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS None 113 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:19.061001

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us, including our Minera Mexico subsidiary, on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business” - “Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile. In addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2010 approximately 73% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 13% from molybdenum, 6% from silver and 8% from various other products, including zinc, gold and other materials. We believe that our greatest strength lies in our copper ore reserves, which at December 31, 2010 totaled 59.7 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $1.80 per pound (as of December 31, 2010 the LME and COMEX copper price was $4.42). In terms of copper reserves, we believe we hold the world’s largest reserve position. Our other significant strengths include our asset quality, our low cost leadership in the industry and our prudent financial policies, which are reflected in our financial performance. AMC — Business Combination Proposal: In July 2010, we received a proposal from AMC, our parent company and the parent company of Asarco, offering to effect an all stock business combination of our Company and AMC. A special committee formed from our independent directors is evaluating this proposal. Please see Note 2 to our financial statements, for further information. 79 Table of Contents Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · In 2010, we finally solved the illegal work stoppage at Cananea that had been plaguing our Mexican operations since 2007. To reflect what we believe is a new beginning for this property, we have renamed the entity Buenavista del Cobre or Buenavista. SXEW production at this property reached capacity in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we expect to reach full concentrator capacity in the first quarter of 2011. · Changes in copper and molybdenum prices. Copper represents about 73% of our sales. Molybdenum, our most significant by-product, represents about 13% of our sales. We believe the market for copper in 2011 will be in deficit as increased demand will exceed increases in supply. In addition, we are expecting a balanced market for molybdenum. · We expect that the 2011 production of copper will be approximately 630,000 tons, an increase of 26% over 2010. This estimate includes the restoration of Buenavista’s production at full capacity after the first quarter 2011 and the processing of third party concentrates. · We expect molybdenum production in 2011 to be about 17,000 tons, a decrease from 2010 production due to a 9% decrease in production at our Peruvian mines because of a temporary decrease in ore grades. · In 2011, we will continue with our capital investment program. We have budgeted $1.7 billion in spending for the year. Spending in Peru is estimated to be $862 million and in Mexico $881 million. This investment is part of our five year capital expenditure program to increase production of copper and molybdenum. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2010: 2010 2009 2008 Net sales (in millions) $ 5,150 $ 3,734 $ 4,851 Net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 1,554 $ 929 $ 1,407 Earnings per share $ 1.83 $ 1.09 $ 1.60 Dividends per share $ 1.68 $ 0.44 $ 1.94 Average LME copper price $ 3.42 $ 2.34 $ 3.16 Pounds of copper sold (in millions) 1,106 1,118 1,115 Sales and net income increased significantly in 2010 from the prior year. Prices of copper and our principal by-products were all higher in 2010 and were trending higher at year end. The 2010 sales volumes were generally lower for most of our products, copper was 1% lower than the prior year and silver and zinc were lower by 15% and 9.5%, respectively. Molybdenum sales volume, however, was over 10% higher in 2010 than the prior year, offsetting much of the decrease caused by the lower volume of other metals. Earnings increased by 67% in 2010 as a result of the increase in metal prices. Metal prices for the first month of 2011 continued to improve and we are confident that the outlook for 2011 is promising. However, while we believe that the market fundamentals for copper are strong, some caution should be exercised. Current copper inventories in the principal warehouses have increased in recent months and there exists strong price volatility in the metals market and particularly in copper. Considering this, as well as our large capital investment program, we have put in place a significant price protection program for 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. Please see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, “Copper Swaps”, on page 112 for more detailed information related to this price protection. 80 Table of Contents Production: The table below highlights key mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2010: 2010 2009 2008 Copper mined (in million pounds) 1,055 1,070 1,078 Molybdenum mined (in million pounds) 45 41 36 Zinc mined (in million pounds) 219 243 236 Silver mined (in million ounces) 13 13 12 Copper mined in 2010 was 15 million pounds under the 2009 copper mine production. A net decrease at our Peruvian mines of 43 million pounds, largely from lower grade at the Cuajone mine and a decrease of 17 million pounds from La Caridad mine, due to lower grades and recoveries, were partially offset by 46 million pounds of SXEW production from the Buenavista mine, which began restoring operations in the second half of 2010. Full capacity is expected to be reached by the end of the first quarter of 2011. This includes concentrate production along with our SXEW production. In 2009, Buenavista was completely shutdown. Molybdenum production reached a record level in 2010. Production increased by approximately 4 million pounds in 2010 due primarily to grade and recovery increases at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. Zinc production, which comes from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, decreased by 24 million pounds in 2010 due principally to the lower production at the Santa Eulalia mine as a result of unusually heavy rains, which caused flooding in the area and disrupted production. We have a rehabilitation program for Santa Eulalia, which includes a pumping system with a total budget of $12.9 million. We expect to restore full mine production by October 2011. Our silver production decreased 4.2% in 2010, due to decreases at our operations in Mexico and Peru. Copper mined in 2009 was about 8 million pounds under the 2008 copper mine production. A net increase at our Peruvian mines of 11 million pounds, largely from improved recovery and higher grade at the Toquepala mine, plus an increase of 15 million pounds from La Caridad mine, due to higher recoveries and grades, was offset by production losses due to the Buenavista strike. In 2008, we were able to produce 34 million of copper at Buenavista during the early part of the year. In 2009, Buenavista was completely shutdown. Molybdenum production increased by approximately 5 million pounds in 2009 due primarily to an increase of approximately 5 million pounds at La Caridad, due to grade and recovery increases. Zinc production, which is from our IMMSA unit, increased by 7 million pounds in 2009. Silver production increased 7.2% in 2009, with increases occurring at our operations in Mexico and Peru. Buenavista mine: Operations at our Buenavista mine are being restored to full capacity after being closed for almost three years because of the strike. Full capacity of SXEW was restored in the fourth quarter 2010 and full capacity of the concentrator is being restored in the first quarter of 2011. Through December 31, 2010 we spent $70.9 million for the rehabilitation of the mine and plant and we expect to spend an additional $43.1 million in 2011. We anticipate that a portion of these costs will be recovered from insurance. The recovery of the Buenavista mine allows us to resume the development of our capital investment projects at the property, which includes a concentrator expansion, a third and a fourth SXEW plants, a molybdenum plant and the Quebalix III, a crushing, spreading and conveying system at the mine. 81 Table of Contents Tia Maria project: In connection with obtaining approval of the EIA of the project, additional information, including the use of sea water, was submitted to the government. On December 1, 2010, MINEM approved a communication plan with new options to use to inform the details of EIA to the local communities. We completed the communication plan in January 2011, which included the opening of three information offices in the communities that would be mostly impacted by the project and we held four informative meetings with citizens of the local communities. In addition, advertisements explaining the project were placed in local newspapers, as well as on local television and radio stations. On February 1, 2011, we filed a report with MINEM indicating full completion of the program. The observation and comment period for the local and community members and other stakeholders, including environmentalist and non-governmental organizations, expires on March 2, 2011 and we expect to receive approval of the EIA during the second quarter of 2011. Construction work is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2011 and copper production will start by the fourth quarter of 2012. Based on the current developments of the project we have performed an impairment analysis of the project assets and we have concluded that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2010. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These include, (i) our “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (ii) metal prices, (iii) business segments, (iv) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (v) our capital investment programs. Operating Cash Costs An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), less the cost of purchased concentrates, plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges, net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties and by-products revenues, and sales premiums, less workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products, principally molybdenum, zinc, silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in silver and zinc, has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. 82 Table of Contents We exclude the cost of purchases of third party copper material. From time to time we purchase copper concentrates on the open market in order to maximize the use of our smelter capacity or to take advantage of an attractive market situation. We view these purchases on an incremental basis and measure the results incrementally. We find that the inclusion of these purchases with our own production often creates a distortion in our unit cost. Accordingly, we include only the net effect of these purchases, so that only the net revenue or loss from the transaction is included in the calculation. We believe this will allow others to see a truer presentation of our cash cost. In addition, we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the royalty charges. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2010. We present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by-product revenues. Year Positive (negative) Variance (Cents per pound) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced 16.8 35.8 21.8 19.0 (14.0 ) Less: by-products revenue 134.1 100.1 135.3 34.0 (35.2 ) Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-products revenue 150.9 135.9 157.1 (15.0 ) 21.2 2010 compared with 2009: As seen on the chart above, our cash cost per pound for 2010 when calculated with by-products revenue is 16.8 cents per pound compared with 35.8 cents per pound in 2009. The increase in the by-products credit in the 2010 period was largely due to higher sales prices for molybdenum, silver and zinc and a record molybdenum production in 2010. The increase in the credit for molybdenum was 29.0 cents per pound in 2010, of which 19.0 cents was due to higher prices. Our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was higher by 15.0 cents per pound in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to an increase of 13.5 cents per pound in production cost, mainly power and fuel cost due to increased market prices, labor due to salary increases, local currency appreciation and repair costs. 2009 compared with 2008: As seen on the chart above, our cash cost per pound for 2009 when calculated with by-products revenue is 35.8 cents per pound compared with 21.8 cents per pound in 2008. The decrease in the by-products credit in the 2009 period was largely due to lower molybdenum prices. The effect of lower molybdenum prices reduced the by-products credit by approximately 30.7 cents per pound for 2009. Our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was lower by 21.2 cents per pound in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decrease of 19.4 cents per pound in production cost as result of the modernization of our equipment and the lower power and fuel cost, which decreased cash cost by 15.9 cents. 83 Table of Contents Metal Prices The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to speculative activities. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to actual or potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2011 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 7.6 $ 21.1 $ 1.1 $ 7.7 Business Segments We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and the Buenavista mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and a zinc refinery. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 21 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Devaluation of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. 84 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 2.1 % 0.2 % 6.6 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (2.8 )% (8.0 )% 4.8 % Mexico Mexican inflation rate 4.4 % 3.6 % 6.5 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (5.4 )% (3.5 )% 24.5 % Capital Investment Program We made capital expenditures of $408.7 million, $414.8 million and $524.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In general, the capital expenditures and investment projects described below are intended to increase production and/or decrease costs. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Peruvian projects: Tia Maria — Arequipa $ 152.5 $ 162.0 $ 118.0 Toquepala concentrator expansion 32.8 52.6 37.7 Cuajone concentrator expansion 18.8 4.3 18.2 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 3.3 5.6 21.7 Ilo smelter modernization (including marine trestle) 1.6 10.2 6.6 Sub-total projects 209.0 234.7 202.2 Maintenance and replacement 55.2 49.7 100.3 Total Peruvian expenditures 264.2 284.4 302.5 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine rehabilitation and benefit plant 35.0 — — El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 14.1 10.4 3.9 La Caridad tailings dam — Internal dikes 4.3 2.2 2.1 Santa Eulalia pumping system 3.2 0.6 — La Caridad concentrator plant expansion 0.3 0.2 — Pilares mine (including land acquisition) 0.2 0.7 20.0 Buenavista SXEW plant II 0.4 — — Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material, phases I and II 0.4 — 13.6 La Caridad crusher high efficiency system — — 2.8 San Luis Potosi effluent plant — 4.9 — Sub-total projects 57.9 19.0 42.4 Maintenance and replacement 86.7 111.4 179.5 Total Mexican expenditures 144.6 130.4 221.9 Total capital expenditures $ 408.8 $ 414.8 $ 524.4 We are committed to continuing the growth of our Company. In 2011, we will continue with our capital investment program. We have budgeted $1.7 billion in spending for the year. Spending in Peru is estimated to be $862 million and in Mexico $881 million. This investment is part of our five year capital investment program to increase production of copper and molybdenum. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in the economy or market conditions. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. 85 Table of Contents Peruvian operations: Tia Maria project: This project, located in the Peruvian region of Arequipa, is expected to produce about 260 million pounds of SXEW copper cathodes per year. In connection with obtaining approval of the EIA of the project, additional information, including the use of sea water, was submitted to the government. On December 1, 2010, MINEM approved a communication plan with new options to use to inform the details of EIA to the local communities. We completed the communication plan in January 2011, which included the opening of three information offices in the communities that would be mostly impacted by the project and we held four informative meetings with citizens of the local communities. In addition, advertisements explaining the project were placed in local newspapers, as well as on local television and radio stations. On February 1, 2011, we filed a report with MINEM indicating full completion of the program. The observation and comment period for the local and community members and other stakeholders, including environmentalist and non-governmental organizations, expires on March 2, 2011 and we expect to receive approval of the EIA during the second quarter of 2011. Construction work is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2011 and copper production is expected to start by the fourth quarter of 2012. Current investment in the project is focused on the development of engineering studies for the mine facilities and on the purchase of equipment for copper extraction processes. We estimate a total investment of $934.0 million of which $432.5 million was spent through December 31, 2010. Toquepala concentrator expansion: Through 2010, we have spent a total of $123.1 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion. The approval of the use of high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) and wet screening at the tertiary crushing stage will reduce capital and operating cost. The scope of the project is currently under review as we are evaluating an increase in milling capacity of 60,000 tons per day from the 40,000 tons per day originally planned. As a result of this review, the EIA is expected to be presented during the second quarter of 2011 and the project start-up in the first half of 2013. Cuajone concentrator expansion: This project will expand the concentrator to process 105,000 tons per day and has a total capital budget of $301 million, of which we have spent $41.3 million through December 31, 2010. Increased production from this expansion project will begin in the second half of 2011. The purchase of mine and auxiliary equipment to support the work to optimize the Cuajone mine plan is in progress. As part of the expansion plans, the project contemplates a variable cut-off grade methodology, which will increase copper and molybdenum production by a total of 147,000 tons and 3,000 tons, respectively, in the next 10 years. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project will increase the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 35 years. The first stage of the tailings disposal project was completed. Construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam started in June 2010. The project has a total cost of $66 million with $47.0 million expended through December 31, 2010. Ilo smelter modernization: In May 2010, the Ilo smelter marine trestle, with a total cost of $25.3 million, started operation. We now offload directly to offshore ships the sulfuric acid produced at the Ilo smelter, avoiding hauling cargo through the city of Ilo. The 500 meter long marine trestle is the last component of the Ilo smelter modernization project. 86 Table of Contents Mexican operations: Buenavista SXEW plant III: In the second half of 2010, we restarted the project and in December 2010 we completed a review of the basic engineering. We have started the detailed engineering in January 2011 and, when completed, we will begin the acquisition of major equipment and construction of the plant and new infrastructure. The total budget for this project is $216 million, of which we have spent $1.9 million through December 31, 2010. Crushing, conveying and spreading system (“Quebalix III”): In 2010 the project has also been restarted. We have almost completed the acquisition of the project equipment and will begin construction of the crusher building and the conveying and spreading systems for the leachable ore. We expect a total investment of $70 million, of which we have spent $32.9 million through December 31, 2010. Buenavista molybdenum plant: The basic engineering for the project is in process and we expect it to be completed during the first quarter of 2011. Further, we will complete the metallurgical testing and start the detailed engineering and the procurement of the main equipment. Pilares project: The Pilares mine site is located close to the La Caridad mine and is being evaluated. As of December 31 2010, 13,700 meters of drilling has been performed, access roads developed and metallurgical testing and preliminary mine planning has begun. Social programs for the Buenavista community are underway. The local hospital has been reconstructed, two new water wells for the community have been completed, as well as a street paving program, and the town library was provided with modern technology to improve reference search capabilities. Other capital expenditures Tantahuatay: The construction of the Tantahuatay gold project, in which we have an 44.25% participation with Compania de Minas Buenaventura, has advanced and is expected to start dore gold production by June 2011. The project is expected to have an average annual production of 90,000 ounces of gold and about 426,000 ounces of silver, for five years. It will require a total investment of $110 million. During 2011, we will continue to assess the underlying copper deposit for possible future development. El Arco: El Arco is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with estimated mineralized material of over 1.0 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.51% and 14 grams of gold per ton. This project is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. We continue to invest in land acquisition required for the project. In 2010, the project feasibility study was completed at a cost of $15.0 million. Potential projects We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return, environmental needs, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. 87 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $1.80 per pound for copper and $11.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term. Our management uses these price assumptions, as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $2.97 per pound for copper and $18.59 per pound for molybdenum, both current average prices as of December 31, 2010. The prices for copper and molybdenum were $2.90 and $23.44, respectively, as of December 31, 2009 and $3.15 and $28.02, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. However, variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions do not create material changes to our financial results. Leachable Material: At one of our Mexican mines, we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process (leachable material), which is collected in leach dumps. The capitalized cost is recognized in earnings over the period we expect to recover copper from the leach dumps, which is estimated to be five years. 88 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 11 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix fuel prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates and currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar conversion rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings as follows: copper and zinc derivatives are included in net sales, gain and losses related to fuel costs are included in cost of sales and all other are included in “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments.” Changes in the fair value of copper derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in sales as the hedged copper sales occur. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. 89 Table of Contents A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Tax” (FIN 48 “Uncertain tax positions” in prior literature) to record these liabilities. (See Note 9 “Income taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $1.80 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $11.00 per pound, along with near-term price forecast, for 2010, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $1.50 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $10.00 per pound, showed projected undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.2 to 4.2 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. 90 Table of Contents PROVISIONALLY PRICED SALES The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Provisionally Priced Sales 2010 2009 2008 Copper Millions of pounds 13.8 23.4 141.0 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 4.38 $ 3.33 $ 1.39 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 9.1 10.9 6.3 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 16.40 $ 11.75 $ 9.50 Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Provisional Sales Adjustments 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Copper $ 4.8 $ 4.1 $ (44.2 ) Molybdenum 7.3 (16.2 ) (53.1 ) Total $ 12.1 $ (12.1 ) $ (97.3 ) Management believes that the final pricing of these sales will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

SEGMENT SALES INFORMATION The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2010: Copper Sales (million pounds) 2010 2009 2008 Peruvian operations 792.4 808.4 762.2 Mexican open-pit 311.7 289.0 321.9 Mexican IMMSA unit 23.0 34.6 35.4 Other and intersegment elimination (21.0 ) (14.2 ) (5.0 ) Total copper sales 1,106.1 1,117.8 1,114.5 By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver - million ounces) 2010 2009 2008 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 22.3 19.6 20.4 Silver 4.5 4.3 3.8 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 22.9 21.4 16.0 Silver 7.1 6.5 4.4 IMMSA unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 215.1 228.0 220.7 Silver 7.0 12.3 8.9 Other and intersegment elimination Zinc (7.9 ) 0.9 0.5 Silver (3.2 ) (4.9 ) (2.1 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 45.2 41.0 36.4 Zinc-refined and in concentrate 207.2 228.9 221.2 Silver 15.4 18.2 15.0 92 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009. Net sales Net sales in 2010 were $5,149.5 million, compared with $3,734.3 million in 2009, an increase of $1,415.2 million. The increase was principally a result of higher average metal prices and higher molybdenum sales volume. Molybdenum sales volume increased 10.5%, following a production record in 2010 due primarily to grade and recovery increases at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. The increase in metal prices was a result of improvements in the global economy and, in the case of copper, was helped by increased demand from China. Net sales in 2010 include a loss of $41.9 million on copper hedges. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2010 and 2009. Copper Sales by product (million pounds) 2010 2009 Refined 637.2 692.4 Blister — 40.0 Anode 38.6 30.8 Concentrates and other 135.2 94.2 SXEW 167.4 126.0 Rod 127.7 134.4 Total 1,106.1 1,117.8 Mine copper production was 1,055.0 million pounds in 2010, a decrease of 1.4% from 2009. This decrease of 15.1 million pounds included a reduction of 43.2 million pounds at our Peruvian operation, principally from the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades net of an increase of 28.0 million pounds at our Mexican open-pit mines. The increase was mainly due to 45.6 million pounds of SXEW cathodes from our Buenavista mine, which restored full leach capacity during the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a decrease of 16.8 million pounds at La Caridad mine due to lower ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production reached a record of 45.2 million pounds in 2010, a 9.8% increase from 2009. This increase was principally due to higher ore grades at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. Mine zinc production amounted to 218.7 million pounds in 2010, a 10.2% decrease from 2009. The decrease of 24.8 million pounds in zinc production is principally the result of lower production at the Santa Eulalia mine due to unusually heavy rains, which caused flooding in the area and hindered production. We are currently working on a rehabilitation program and expect to restore full mine production by October 2011. Copper made up 72.7% of net sales in 2010 compared with 70.7% in 2009. Sales of by-products in 2010 totaled $1,403.7 million compared with $1,095.4 million in 2009, an increase of 28.1%. The increase is principally attributable to the increase in the sales prices for molybdenum, silver and zinc, as well as higher molybdenum sales volume. 93 Table of Contents The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2010 2009 Molybdenum 13.3 % 11.7 % Zinc 4.1 % 4.7 % Silver 6.0 % 7.4 % Other by-products 3.9 % 5.5 % Total 27.3 % 29.3 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2010 was $2,099.4 million, compared with $1,823.7 million in 2009, an increase of $275.7 million, or 15.1%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to 1) higher production cost, including $48.5 million of higher fuel and power cost due to higher market prices, $22.9 million of higher labor cost, including a payment of approximately $10.2 million in signing bonuses to our Peruvian workers, and $21.3 million of higher costs for repairs at our Ilo smelter, 2) $109.6 million of higher workers’ participation as a result of increased earnings, 3) $16.4 million of higher mine royalties due to higher sales value and 4) $35.9 million for the restoration costs at our Buenavista facility. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2010 was $88.3 million, compared with $78.3 million in 2009, an increase of $10.0 million. The increase was mainly due to $3.5 million of higher labor cost, $2.4 million of a currency translation effect due to the revaluation of the Mexican peso. The 2009 administrative expenses include a credit adjustment of $3.5 million to the post retirement benefit plans at our Peruvian operations. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2010 was $34.3 million and included $13.6 million in Peru (including Chile) and $20.7 million in Mexico, compared with $24.6 million in 2009, of which $14.6 million was in Peru and Chile and $10.0 million in Mexico. Exploration expense in Peru decreased $1.0 million mainly at Los Chancas due to the completion of the pre-feasibility studies, partially offset by the exploration at other several minor prospects. Exploration spending in Mexico was $10.7 million higher in 2010 principally due to 1) $7.4 million of higher drilling cost at our IMMSA mines which includes $2.8 million at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines and $4.6 million at the Santa Barbara mine, 2) $2.0 million at the La Caridad mine due to the restart of drilling programs, and 3) $1.1 million due to the acquisition of mining rights and additional field work. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2010 was $160.5 million compared with $97.6 million in 2009, an increase of $62.9 million. Interest expense increased in 2010 as a result of the issuance of $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes at an average rate of 5.4%. Capitalized interest was $7.5 million and $2.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 94 Table of Contents Interest income Interest income in 2010 was $7.8 million, compared with $6.6 million in 2009, an increase of $1.2 million. Our interest income increased as a result of higher average cash balances, principally because of improved earnings and additional borrowings. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments Gain on derivative instruments in 2009 was $4.2 million related to the U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives. The Mexican peso appreciated 3.5% in 2009. We did not hold any exchange rate derivatives in 2010. For a further discussion please see Note 17 “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. Gains or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gains or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $20.7 million in 2010 compared with income of $6.1 million in 2009. The significant items in 2010 that increased the expense in “Other income (expense)” include: 1) an expense in Peru of $14.8 million for the regional development contribution, an increase of $5.6 million over the prior year, attributable to higher profits, 2) a decrease in Peru of $1.4 million related to gains on sale of miscellaneous property, 3) the 2009 period recorded a gain of $1.7 million related to a contract breakage fee received by our Peruvian operations; 2010 did not include any fees of this nature, 4) our Mexican operations included an increase in other miscellaneous charges of $3.8 million which include payments to local municipalities of $1.7 million related to the settlement of the Buenavista (Cananea) strike. In addition donations are included in this category. Income taxes Income taxes in 2010 were $868.1 million and include $838.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $29.8 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2009 were $469.8 million and include $471.0 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $1.2 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The increase of $398.3 million or 84.8% was primarily due to $1,026.4 million of higher pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 35.7%, compared with 33.5% in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate is principally due to an increase in unrecognized tax benefit (UTB)caused by a prior year change in the percentage depletion in the UTB and a decrease to the percentage depletion allowance presently forecasted for 2010 when compared with 2009. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2010 was $8.7 million compared with $5.2 million in 2009, an increase of $3.5 million or 67.3%. This increase is the result of higher earnings at our Peruvian operations. 95 Table of Contents Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2010 was $1,554.0 million, compared with $929.4 million in 2009, an increase of $624.6 million. Net income attributable to SCC increased largely as a result of higher metal prices and the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2010 vs.2009: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 3,125.9 $ 2,223.5 $ 902.4 40.6 % Operating costs and expenses (1,406.1 ) (1,206.2 ) (199.9 ) (16.6 )% Operating income $ 1,719.8 $ 1,017.3 $ 702.5 69.1 % Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2010 were $3,125.9 million compared with $2,223.5 million in 2009, an increase of $902.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the increase in metal prices and an increase in molybdenum and silver sales volume. The LME copper price was 46.2% higher in 2010 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum and silver prices were 43% and 37.6% higher, respectively. Molybdenum and silver sales volume increased by 2.7 million pounds and 0.2 million ounces, respectively. The increase in molybdenum sales volume was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala mine due to higher grades and recoveries. The increase in silver sales volume was due to higher production at the Toquepala mine. Net sales in 2010 also include a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $27.7 million while in 2009 we held no copper derivatives positions. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2010 were $1,406.1 million, compared with $1,206.2 million in 2009, an increase of $199.9 million principally due to higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,218.2 million in 2010, compared with $1,026.7 million in 2009. The increase of $191.5 million was primarily the result of 1) $80.6 million of higher production cost principally due to $18.3 million of higher cost of fuel and power due to an increase in market prices, $20.7 million of higher labor cost, including a payment of approximately $10.2 million in signing bonuses to our Peruvian workers, and $41.6 million of operating and repair cost mainly due to repairs at our Ilo smelter plant, 2) $21.9 million of higher royalty charge and 3) $74.7 million of higher workers’ participation. The increases in royalty charge and the workers’ participation are both due to higher earnings. Operating income in 2010 was $1,719.8 million, compared with $1,017.3 million in 2009, an increase of $702.5 million. Operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 1,648.5 $ 1,076.7 $ 571.8 53.1 % Operating costs and expenses (910.3 ) (745.7 ) (164.6 ) (22.1 )% Operating income $ 738.2 $ 331.0 $ 407.2 123.0 % 96 Table of Contents Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2010 were $1,648.5 million, compared with $1,076.7 million in 2009, an increase of $571.8 million. This increase is a result of higher metal prices and higher copper, molybdenum and silver sales volume. The increase in sales volumes was due to the recovery of the SXEW production at our Buenavista mine and to higher ore grades and recoveries at La Caridad mine. Net sales in 2010 included a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $14.3 million. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2010 were $910.3 million compared with $745.7 million in 2009, an increase of $164.6 million. The increase was the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2010 of $164.5 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $710.1 million in 2010, compared with $545.6 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to $104.2 million of higher metal purchased from third parties to cover the production loss from the Buenavista mine and the concentrate purchased from our IMMSA unit after the closing of the San Luis Potosi copper smelter in March 2010 and $29.6 million of higher workers’ participation due to the increase in earnings. The concentrates previously smelted at San Luis Potosi are now purchased and processed at La Caridad. Operating income in 2010 was $738.2 million compared with $331.0 million in 2009, an increase of $407.2 million or 123.0%. Operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA unit Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 512.7 $ 560.2 $ (47.5 ) (8.5 )% Operating costs and expenses (359.0 ) (423.3 ) 64.3 15.2 % Operating income $ 153.7 $ 136.9 $ 16.8 12.3 % Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2010 were $512.7 million, compared with $560.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $47.5 million. The decrease in 2010 was due to lower volume of copper, silver and zinc and sales by the Santa Eulalia mine primarily as a result of the decrease in production because of the unusually heavy rains, which caused flooding in the area and hindered production. We are working to rectify this problem and expect to restore production to normal levels by October 2011. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $359.0 million in 2010 compared with $423.3 million in 2009, a decrease of $64.3 million. This decrease was primarily the result of $71.3 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) included $129.1 million of lower metal purchases from third parties, net of $38.0 million of higher inventory consumption. Operating income in 2010 was $153.7 million compared with $136.9 million in 2009, an increase of $16.8 million. Operating income increased primarily as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 21 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. 97 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008. Net sales Net sales in 2009 were $3,734.3 million compared with $4,850.8 million in 2008, a decrease of $1,116.5 million. The decrease was principally a result of lower average metal prices, partially offset by increases in sales volume. Copper sales volume increased slightly in 2009. However, molybdenum, and silver sales volume increased 12.6% and 21.1%, respectively, as a result of higher grades and recovery at our Cuajone and La Caridad mines. In addition, zinc sales volume increased 3.5% due to higher grades and recoveries. The decline in metal prices, which began late in 2008 and continued into 2009 began to recover in the second quarter of 2009 and continued through the balance of the year. Copper prices averaged over $3.00 per pound in the fourth quarter and closed 2009 at $3.33 per pound. The average molybdenum and zinc prices in 2009 were 61.6% and 11.8% lower than 2008, respectively. Net sales in 2008 also include a $137.0 million gain on copper derivatives. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2009 and 2008. Copper Sales by product (million pounds) 2009 2008 Refined 692.4 657.4 Blister 40.0 21.9 Anode 30.8 22.0 Concentrates and other 94.2 101.4 SXEW 126.0 142.2 Rod 134.4 169.6 Total 1,117.8 1,114.5 Mine copper production was 1,070.1 million pounds in 2009, a decrease of 0.7% from 2008. This decrease of 7.8 million pounds included a reduction of 19.4 million pounds at our Mexican open-pit segment mainly due to the strike at our Buenavista mine, which was partially offset by an increase of 11.1 million pounds at our Peruvian mines due to higher ore grades and recoveries at the Toquepala mine. Molybdenum production was 41.2 million pounds in 2009, a 14.0% increase from 2008. This increase was principally due to higher ore grades at the La Caridad and Cuajone mines. Mine zinc production amounted to 243.5 million pounds in 2009, a 3.3% increase from 2008. The increase of 7.7 million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to higher ore grades at the Santa Barbara mine, and higher recoveries at the Santa Eulalia and Charcas mines. Copper made up 70.7% of net sales in 2009 compared with 69.2% in 2008. Sales of by-products in 2009 totaled $1,095.4 million compared with $1,495.9 million in 2008, a decrease of 26.8%. The decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the sales prices for molybdenum and zinc. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. 98 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2009 2008 Molybdenum 11.7 % 16.5 % Zinc 4.7 % 4.0 % Silver 7.4 % 4.3 % Other by-products 5.5 % 6.0 % Total 29.3 % 30.8 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2009 was $1,823.7 million compared with $2,182.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $358.5 million, or 16.4%. The decrease in cost of sales was principally due to 1) $269.8 million of lower production cost, including, $200.8 million of lower fuel and power cost due to lower market prices, $28.8 million of lower operating and repair material cost and $28.4 million of lower contractor services at our Mexican operations, both mainly due to lower repairs at La Caridad mine, 2) $77.5 million of lower workers’ participation as a result of lower earnings and 3) $4.8 million of lower mine royalties due to lower sales value. Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2009 was $78.3 million compared with $102.4 million in 2008, a decrease of $24.1 million. The decrease was mainly due to $8.5 million of lower legal and consulting services in 2009, from amounts spent in 2008 for improvements in information systems technology and tax and internal controls, $7.2 million of lower cost resulting from the devaluation of the Mexican peso, $1.5 million of lower taxes on financial transactions at our Peruvian operations and $1.5 million of lower technical assistance and software licenses payments. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2009 was $24.6 million and included $14.6 million in Peru (including Chile) and $10.0 million in Mexico, compared with $37.0 million in 2008, of which $20.4 million was in Peru (including Chile) and $16.6 million in Mexico. Exploration expense in Peru decreased $5.8 million mainly as a result of the Tia Maria project entering the development stage in the second half of 2008. In 2008, exploration spending in Tia Maria was $4.6 million. Please see “Capital Investment Program”, under this Item 7. Also, in 2009 exploration expenses decreased $1.1 million in Chile due to lower drilling and reduced field work. Exploration spending in Mexico was $6.6 million lower in 2009 and includes a decrease of $3.5 million at the IMMSA mines of Charcas and Santa Eulalia and a decrease of $3.1 million at the La Caridad mine. These decreases were the result of less drilling and field work in 2009. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2009 was $97.6 million compared with $99.1 million in 2008, a decrease of $1.5 million. Interest expense decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in our average debt outstanding, mainly due to the payment of $150 million of the series A of our Yankee bonds in April 2008 and the amortization and decrease in interest rate of the Mitsui loan. Capitalized interest was $2.2 million and $6.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 99 Table of Contents Interest income Interest income in 2009 was $6.6 million compared with $48.4 million in 2008, a decrease of $41.8 million. Our interest income decreased largely as a result of lower average cash balances principally due to lower metal prices and lower interest rate largerly as a result of the international economic crisis. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments Gain on derivative instruments in 2009 was $4.2 million compared with a loss of $74.6 million in 2008. The losses on derivative instruments in 2009 and 2008 are all related to the U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives. The Mexican peso had appreciated 3.5% in 2009 compared to a devaluation of 24.5% in 2008. For a further discussion please see Note 17 “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. Gains or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gains or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was income of $6.1 million in 2009 compared with an income of $17.2 million in 2008. The decrease of $11.1 million includes $27.1 million of lower income at our Mexican operations and $16.0 million of higher income at our Peruvian operations. The decrease in income at our Mexican operation was mainly due to $17.8 million of lower gain on the sale of inactive properties and $5.5 lower miscellaneous sales. The increase in income at our Peruvian operation was largely due to a gain in the mark to market valuation of short-term investments in 2009 of $3.4 million compared with a loss of $10.3 million in 2008. Income taxes Income taxes in 2009 were $469.8 million and include $471.0 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $1.2 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2008 were $679.3 million and include $724.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $45.0 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The decrease of $209.5 million or 30.8% was primarily due to $689.3 million of lower pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2009 was 33.5%, compared with 32.5% in 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate is largely due to dividends received by SCC from tax jurisdictions with lower tax rate (Mexico 28%). The dividend income is taxed in the U.S. at a rate of 35%. The rate increase caused by this differential of 28% versus 35% was partially offset by benefits recognized when we settled prior year audits. Please see Note 9 “Income taxes” for further discussion of the settlement. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2009 was $5.2 million compared with $7.9 million in 2008, a decrease of $2.7 million or 34%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. 100 Table of Contents Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2009 was $929.4 million compared with $1,406.6 million in 2008, a decrease of $477.2 million or 33.9%. Net income attributable to SCC decreased as a result of the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2009 vs.2008: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2009 2008 Value % Net sales $ 2,223.5 $ 2,803.2 $ (579.7 ) (20.7 ) Operating costs and expenses (1,206.2 ) (1,273.0 ) 66.8 5.2 Operating income $ 1,017.3 $ 1,530.2 $ (512.9 ) (33.5 ) Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2009 were $2,223.5 million compared with $2,803.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $579.7 million. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in metal prices partially offset by an increase in copper and silver sales volume. The LME copper price was 25.9% lower in 2009 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum price was 61.6% lower. Copper and silver sales volume increased by 46.2 million pounds and 0.6 million ounces, respectively. The increase in copper sales volume was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala mine due to higher grades and recoveries. The increase in silver sales volume was due to higher production at both mines due to higher ore grades. Net sales in 2008 also include a gain on copper derivatives of $91.8 million while in 2009 we held no copper derivatives positions. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2009 were $1,206.2 million compared with $1,273.0 million in 2008, a decrease of $66.8 million principally due to lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,026.7 million in 2009 compared with $1,100.4 million in 2008. The decrease of $73.7 million was primarily the result of $121.8 million of lower cost of fuel and power due to a decrease in market prices and $64.6 million of lower workers’ participation due to lower earnings. These decreases were partially offset by $99.0 million of higher copper concentrates purchased from third parties to cover smelter production requirements. Operating income in 2009 was $1,017.3 million compared with $1,530.2 million in 2008, a decrease of $512.9 million. The operating income increased as a result of the factors described above.

This decrease is a result of lower metal prices, and lower copper sales volume, mainly refined and rod, due to the loss of production at Buenavista as a result of the ongoing strike. In 2008 we produced and sold 34 million pounds of copper at Buenavista versus nothing in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in silver and molybdenum production and sales volume due to higher ore grades and recoveries at La Caridad mine. Net sales in 2008 included a gain on copper derivatives of $45.2 million while there was no copper derivative activity in 2009. Operating cost and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2009 was $745.7 million compared with $949.5 million in 2008, a decrease of $203.8 million. The decrease was the result of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2009 of $182.6 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $545.6 million in 2009, compared with $728.2 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily the effect of the strike at the Buenavista mine and included, 1) $100.1 million of lower production cost, 2) $22.3 million of lower workers’ participation, 3) $54.3 million of lower inventory consumption, and 4) $14.0 million of severance payments in 2008. Operating income in 2009 was $331.0 million, compared with $634.1 million in 2008, a decrease of $303.1 million or 47.8%. The operating income decreased as a result of the factors described above.

The increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher silver and zinc production and sales volume at the Santa Barbara mine as a result of higher ore grades and higher recoveries at the Santa Eulalia, Charcas and Santa Barbara mines, partially offset by lower metal prices. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $423.3 million in 2009, compared with $513.3 million in 2008, a decrease of $90.0 million. This decrease was primarily the result of $69.3 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) included: $54.9 million of lower production cost mainly due to lower market prices for fuel and power cost and $21.4 million of lower inventory consumption. Operating income in 2009 was $136.9 million, compared with $11.8 million in 2008, an increase of $125.1 million. The operating income decreased primarily as a result of the factors described above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2010. Liquidity The following table shows the cash flow for the three year period ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 1,920.7 $ 963.2 $ 1,728.3 Net cash used for investing activities $ (473.8 ) $ (359.3 ) $ (418.6 ) Net cash provided (used) for financing activities $ 36.6 $ (458.0 ) $ (2,048.0 ) Net cash provided from operating activities: 2010-2009 The increase of $957.5 million in the 2010 cash provided from operating activities from 2009 was due to an increase of $628.1 million in net income and a decrease in working capital needs of $348.8 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher metal prices. In 2010, net income was $1,562.7 million, approximately 81.4% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $323.2 million and $13.5 million of net currency translation effect, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $40.4 million of a deferred income tax benefit, which was deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2010 a decrease in working capital increased operating cash flow by $62.6 million. The 2010 and 2009 increase (decrease) in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2010 2009 Variance Accounts receivable $ (308.1 ) $ (299.6 ) $ (8.5 ) Inventories (48.8 ) (4.5 ) (44.3 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 540.9 (89.1 ) 630.0 Other operating assets and liabilities (121.4 ) 107.1 (228.5 ) Total $ 62.6 $ (286.1 ) $ 348.7 The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher metal prices at the end of 2010 compared with 2009. The LME and COMEX copper prices increased by over 46.0% in 2010 compared with 2009, and molybdenum, zinc and silver increased by 43.0%, 30.7% and 37.6%, respectively. The increase in inventories of $48.8 million includes an increase of $12.4 million in finished goods inventory, principally due to shipping delays at our Mexican operations and $40.7 million of higher work-in process inventory principally due to scheduled repairs at our smelter facilities. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to an increase in workers’ participation and income tax provision due to the higher earnings. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2010 were a use of cash of $121.4 million, which 103 Table of Contents was caused principally by an increase of $51.6 million in the long term income tax provision. In 2009 net income was $934.6 million, approximately 97.0% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $322.6 million and $41.2 million of deferred income tax, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and ($56.8) million of the realized 2008 loss on derivative instruments, which were deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2009 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $286.1 million. 2009-2008 The decrease of $765.2 million in the 2009 cash provided from operating activities from 2008 was due to the reduction of $479.9 million in net income and an increase in working capital needs of $355.8 million. The reduction in net income was primarily due to lower metal prices. In 2009 net income was $934.6 million, approximately 97.0% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items (deducted from), or added to arrive to operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $322.6 million and $41.2 million of deferred income tax, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and ($56.8) million of the realized 2008 loss on derivative instruments, which were deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2009 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $286.1 million. The 2009 and 2008 increase (decrease) in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2009 2008 Variance Accounts receivable $ (299.6 ) $ 330.1 $ (629.7 ) Inventories (4.5 ) (3.3 ) (1.2 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (89.1 ) (164.3 ) 75.2 Other operating assets and liabilities 107.1 (92.9 ) 200.0 Total $ (286.1 ) $ 69.6 $ (355.7 ) The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher metal prices at the end of 2009 compared with 2008. The LME and COMEX copper prices increased by over 70% in the fourth quarter 2009 compared with the fourth quarter 2008, and zinc and silver increased by 85.2% and 73.0%, respectively. The increase in inventories of $4.5 million includes an increase of $23.8 million in metal inventory mainly due to higher metal purchases from third parties at our Mexican operations to reduce the production loss caused by the ongoing strikes net of a decrease of $19.2 million in supplies inventory. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to a decrease in accounts payable trade as a result of the lower prices of supplies and the strikes at our Mexican operations. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2009 were a source of cash of $107.1 million, which was caused principally by a decrease of $44.1 million in the long term income tax provision. Net cash used for investing activities: 2010: Net cash used for investing activities in 2010 included $408.7 million for capital expenditures, $66.9 million for the purchase of bonds classified as trading securities, and $21.5 million for our share of the investment in the development of the Tantahuatay gold project, less $14.7 million of proceeds from the sale of short- 104 Table of Contents term investments and $8.7 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties of our Mexican operations. The capital expenditures included $260.3 million of investments at our Peruvian operations, $152.5 million for the Tia Maria project, $32.8 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, $18.8 million for the Cuajone concentrator expansion and $56.2 million for various other replacement expenditures. In addition, we spent $140.9 million for replacement assets at our Mexican operations, $109.8 million of which was at our Mexican open-pit operations, $29.8 million at our IMMSA unit and $8.8 million for other corporate projects, including at our administrative office in Mexico City. 2009: Net cash used for investing activities in 2009 included $414.8 million for capital expenditures, $43.8 million of proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments and $11.8 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties at our Mexican operations. The capital expenditures included $284.4 million of investments at our Peruvian operations, $162.0 million for the Tia Maria project, $52.6 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, and $69.8 million for various other replacement expenditures. In addition, we spent $130.4 million for replacement assets at our Mexican operations, $79.4 million of which was at our Mexican open-pit operations, $27.8 million at our IMMSA unit and $23.2 million at our administrative office in Mexico City. 2008: Net cash used for investing activities included $524.4 million of capital expenditures, $45.2 million received from the redemption of short-term investments and $60.6 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties at our Mexican operations. The $524.4 million of capital expenditures includes the following expenditures at our Peruvian operations, $118.0 million for the Tia Maria project, $37.7 million for the Toquepala expansion project, $18.2 million for the Cuajone expansion project, $21.7 million for the tailing disposal project, $17.3 million for electrical shovels and $89.5 million for equipment replacement and upgrades. Capital expenditures also include equipment replacement and upgrade of $145.0 million at our Mexican open-pit operations, $44.2 million at our IMMSA unit and $32.8 million for our administrative office in Mexico. Net cash used for financing activities: 2010: Net cash provided from financing activities was $36.6 million and includes $1,480.8 million from the issuance of fixed-rate unsecured notes, net of debt issuance cost of $8.8 million, less a dividend distribution of $1,428.0 million, a debt repayment of $10.0 million and distributions to our non-controlling interest investors of $6.5 million. 2009: Net cash used for financing activities amounted to $458.0 million and included a shareholder dividend distribution of $376.0 million, a distribution to our non-controlling interest investors of $1.1 million, $71.9 million for the repurchase of 4.9 million shares of our common stock and $10.0 million for debt payment. 2008: Net cash used for financing activities amounted to $2,048.0 million, and included a shareholder dividend distribution of $1,710.8 million, a distribution to our non-controlling interest investors of $10.2 million, $384.7 million for the repurchase of 28.5 million shares of our common stock and $160.0 million of debt repayment. In addition, we received $216.4 million from the sale of 350 million shares of our parent company’s common stock. See Note 16 “Stockholder Equity.” Other Liquidity Considerations In 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an up to $500 million share repurchase program. Since the inception of the program we have purchased 33.4 million shares of 105 Table of Contents our common stock at a cost of $457 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. Substantially all of the purchases were made in 2008 and 2009. While we do not anticipate significant additional purchases, the repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 - SCC common stock repurchase plan. On January 27, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a dividend of 58 cents per share to be paid on March 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2011. Our dividend policy continues to be reviewed at Board of Directors’ meetings, taking into consideration the current capital investment program and expected future cash flow generated from operations. We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2011 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. In December 2006, our Peruvian Branch signed a contract with the Peruvian government committing our Company to make annual contributions for five years to support the regional development of Peru. The contributions are being used for social benefit programs. During these four years we made non-deductible contributions as follows (in millions): Payment 2006 $ 16.1 2007 18.9 2008 12.7 2009 9.2 This contract expired in 2010 with the last payment to be deposited in April 2011. At December 31, 2010 we made a provision of $14.8 million. It is our understanding that the Peruvian government is studying alternatives to replace this contribution and is considering, among other things, an increase in mining royalties or a tax on “windfall” profits. We believe that a decision on these options will be deferred until after the new Peruvian government takes office in late July 2011. The Peruvian presidential election is scheduled to be held in April 2011. In 2004, the Peruvian Congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies. Under this law, we are subject to a 1% to 3% charge based on sales, calculated on the value of the concentrates produced. We made a provision of $65.5 million, $43.7 million and $53.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for this charge. Retained earnings of $1.8 billion generated by our Mexican subsidiary have been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, we will not receive distributions of such amounts for the foreseeable future. We will incur in additional taxes equal to the difference between U.S. and Mexican tax rates that would result in the event that we receive distributions from our Mexican subsidiary. FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2010 was $2,760.4 million compared with $1,280.3 million at December 31, 2009, net of the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $26.0 million and $16.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in total debt during 2010 was due to the issuance of $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes described below. 106 Table of Contents The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 41.4% at December 31, 2010 compared to 24.7% at December 31, 2009. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 12.7% at December 31, 2010 compared with 11.5% at December 31, 2009. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. On April 16, 2010, we issued $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $10.3 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of the Company’s capital expenditure program. Please see Note 12 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital Investment Programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments due by Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 2,786.4 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ — $ 200.0 $ 2,556.4 Interest on debt 4,389.4 189.3 189.0 188.8 188.7 183.3 3,450.3 Uncertain tax position(a) 77.8 Workers’ participation 222.4 222.4 Contribution to the Peruvian regional development 14.8 14.8 Pension and post-retirement obligations 73.2 12.4 5.3 5.4 5.7 5.9 38.5 Asset retirement obligation 59.1 59.1 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,161.3 167.5 167.6 192.5 192.5 192.5 248.7 Capital expenditure projects 246.1 186.8 58.3 1.0 — — — Total $ 9,030.5 $ 803.2 $ 430.2 $ 397.7 $ 386.9 $ 581.7 $ 6,353.0 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2010 the liability recognized by the Company is $77.8 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. 107 Table of Contents Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account of $26 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2010. As almost all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change significantly due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 12 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pursuant to our agreement with the Peruvian Government signed on December 28, 2006 we had committed to make annual contributions for five years for the regional development of Peru based on Peruvian Branch’s earnings after income tax. The contribution expired in 2010 and the last deposit should be made in April 2011. For an additional discussion on this matter please see “Regional development contribution” in Note 15 “Commitments and contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 13 “Benefit plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM. See Note 11 “Asset retirement obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. In 2009 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Enersur regarding the power supply agreement. As a result of the MOU, formulas for calculating the monthly power cost have changed, decreasing power cost vis a vis the former methodology. The new formula has been applied since May 2009 to date and will be used until the end of the contract in 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs as amended by the MOU, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Peruvian projects of Tia Maria and the Toquepala concentrator expansion. 108 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 83) to GAAP cost of sales in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)—GAAP $ 2,099.4 $ 2.019 $ 1,823.7 $ 1.743 $ 2,182.2 $ 1.976 Add: Selling, general and administrative 88.3 0.085 78.3 0.075 102.4 0.093 Treatment and refining charges 54.6 0.053 42.3 0.040 40.8 0.037 By-product revenue (1) (1,384.1 ) (1.331 ) (1,017.3 ) (0.972 ) (1,476.1 ) (1.336 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (10.4 ) (0.010 ) (29.6 ) (0.028 ) (18.2 ) (0.016 ) Less: Workers’ participation (244.3 ) (0.235 ) (134.7 ) (0.129 ) (212.1 ) (0.192 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (280.6 ) (0.270 ) (266.6 ) (0.255 ) (232.8 ) (0.211 ) Royalty charge and other, net (201.0 ) (0.194 ) (145.5 ) (0.139 ) (121.6 ) (0.111 ) Inventory change 53.2 0.051 23.8 0.023 (23.9 ) (0.022 ) Operating Cash Cost 175.1 0.168 $ 374.4 $ 0.358 $ 240.7 $ 0.218 Less by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties 1,394.5 1.341 1,046.9 1.001 1,494.3 1.353 Operating Cash Cost, without by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties $ 1,569.6 $ 1.509 $ 1,421.9 $ 1.359 $ 1,735.0 $ 1.571 Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,039.8 1,046.1 1,104.6 (1) Includes net by-product sales revenue and premiums on sales of refined products. 109 Table of Contents Net debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 Total debt $ 2,760.4 $ 1,280.3 Cash and cash equivalent balance (2,192.7 ) (772.3 ) Net debt 567.7 508.0 Net capitalization: Net debt 567.7 508.0 Equity 3,910.4 3,893.7 Net capitalization $ 4,478.1 $ 4,401.7 Net debt/net capitalization (*) 12.7 % 11.5 % (*) Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal price risk: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated changes in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2010 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 7.6 $ 21.1 $ 1.1 $ 7.7 Foreign currency exchange risk: We are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. To manage the volatility related to the risk, we may enter into forward exchange contracts, currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 2.1 % 0.2 % 6.6 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (2.8 )% (8.0 )% 4.8 % Mexico Mexican inflation rate 4.4 % 3.6 % 6.5 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (5.4 )% (3.5 )% 24.5 % Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate change of 10% at December 31, 2010, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our operating income as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 32.1 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (39.2 ) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 40.1 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (32.8 ) 111 Table of Contents The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2010. Interest rate risk: A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based upon our indebtedness at December 31, 2010, a change in interest rates of one percent (or 100 basis points) would have an average annual impact on net income and cash flows of $0.5 million. Most of our debt is at fixed rates. Derivative instruments: As part of our risk management policy, we occasionally use derivative instruments to (i) safeguard corporate assets, (ii) insure the value of its future revenue stream and (iii) lessen the impact of unforeseen market swings on its sales revenues. To meet with these objectives we, from time to time, enter into commodities prices derivatives, interest rate derivative, exchange rate derivative and other instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposure to market risk. Copper swaps: In 2010 and 2008, we entered into copper swaps and zero cost collar derivative contracts to reduce price volatility and to protect our sales value as shown below. In 2010, these transactions meet the requirements of hedge accounting but not in 2008. The realized gains and losses from these derivatives were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings and included in operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. We did not hold any copper derivatives in 2009. The following table summarized the copper derivative activity related to copper sales transactions realized in 2010 and 2008: 2010 2008 Zero cost collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) — 220.5 Average LME cap price — $ 4.23 Average LME floor price — $ 3.40 Swap contracts: Pounds (in millions) 276.7 175.1 Weighted average COMEX price $ 3.79 $ 3.87 Realized (loss) gain on copper derivatives $ (41.9 ) $ 137.0 In addition, we have a hedge program to protect the sales value of a portion of our copper production for years 2011 and 2012. The hedge instruments are based on LME copper prices. We performed statistical analysis on the difference between the average monthly copper price on the LME and the COMEX exchanges and determined that the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.999. Based on this analysis we consider that the LME underlying price matches our sales priced at COMEX prices. These cash 112 Table of Contents flow hedge relationships qualify as critical matched terms hedge relationships and as a result have no ineffectiveness. We perform periodic quantitative assessments to confirm that the relationship was highly effective and that the ineffectiveness was the de minimus. At the end of 2010 we held copper derivative contracts to protect a portion of our copper sales for 2011 and the first quarter 2012, as follows: 2011 1st Quarter 2012 Zero cost collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) 423.3 16.5 Average LME cap price $ 4.84 $ 4.81 Average LME floor price $ 3.02 $ 3.50 Estimated % of copper sales covered 30 % 5 % Unrealized loss recognized in other comprehensive income (net of income taxes of $25.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively) (in millions) $ 45.2 $ 1.1 Swap contracts: Pounds (in millions) 291.0 — Weighted average COMEX price $ 3.88 — Estimated % of copper sales covered 21 % Unrealized loss recognized in other comprehensive income net of income taxes of $45.1 million (in millions) $ 79.3 — Additionally, in January and early February 2011, we entered into copper swaps contracts to protect 165.9 million pounds of copper for 2011 at an average price of $4.42 per pound and into zero cost collar contracts to protect 29.8 million pounds of copper for the first quarter of 2012 at an average floor price of $3.50 per pound of copper and an average cap price of $5.38 per pound of copper. With the addition of these contracts we increased the percentage of our 2011 and first quarter 2012 copper sales coverage to 61% and 13%, respectively. Transactions under these metal price protection programs are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging-embedded derivatives” (formerly SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”) as they meet the requirements for this treatment and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income until settlement, at which time the gain or loss is reclassified to net sales in the consolidated statements of earnings. We expect to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months the unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $124.5 million (net of income tax) at the time the underlying hedged transactions are realized. However, changes in copper prices in the next 12 months could increase or decrease the amount of the loss to be reclassified into earnings. Please see additional disclosure about fair value on Note 18-”Financial instruments”. Gas swaps: In the last three years we entered into gas swap contracts to protect part of our gas consumption as follows: 113 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 Gas volume (MMBTUs) 306,000 460,000 Fixed price $ 3.6350 $ 8.2175 Loss (in millions) $ — $ (0.9 ) The losses obtained were included in the production cost. At December 31, 2010 we did not hold any gas contract positions. Exchange rate derivatives, U.S. dollar / Mexican peso contracts: Because more than 85% of our sales collections in Mexico are in US dollars and many of our costs are in Mexican pesos, we entered into zero-cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting, within a range, against an appreciation of the Mexican peso to the US dollar.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC”, the” Company”, “our”, and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business” - “Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile and in 2011 we have started exploration activities in Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. Net sales value and net income in 2011 were the highest of our Company’s history and we look forward to obtaining even better results in the future. Our strong reserve base and attractive projects will enable us to increase production, enhance asset value and provide strong returns to our shareholders. We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. Our copper ore reserves, at December 31, 2011, totaled 58.8 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $2.00 per pound (as of December 31, 2011, the LME and COMEX copper price was $3.43). Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · Changes in copper and molybdenum prices: The average LME and COMEX copper price was $4.00 per pound in 2011, about 17% higher than in 2010. Average silver and zinc prices in 2011 increased about 74% and 1%, while molybdenum decreased about 2%. We believe that in 2011 macroeconomic concerns significantly affected copper market conditions. However, the market fundamentals appear sound and, considering our cost structure, we anticipate a year with improved results. We expect a more stable situation in 2012 that will provide support to copper prices. In addition, we are expecting a balanced market for molybdenum. · Sales structure: In the last three years approximately 74% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 11% from molybdenum, 7% from silver and 8% from various other products, including zinc, gold and other materials. · Metal markets: During the fourth quarter of 2011, metal markets have continued to be affected by negative macroeconomic events, such as the European recession and debt crisis. Even though we believe copper demand is 72 Table of Contents negatively influenced by these events, fundamentals for this metal have improved in recent months due to the end of European destocking, the rebound in Chinese consumption and the structural underperformance of supply. Several sources, as well as our own commercial sources, estimate that the copper destocking process finished in both Europe and Asia. The recent growth in Chinese copper imports to about one million tons for the past quarter shows the recovery of visible consumption in this country. Demand from emerging economies is also growing at a good pace, offsetting lower consumption from the European and U.S. markets. According to the same sources, demand growth is estimated at 2.2% for 2012. If we consider global copper demand at about 19.6 million tons, this represents approximately 430,000 tons of additional copper demand in 2012. On the supply side, production has underperformed badly in 2011 and, particularly, in the last quarter due to labor unrest, power shortages, adverse weather conditions and ore grade declines. We consider that these events are likely to continue in 2012, maintaining tightness in the copper market. Currently, market analysts estimate a market deficit of 400,000 tons for the year. · Production: For 2012, we are currently expecting copper production of 640,000 tons including approximately 5% which would be from third party copper. We expect molybdenum production in 2012 to be about 17,200 tons. · Capital Expenditures: In 2012, we will continue with our capital investment program. We have budgeted $1.5 billion in spending for the year. Spending in Peru is estimated to be $0.5 billion and in Mexico $1.0 billion. This investment is part of our five year program to increase production of copper, molybdenum and other by-products and also to replace obsolete equipment. Peru Achieves International Recognition: The Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (“EITI”) decided, at its February 17, 2012 London meeting, to award Peru the status of “EITI Compliant” as per the requirements set forth by this international initiative. The EITI is the global standard that ensures accountability and transparency of the revenues from a country’s extractives sector (mining and hydrocarbons). SCC had an active and leading participation in accomplishing this crucial milestone for Peru as representative of mining companies within the EITI National Work Group Commission. Peru is the only country in the Americas to have achieved such recognition. AMC´s exchange offer proposal: In July 2010, we received a non-binding proposal from our parent company, AMC, offering to effect an all-stock business combination of Southern Copper and AMC, the parent company of Asarco. In October 2011, AMC announced, in light of discussions with a committee of our independent directors, that it had withdrawn the proposed transaction to combine AMC and Southern Copper. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2011: 2011 2010 2009 Net sales (in millions) $ 6,819 $ 5,150 $ 3,734 Net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 2,336 $ 1,554 $ 929 Earnings per share $ 2.76 $ 1.83 $ 1.09 Dividends per share $ 2.46 $ 1.68 $ 0.44 Average LME copper price $ 4.00 $ 3.42 $ 2.34 Pounds of copper sold (in millions) 1,320 1,106 1,118 Prices of copper and our principal by-products, except molybdenum, were all higher in 2011 but were trending lower at year end. The 2011 copper sales volume was 19.3% higher due to the restoration of the Buenavista mine production. However, sales volumes for most of our by-products were generally lower; molybdenum, silver and zinc were lower by 9.1%, 8.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Earnings increased by 50.3% in 2011 principally as a result of the full restoration of Buenavista production and higher average copper prices and the prices for many of our major by-products. 73 Table of Contents Production: The table below highlight, key mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2011: 2011 2010 2009 Copper (in million pounds) 1,295 1,055 1,070 Molybdenum (in million pounds) 41 45 41 Zinc (in million pounds) 185 219 243 Silver (in million ounces) 13 13 13 2011 compared with 2010: Mined copper in 2011 increased 240 million pounds or 22.8% over the 2010 production principally due to higher production at our Buenavista mine. The Buenavista mine restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and increased production by 335 million pounds. Decreases at our Peruvian mines of 85 million pounds, largely from lower ore grade at the Cuajone mine and a decrease of 10 million pounds at La Caridad mine, due to lower grades and recoveries, partially offset the increase from Buenavista. Molybdenum production decreased by approximately 4 million pounds in 2011, 9.5% lower than in 2010, due primarily to 5.5 million pounds of lower production at the Cuajone mine partially offset by 1.2 million of higher production at the Toquepala mine both due to changes in recoveries, and lower ore grades at Cuajone mine. Zinc mine production, which comes from our IMMSA unit in Mexico decreased by 34 million pounds in 2011, 15.5% lower than in 2010, principally due to no production at the Santa Eulalia mine and decreases in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines of 19 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades. In May 2010, the Santa Eulalia mine suspended operations due to a flooding in the area brought on by the failure of a dyke caused by excess water pressure. In 2011, rehabilitation work was interrupted by a second flooding which required to us to extend the pumping work. At December 31, 2011, the rehabilitation work continues and we expect to restore mine production by May 2012. Our silver production increased slightly in 2011, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine mostly offset by lower production at some of our other mines. 2010 compared with 2009: Mined copper in 2010 was 15 million pounds under the 2009 mined copper production. A net decrease at our Peruvian mines of 43 million pounds, largely from lower grade at the Cuajone mine and a decrease of 17 million pounds from La Caridad mine, due to lower grades and recoveries, were partially offset by 46 million pounds of SXEW production from the Buenavista mine, which began restoring operations in the second half of 2010. In 2009, Buenavista was completely shutdown. Molybdenum production reached a record level in 2010. Production increased by approximately 4 million pounds in 2010 due primarily to ore grade and recovery increases at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. Zinc production decreased by 24 million pounds in 2010 due principally to the lower production at the Santa Eulalia mine due to the flooding above mentioned. Silver production decreased 4.2% in 2010, due to decreases at our operations in Mexico and Peru. Buenavista mine: The Buenavista facility is working at full capacity and focused on its expansion program, which include a new SXEW plant with a planned annual capacity of 120,000 tons of copper, a concentrator expansion with an increase in production capacity of 188,000 tons per year and two molybdenum plants with a combined annual capacity of 4,600 tons. This investment program is underway and we expect to complete it in two phases, the first in 2013 with the new SXEW plant and the second phase in 2015 with the concentrator expansion. With these investments, total production capacity at Buenavista will reach 488,000 tons. The rehabilitation of the Buenavista facility was completed in 2011 at a total cost of $212.8 million, of this $131.7 million were capitalized and $81.1 million were charged to operating cost. Tantahuatay mine: The Tantahuatay mine is located in Cajamarca, in northern Peru. Production started in August 2011 and we have produced 46,200 ounces of gold and 260,100 ounces of silver in 2011.Tantahuatay is expected to have an 74 Table of Contents average annual production of 90,000 ounces of gold and 425,000 ounces of silver for five years. We have a 44.2% participation in this project. Tia Maria project: We have begun the preparation of a new EIA study that will address recent government guidance, as well as the concerns expressed by the neighboring communities. We are confident that this initiative will allow us to obtain approval for the development of the 120,000 ton annual production copper project. Considering current delays in the project approval process, we are rescheduling the project start-up date to 2015. Some of the equipment already purchased for Tia Maria is being assigned to our operations at Buenavista, Toquepala, and Cuajone. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These include, (i) our “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (ii) metal prices, (iii) business segments, (iv) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (v) our capital expansion and exploration programs. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” on page 97. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), less the cost of purchased concentrates, plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges, net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties and by-product revenues, and sales premiums; less workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge, the special mining tax and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products: molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold and other minor by- products and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in the prices of silver and zinc, have had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. We exclude the cost of purchases of third party copper material. From time to time we purchase copper concentrates on the open market in order to maximize the use of our metallurgical facilities or to take advantage of an attractive market situation. We view these purchases on an incremental basis and measure the results incrementally. We find that the inclusion of these purchases with our own production often creates a distortion in our unit cost. Accordingly, we include only the net effect of these purchases as a by-product credit, so that only the net revenue or loss from the transaction is included in the calculation. We believe this will allow others to see a truer presentation of our cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge and special mining tax. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2011. 75 Table of Contents Year Positive (negative) Variance (Cents per pound) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-products revenue 165.7 152.0 141.1 (13.7 ) (10.9 ) Add: by-product revenues (124.2 ) (134.0 ) (100.0 ) (9.8 ) 34.0 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced 41.5 18.0 41.1 (23.5 ) 23.1 2011 compared with 2010: As seen on the chart above, our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was higher by 13.7 cents per pound in 2011, compared with 2010 principally due to higher production cost, mainly power and fuel cost due to increased market prices, labor due to salary increases and repair costs, partially offset by the higher production from the Buenavista mine. Our cash cost per pound for 2011 when calculated with by-product revenues is 41.5 cents per pound, compared with 18.0 cents per pound in 2010. The increase was due to some cost inflation, mainly fuel and power and lower by-product credit largely due to lower molybdenum sales volume and price. 2010 compared with 2009: As seen on the chart above, our per pound cash cost, excluding by-product revenues, was higher by 10.9 cents per pound in 2010, compared with 2009 principally due to an increase in production cost, mainly power and fuel cost due to increased market prices, labor cost due to salary increases, local currency appreciation and repair costs. Our cash cost per pound for 2010 when calculated with by-product revenues was 18.0 cents per pound, compared with 41.1 cents per pound in 2009. The increase in the by-product credit in the 2010 period was largely due to higher sales prices for molybdenum, silver and zinc and a record molybdenum production in 2010. The increase in the credit for molybdenum was 26.6 cents per pound in 2010, of which 19.0 cents was due to higher prices. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is influenced by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to financial investments. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated 2012 net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 7.7 $ 22.4 $ 1.1 $ 8.2 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and the Buenavista mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. 76 Table of Contents Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/exchange rate effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 4.8 % 2.1 % 0.2 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (4.0 )% (2.8 )% (8.0 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.8 % 4.4 % 3.6 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 13.1 % (5.4 )% (3.5 )% Capital Investment Program We made capital expenditures of $612.9 million, $408.7 million and $414.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In general, the capital expenditures and investment projects described below are intended to increase production and/or decrease costs. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Peruvian projects: Tia Maria — Arequipa $ 1.6 $ 152.5 $ 162.0 Toquepala concentrator expansion 76.0 32.8 52.6 Cuajone concentrator expansion 38.9 18.8 4.3 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 0.7 3.3 5.6 Ilo smelter modernization (including marine trestle) — 1.6 10.2 Ilo power transmission substation 9.8 — — Sub-total projects 127.0 209.0 234.7 Maintenance and replacement 78.7 55.2 49.7 Total Peruvian expenditures 205.7 264.2 284.4 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine rehabilitation and benefit plant 96.7 35.0 — Buenavista mine expansion 97.4 — — New Buenavista concentrator 7.7 — — El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 9.4 14.1 10.4 La Caridad tailings dam — Internal dikes — 4.3 2.2 Santa Eulalia pumping system 9.6 3.2 0.6 La Caridad concentrator plant expansión 1.5 0.3 0.2 Pilares mine (including land acquisition) — 0.2 0.7 Buenavista SXEW plant III 6.5 — — Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material, phase III 13.6 — — San Luis Potosi effluent plant — — 4.9 Sub-total projects 242.4 57.1 19.0 Maintenance and replacement 164..8 87.4 111.4 Total Mexican expenditures 407.2 144.5 130.4 Total capital expenditures $ 612.9 $ 408.7 $ 414.8 77 Table of Contents We are committed to continuing the growth of our Company. In 2012, we will continue with our capital investment program. We have budgeted $1.5 billion in spending for the year. Spending in Peru is estimated to be $0.5 billion and in Mexico $1.0 billion including approximately $0.7 billion for our Buenavista investment program. This investment is part of our five year capital investment program to increase production of copper and molybdenum. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in the economy or market conditions. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. Peruvian operations: Toquepala concentrator expansion: Through December 31, 2011, we have spent $199 million on the Toquepala expansion, mainly on mine equipment which is being used for the initial stripping of the project. The scope of the project has been defined as an increase in milling capacity to 120,000 tons per day which should increase annual production by 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum. The EIA for the project was presented to MINEM in July 2011. As part of the approval process for the EIA a public hearing was held at Toquepala in September 2011, but as a result of off-site protests the Peruvian government declared the hearing invalid. We are awaiting direction from the Peruvian government to move forward with the process of approval of the EIA. Assuming we receive approval of the EIA on a timely basis, project completion is scheduled for the first quarter of 2014. Cuajone concentrator expansion: Through December 31, 2011, we have spent $80.2 million on the Cuajone expansion project. As a first stage of the expansion plans, the project includes a variable cut-off grade methodology which will allow us to increase copper and molybdenum production. When finished, the project will increase copper production by 22,000 tons per year. Project completion of this stage is scheduled for the third quarter of 2012. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage of the tailings disposal project was completed. Construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam, started in June 2010, was finished. The project has a total budgeted cost of $66.0 million with $47.7 million expended through December 31, 2011. Tantahuatay: The Tantahuatay mine is located in Cajamarca, in northern Peru. Production started in August 2011 and the mine produced 46,200 ounces of gold and 260,100 ounces of silver in 2011. Tantahuatay is expected to have an average annual production of 90,000 ounces of gold and 425,000 ounces of silver for five years. We have a 44.2% participation in this project. Tia Maria project: We have initiated a bidding process to prepare a new EIA study for the project. We are confident that this initiative will convey a positive effect to our stakeholders and will allow us to obtain approval for the development of the 120,000 ton annual production copper project. As a consequence, we are rescheduling the project start up to the beginning of 2015. Additionally, some of the equipment already purchased is being assigned to our operations at Buenavista, Toquepala, and Cuajone. Mexican operations: SXEW III plant at the Buenavista mine: After obtaining the necessary environmental permits, the construction of the plant has started. Some of the equipment originally purchased for the Tia Maria project will be used for this SXEW plant. This will allow us to increase the annual SXEW plant capacity from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The new plant should begin operating in the second half of 2013. The project has a total budget cost of $444 million, with $8.6 million spent through December 31, 2011. Crushing, conveying and spreading system at Buenavista: Associated with the SXEW III project, we are also building a Quebalix facility at Buenavista. This investment consists in a crushing, conveying and spreading system that improves the SXEW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing the required time to extract copper from mineral. Overall 78 Table of Contents progress is 88% and this facility is expected to begin operating in the second quarter of 2012. The project has a total budgeted cost of $70 million, with $48.7 million expended through December 31, 2011. Molybdenum plant at Buenavista: Buenavista’s new 2,000 ton per year molybdenum circuit is in the equipment purchasing stage, under an engineering, procurement, construction and management contract. Environmental permits will be obtained shortly and we expect to begin construction in the first quarter of 2012, with production beginning in the second quarter of 2013. The project has a total budget cost of $38.2 million with $1.2 million expended through December 31, 2011. New Buenavista concentrator: The new Buenavista concentrator, with a milling capacity of 100,000 tons per day, is in process. Basic and detailed engineering are moving forward as scheduled. Environmental permits have been obtained. We are evaluating several supplier proposals for the main equipment. Purchase orders for crushers, primary and secondary ball mills and motors have been placed. The new concentrator will have an estimated annual production of 188,000 tons of copper and 2,600 tons of molybdenum. It is expected to begin operation by 2015. Total budget cost of this project is $1.4 billion. Required infrastructure for these projects, including power, water, roads, shops, laboratories, townsites, etc., is included in the master plan. A preliminary study has been delivered and we are working to have these projects aligned. Pilares project: On October 27, 2011, the Board of Directors approved the development of the second stage of the Pilares mine, with a budget of $136.3 million. In 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Pilares, with the intention of operating it as an open pit facility. Current mineralized resources are estimated at 43.4 million tons with 0.789% of copper sulfide content and 0.077% copper oxide. We expect to increase copper production by 40,000 tons per year by sending mineral from the Pilares site to our La Caridad concentrator. Pilares should begin operations by the third quarter of 2013. Angangueo: Also, in October 2011, the Board of Directors approved an expenditure of $131 million for the development of the Angangueo mine. This site in Michoacan, Mexico, is a polymetallic deposit with an annual production potential of 36,000 tons of copper, 4.5 million ounces of silver and 41,000 tons of zinc. In 2012, we expect to start the underground development and the construction of a 2,000 tons per day concentrator will begin. The project is scheduled to begin production in the second half of 2014. Potential projects: El Arco: El Arco is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with estimated mineralized material of over 1.0 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.51% and 14 grams of gold per ton. This project is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. We continue to invest in land acquisition required for the project. In 2010, the project feasibility study was completed at a cost of $15.0 million. We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, environmental concerns, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. Exploration: In 2011, we begin exploration activities in Ecuador and Argentina. Besides these new efforts, we continue with our exploration activities in Mexico, Peru and Chile. Ecuador In 2011, we started exploration activities in Ecuador. For 2012, we expect to begin exploration work on the project Chaucha, located south of Guayaquil. The mineralization is characteristic of a copper-molybdenum porphyry system. In 2012, we plan to execute a program of 10,000 meters of diamond drilling to evaluate the deposit. 79 Table of Contents Argentina In the last quarter of 2011, we started exploration activities in Argentina. We plan to carry out exploration in the south of Argentina, where mineralization for porphyry copper, epithermal gold and silver and polymetallic skarn is expected. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3”Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.00 per pound for copper and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $3.26 per pound for copper and $13.95 per pound for molybdenum, both current average prices as of December 31, 2011. The prices for copper and molybdenum were $2.97 and $18.59, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and $2.90 and $23.44, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices, which is a reasonable possibility, would not affect our statement of earnings. Long-term inventory - Leachable Material: In prior years we capitalized the production cost of leachable material with low copper content at the Buenavista mine in Mexico. In 2011, we extended this practice of recognizing inventories for costs associated with leaching activities at the La Caridad mine in Mexico and at the Toquepala mine in Peru in order to conform to evolving mine production plans at these mines. As a result of changing market conditions and mining processes, mineral extraction through leaching has become integral to the mining operations carried out at La Caridad, Toquepala and Cuajone. Accordingly, the process and sale of mineral content in leaching dumps is reasonably assured and the costs associated with leaching activities at such mines are now recognized as inventories. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we 80 Table of Contents include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (included in work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. The cost attributed to the leach material is charged to cost of sales generally over a five-year period (the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine). However, change in the five year-cycle generally would not have a material impact on our financial results as our production is largely from non-leach material. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix fuel prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates and currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar conversion rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings as follows: copper and zinc derivatives are included in net sales, gain and losses related to fuel costs are included in cost of sales and all other are included in “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments.” Changes in the fair value of copper derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in sales as the hedged copper sales occur. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. 81 Table of Contents Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Tax” to record these liabilities. (See Note 8 “Income taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $3.00 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $14.74 per pound, along with near-term price forecast, for 2011, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $1.50 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $10.00 per pound showed projected undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 3.04 to 9.39 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. PROVISIONALLY PRICED SALES The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Provisionally Priced Sales 2011 2010 2009 Copper Millions of pounds 64.3 13.8 23.4 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 3.44 $ 4.38 $ 3.33 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 10.3 9.1 10.9 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 13.35 $ 16.40 $ 11.75 Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Provisional Sales Adjustments 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Copper $ 1.4 $ 4.8 $ 4.1 Molybdenum (3.4 ) 7.3 (16.2 ) Total $ (2.0 ) $ 12.1 $ (12.1 ) Management believes that the final pricing of these sales will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 82 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011.

SEGMENT SALES INFORMATION The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011: Copper Sales (million pounds) 2011 2010 2009 Peruvian operations 694.6 792.4 808.4 Mexican open-pit 626.0 311.7 289.0 Mexican IMMSA unit 15.4 23.0 34.6 Other and intersegment elimination (15.5 ) (21.0 ) (14.2 ) Total copper sales 1,320.5 1,106.1 1,117.8 83 Table of Contents By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver - million ounces) 2011 2010 2009 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 18.0 22.3 19.6 Silver 3.5 4.5 4.3 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 23.1 22.9 21.4 Silver 7.1 7.1 6.5 IMMSA unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 199.9 206.7 228.0 Silver 5.2 7.0 12.3 Other and intersegment elimination Zinc — 0.5 0.9 Silver (1.6 ) (3.2 ) (4.9 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 41.1 45.2 41.0 Zinc-refined and in concentrate 199.9 207.2 228.9 Silver 14.2 15.4 18.2 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010. Net sales Net sales in 2011 were a record $6,818.7 million, compared with $5,149.5 million in 2010, an increase of $1,669.2 million. The increase was principally the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista production which restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and higher copper, silver and zinc prices. The increase in metal prices was the result of improvements in the global economy and the demand and supply balance. Net sales in 2011 include a gain of $13.5 million on copper hedges, compared with a loss of $41.9 million in 2010. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2011 and 2010. Copper Sales by-product (million pounds) 2011 2010 Refined 795.8 637.2 Blister — — Anode 23.0 38.6 Concentrates and other 41.7 135.2 SXEW 218.0 167.4 Rod 242.0 127.7 Total 1,320.5 1,106.1 Copper made up 76.7% of net sales in 2011, compared with 72.7% in 2010. Sales of by-products in 2011 totaled $1,589.2 million, compared with $1,403.7 million in 2010, an increase of 13.2%. The increase of $185.5 million is principally attributable to higher silver price which increased 74.3% from $20.18 per ounce to $35.18 per ounce in 2011. 84 Table of Contents The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2011 2010 Molybdenum 8.0 % 13.3 % Silver 7.2 % 6.0 % Zinc 3.1 % 4.1 % Other by-products 5.0 % 3.9 % Total 23.3 % 27.3 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2011 was $2,763.2 million, compared with $2,129.0 million in 2010, an increase of $634.2 million, or 29.8%. The increase in cost of sales was principally attributable to the restoration of our Buenavista property to full production, the higher amount and cost of third-party concentrates used in 2011 and the increase in cost of fuel, power and operating and repair material. These increases were partially offset by an increase in leach material inventory of $160.3 million in 2011. Buenavista’s production cost increased by $268.7 million in 2011, in part caused by the repair expense to reestablish the operation, an increase of $9.3 million over 2010 and the balance due to the operational cost. The cost of third-party concentrates increased by $279.8 million over 2010, as 51,319 tons were purchased in 2011, an increase of 26,730 tons from 2010 principally at our Peruvian operations. Additionally, the 2011 cost of the purchased concentrates was higher due to the higher copper price in 2011. Fuel and power cost, excluding Buenavista’s consumption, increased by $93.3 million in 2011. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2011 was $186.6 million, compared with $160.5 million in 2010, an increase of $26.1 million. Interest expense increased in 2011 as a result of a full year interest expense on the $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes issued in April 2010 and an increase in the rate of the Mitsui loan. Capitalized interest was $5.9 million and $7.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income Interest income in 2011 was $13.8 million, compared with $7.8 million in 2010, an increase of $6.0 million. Our interest income increased as a result of higher average interest rates on investments. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $4.0 million in 2011, compared with an expense of $20.7 million in 2010. The $16.7 million decrease in other expenses in 2011 includes: 1) $14.8 million for a contribution to the regional development at our Peruvian operations in 2010, there was no contribution in 2011 as the obligation expired in 2010, 2) $6.9 million of higher income from scrap sales in 2011, 3) $4.7 million gain on net sales value of non-operating assets, in 2011, partially offset by 4) $8.3 million of loss on short term investments. Income taxes Income taxes in 2011 were $1,104.3 million and include $1,152.4 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $48.1 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2010 were $868.1 million and include $838.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $29.8 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The effective tax rate for 2011 was 32.0%, compared with 35.7% in 2010. The decrease in the rate is primarily due to the recognition of additional foreign tax credits reported and the increase in the allowable amount of percentage depletion claimed in the current and prior years. The benefit provided by 85 Table of Contents additional foreign tax credit and percentage depletion were partially offset by the 2011 accrual of U.S. tax on unremitted earnings of the Mexican subsidiaries. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2011 was $7.9 million, compared with $8.7 million in 2010, a decrease of $0.8 million or 8.4%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2011 was $2,336.4 million, compared with $1,554.0 million in 2010, an increase of $782.4 million. Net income attributable to SCC increased largely as a result of the restoration of production at the Buenavista mine and higher metal prices and other factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2011 vs.2010: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2011 2010 Value % Net sales $ 3,186.5 $ 3,125.9 $ 60.6 1.9 % Operating costs and expenses (1,644.4 ) (1,406.2 ) (238.2 ) (16.9 )% Operating income $ 1,542.1 $ 1,719.7 $ (177.6 ) (10.3 )% Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2011 were $3,186.5 million, compared with $3,125.9 million in 2010, an increase of $60.6 million. This increase was primarily due to the increase in metal prices. The LME copper price was 17.0% higher in 2011 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the silver price was 74.3% higher. The price increases were offset by the lower sales volume of copper, molybdenum and silver, which reduced our sales by approximately $422.3 million. 694.6 million pounds of copper were sold in 2011, compared with 792.4 million pounds of copper in 2010 as a result of lower production largely due to lower ore grade at the Cuajone mine. Net sales in 2011 also include a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.9 million while in 2010, net sales include a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $27.7 million. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2011 were $1,644.4 million, compared with $1,406.2 million in 2010, an increase of $238.2 million principally due to higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,441.0 million in 2011, compared with $1,206.2 million in 2010. The increase of $234.8 million was primarily the result of 1) $139.5 million of higher production cost principally due to $66.7 million of higher cost of fuel and power due to increases in market prices, $16.7 million of higher labor cost, and $56.1 million of higher operating and repair cost mainly due to repairs at our Ilo smelter plant, 2) $186.1 million for the higher cost of concentrates purchased from third parties, partially offset by 3) $42.6 million of lower workers’ participation due to a lower taxable income and 4) $42.9 million of leachable material inventory. Operating income in 2011 was $1,542.1 million, compared with $1,719.7 million in 2010, a decrease of $177.6 million. Operating income decreased as a result of the factors noted above. Mexican Open-pit Operations Change 2011 2010 Value % Net sales $ 3,212.1 $ 1,648.5 $ 1,563.6 94.8 % Operating costs and expenses (1,287.0 ) (910.5 ) (376.5 ) (41.4 )% Operating income $ 1,925.1 $ 738.0 $ 1,187.1 160.9 % 86 Table of Contents Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2011 were $3,212.1million, compared with $1,648.5 million in 2010, an increase of $1,563.6 million. This increase is largely the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista production, which restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and represented approximately $1,079.3 million of higher sales, and higher copper and silver prices Net sales in 2011 also include a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.6 million while in 2010, net sales included a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $14.3 million. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2011 were $1,287.0 million, compared with $910.5 million in 2010, an increase of $376.5 million. The increase was the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2011 of $364.1 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,115.8 million in 2011, compared with $751.7 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to 1) $337.9 million of higher production cost also due to the full restoration of the Buenavista production, 2) $74.2 million for the higher cost of metal purchased and 3) $55.7 million for higher workers’ participation due to the increase in earnings. These increases were partially offset by $117.4 million of capitalization of leachable material. Operating income in 2011 was $1,925.1 million, compared with $738.0 million in 2010, an increase of $1,187.1 million or 160.9%. Operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA unit Change 2011 2010 Value % Net sales $ 546.2 $ 512.7 $ 33.5 6.5 % Operating costs and expenses (370.5 ) (359.0 ) (11.5 ) (3.2 )% Operating income $ 175.7 $ 153.7 $ 22.0 14.3 % Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2011 were $546.2 million, compared with $512.7 million in 2010, an increase of $33.5 million. The increase of $33.5 million was due to higher metal prices of zinc and silver Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $370.5 million in 2011, compared with $359.0 million in 2010, an increase of $11.5 million. This increase was primarily the result of $1.9 million of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), $6.5 million of higher exploration expenses, $1.8 million of higher depreciation, amortization and depletion and $1.3 million of higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income in 2011 was $175.7 million, compared with $153.7 million in 2010, an increase of $22 million. Operating income increased primarily as a result of the factors described above. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009. Net sales Net sales in 2010 were $5,149.5 million, compared with $3,734.3 million in 2009, an increase of $1,415.2 million. The increase was principally a result of higher average metal prices and higher molybdenum sales volume. Molybdenum sales volume increased 10.5%, following a production record in 2010 due primarily to grade and recovery increases at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. The increase in metal prices was a result of improvements in the global economy and, in the case of copper, was helped by increased demand from China. 87 Table of Contents Net sales in 2010 include a loss of $41.9 million on copper hedges. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2010 and 2009. Copper Sales by-product (million pounds) 2010 2009 Refined 637.2 692.4 Blister — 40.0 Anode 38.6 30.8 Concentrates and other 135.2 94.2 SXEW 167.4 126.0 Rod 127.7 134.4 Total 1,106.1 1,117.8 Mine copper production was 1,055.0 million pounds in 2010, a decrease of 1.4% from 2009. This decrease of 15.1 million pounds included a reduction of 43.2 million pounds at our Peruvian operation, principally from the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades net of an increase of 28.0 million pounds at our Mexican open-pit mines. The increase was mainly due to 45.6 million pounds of SXEW cathodes from our Buenavista mine, which restored full leach capacity during the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a decrease of 16.8 million pounds at La Caridad mine due to lower ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production reached a record of 45.2 million pounds in 2010, a 9.8% increase from 2009. This increase was principally due to higher ore grades at the La Caridad and Toquepala mines. Mine zinc production amounted to 218.7 million pounds in 2010, a 10.2% decrease from 2009. The decrease of 24.8 million pounds in zinc production was principally the result of lower production at the Santa Eulalia mine which suspended operations in May 2010 due to a flooding in the area. Copper made up 72.7% of net sales in 2010, compared with 70.7% in 2009. Sales of by-products in 2010 totaled $1,403.7 million, compared with $1,095.4 million in 2009, an increase of 28.1%. The increase was principally attributable to the increase in the sales prices for molybdenum, silver and zinc, as well as higher molybdenum sales volume. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Years Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2010 2009 Molybdenum 13.3 % 11.7 % Silver 6.0 % 7.4 % Zinc 4.1 % 4.7 % Other by-products 3.9 % 5.5 % Total 27.3 % 29.3 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2010 was $2,129.0 million, compared with $1,865.8 million in 2009, an increase of $263.2 million, or 14.1%. The increase in cost of sales was principally due to 1) higher production cost, including $48.5 million of higher fuel and power cost due to higher market prices, $22.9 million of higher labor cost, including a payment of approximately $10.2 million in signing bonuses to our Peruvian workers, and $21.3 million of higher costs for repairs at our Ilo smelter, 2) $102.6 million of higher workers’ participation as a result of increased earnings, 3) $16.4 million of higher mine royalties due to higher sales value and 4) $35.9 million for the restoration costs at our Buenavista facility. 88 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative Our selling, general and administrative expense in 2010 was $100.3 million, compared with $85.2 million in 2009, an increase of $15.1 million. The increase was mainly due to $3.5 million of higher labor cost, $2.4 million of a currency translation effect due to the revaluation of the Mexican peso and $5.1 million of higher administrative workers participation. The 2009 administrative expenses include a credit adjustment of $3.5 million to the post retirement benefit plans at our Peruvian operations. Exploration We maintain active exploration programs in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Exploration expense in 2010 was $34.3 million and included $13.6 million in Peru (including Chile) and $20.7 million in Mexico, compared with $24.6 million in 2009, of which $14.6 million was in Peru and Chile and $10.0 million in Mexico. Exploration expense in Peru decreased $1.0 million mainly at Los Chancas due to the completion of the pre-feasibility studies, partially offset by the exploration at other several minor prospects. Exploration spending in Mexico was $10.7 million higher in 2010 principally due to 1) $7.4 million of higher drilling cost at our IMMSA mines which includes $2.8 million at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines and $4.6 million at the Santa Barbara mine, 2) $2.0 million at the La Caridad mine due to the restart of drilling programs, and 3) $1.1 million due to the acquisition of mining rights and additional field work. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2010 was $160.5 million, compared with $97.6 million in 2009, an increase of $62.9 million. Interest expense increased in 2010 as a result of the issuance of $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes at an average rate of 5.4%. Capitalized interest was $7.5 million and $2.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest income Interest income in 2010 was $7.8 million, compared with $6.6 million in 2009, an increase of $1.2 million. Our interest income increased as a result of higher average cash balances, principally because of improved earnings and additional borrowings. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments Gain on derivative instruments in 2009 was $4.2 million related to the U.S. dollar / Mexican peso exchange rate derivatives. The Mexican peso appreciated 3.5% in 2009. We did not hold any exchange rate derivatives in 2010. For a further discussion please see Note 16 “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements. Gains or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in net sales and gains or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $20.7 million in 2010, compared with income of $6.1 million in 2009. The significant items in 2010 that increased the expense in “Other income (expense)” include: 1) an expense in Peru of $14.8 million for the regional development contribution, an increase of $5.6 million over the prior year, attributable to higher profits, 2) a decrease in Peru of $1.4 million related to gains on sale of miscellaneous property, 3) the 2009 period recorded a gain of $1.7 million related to a contract breakage fee received by our Peruvian operations, 2010 did not include any fees of this nature. 4) our Mexican operations included an increase in other miscellaneous charges of $3.8 million which include payments to local municipalities of $1.7 million related to the settlement of the Buenavista (Cananea) strike. In addition donations are included in this category. 89 Table of Contents Income taxes Income taxes in 2010 were $868.1 million and include $838.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $29.8 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2009 were $469.8 million and include $471.0 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $1.2 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The increase of $398.3 million or 84.8% was primarily due to $1,026.4 million of higher pretax income. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 35.7%, compared with 33.5% in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate is principally due to an increase in unrecognized tax benefit (UTB) caused by a prior year change in the percentage depletion in the UTB and a decrease to the percentage depletion allowance presently forecasted for 2010 when compared with 2009. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2010 was $8.7 million, compared with $5.2 million in 2009, an increase of $3.5 million or 67.3%. This increase is the result of higher earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2010 was $1,554.0 million, compared with $929.4 million in 2009, an increase of $624.6 million. Net income attributable to SCC increased largely as a result of higher metal prices and the factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2010 vs.2009: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 3,125.9 $ 2,223.5 $ 902.4 40.6 % Operating costs and expenses (1,406.1 ) (1,206.2 ) (199.9 ) (16.6 )% Operating income $ 1,719.8 $ 1,017.3 $ 702.5 69.1 % Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2010 were $3,125.9 million, compared with $2,223.5 million in 2009, an increase of $902.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the increase in metal prices and an increase in molybdenum and silver sales volume. The LME copper price was 46.2% higher in 2010 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum and silver prices were 43% and 37.6% higher, respectively. Molybdenum and silver sales volume increased by 2.7 million pounds and 0.2 million ounces, respectively. The increase in molybdenum sales volume was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala mine due to higher grades and recoveries. The increase in silver sales volume was due to higher production at the Toquepala mine. Net sales in 2010 also include a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $27.7 million while in 2009 we held no copper derivatives positions. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2010 were $1,406.1 million, compared with $1,206.2 million in 2009, an increase of $199.9 million principally due to higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,206.2 million in 2010, compared with $1,019.7 million in 2009. The increase of $186.5 million was primarily the result of 1) $80.6 million of higher production cost principally due to $18.3 million of higher cost of fuel and power due to an increase in market prices, $20.7 million of higher labor cost, including a payment of approximately $10.2 million in signing bonuses to our Peruvian workers, and $41.6 million of operating and repair cost mainly due to repairs at our Ilo smelter plant, 2) $21.9 million of higher royalty charge and 3) $67.7 million of higher workers’ participation. The increases in royalty charge and the workers’ participation are both due to higher earnings. 90 Table of Contents Operating income in 2010 was $1,719.8 million, compared with $1,017.3 million in 2009, an increase of $702.5 million. Operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 1,648.5 $ 1,076.7 $ 571.8 53.1 % Operating costs and expenses (910.5 ) (745.7 ) (164.8 ) (22.1 )% Operating income $ 738.0 $ 331.0 $ 407.0 123.0 % Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2010 were $1,648.5 million, compared with $1,076.7 million in 2009, an increase of $571.8 million. This increase is a result of higher metal prices and higher copper, molybdenum and silver sales volume. The increase in sales volumes was due to the recovery of the SXEW production at our Buenavista mine and to higher ore grades and recoveries at La Caridad mine. Net sales in 2010 included a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $14.3 million. There was no copper derivative activity in 2009. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2010 were $910.5 million, compared with $745.7 million in 2009, an increase of $164.8 million. The increase was the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2010 of $157.0 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $751.7 million in 2010, compared with $594.7 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to $104.2 million of higher metal purchased from third parties to cover the production loss from the Buenavista mine and the concentrate purchased from our IMMSA unit after the closing of the San Luis Potosi copper smelter in March 2010 and $29.6 million of higher workers’ participation due to the increase in earnings. The concentrates previously smelted at San Luis Potosi are now purchased and processed at La Caridad. Operating income in 2010 was $738.2 million, compared with $331.0 million in 2009, an increase of $407.2 million or 123.0%. Operating income increased as a result of the factors described above. IMMSA unit. Change 2010 2009 Value % Net sales $ 512.7 $ 560.2 $ (47.5 ) (8.5 )% Operating costs and expenses (359.0 ) (423.3 ) 64.3 15.2 % Operating income $ 153.7 $ 136.9 $ 16.8 12.3 % Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2010 were $512.7 million, compared with $560.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $47.5 million. The decrease in 2010 was due to lower volume of copper, silver and zinc and sales by the Santa Eulalia mine primarily as a result of the decrease in production due to a flooding in the area. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $359.0 million in 2010, compared with $423.3 million in 2009, a decrease of $64.3 million. This decrease was primarily the result of $71.3 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). The decrease in cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) included $129.1 million of lower metal purchases from third parties, net of $38.0 million of higher inventory consumption. Operating income in 2010 was $153.7 million, compared with $136.9 million in 2009, an increase of $16.8 million. Operating income increased primarily as a result of the factors described above. 91 Table of Contents Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 20 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion relates to our liquidity and capital resources for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011. Liquidity The following table shows the cash flow for the three year period ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 2,070.2 $ 1,920.7 $ 963.2 Net cash used for investing activities $ (1,083.1 ) $ (473.8 ) $ (359.3 ) Net cash (used for) provided from financing activities $ (2,375.0 ) $ 36.6 $ (458.0 ) Net cash provided from operating activities: 2011-2010 In 2011, net income was $2,344.3 million, approximately 113.2% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $288.1 million which was added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $117.9 million of a deferred income tax benefit and $19.3 million of net currency translation effect, which were deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2011 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $421.6 million. The 2011 and 2010 increases (decreases) in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2011 2010 Accounts receivable $ (135.6 ) $ (308.1 ) Inventories (204.2 ) (7.3 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (184.4 ) 541.0 Other operating assets and liabilities 102.6 (121.4 ) Total $ (421.6 ) $ 104.2 The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher sales volume available resulting from the restoration of the Buenavista mine production. The increase in inventories of $204.2 million includes an increase of $118.8 million in capitalized leachable material, $25.4 million in finished goods inventory, principally due to shipping delays and $43.1 million of higher work-in process inventory, principally due to the restoration of the Buenavista mine. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to payments to suppliers and income tax payments. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2011 were a source of cash of $102.6 million. 2010 In 2010, net income was $1,562.7 million, approximately 81.4% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $281.7 million and 92 Table of Contents $13.6 million of net currency translation effect, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $40.4 million of a deferred income tax benefit, which was deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2010 a decrease in working capital increased operating cash flow by $104.2 million. The 2010 and 2009 increase (decrease) in cash from working capital includes (in millions): 2010 2009 Accounts receivable $ (308.1 ) $ (299.6 ) Inventories (7.3 ) 44.5 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 541.0 (89.1 ) Other operating assets and liabilities (121.4 ) 107.1 Total $ 104.2 $ (237.1 ) The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher metal prices at the end of 2010, compared with 2009. The LME and COMEX copper prices increased by over 46.0% in 2010, compared with 2009, and molybdenum, zinc and silver increased by 43.0%, 30.7% and 37.6%, respectively. The increase in inventories of $7.3 million includes an increase of $12.4 million in finished goods inventory, principally due to shipping delays at our Mexican operations and $40.7 million of higher work-in process inventory principally due to scheduled repairs at our smelter facilities partially offset by a higher consumption of leachable material inventory. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to an increase in workers’ participation and income tax provision due to the higher earnings. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2010 were a use of cash of $121.4 million, which was caused principally by an increase of $51.6 million in the long term income tax provision. 2009 In 2009, net income was $934.6 million, approximately 97.0% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included, depreciation, amortization and depletion of $273.6 million and $41.2 million of deferred income tax, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and ($56.8) million of the realized 2008 loss on derivative instruments, which were deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2009 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $237.2 million. Net cash used for investing activities: 2011: Net cash used for investing activities in 2011 included $612.9 million for capital expenditures, $449.5 million net purchase of short-term investment, and $33.3 million for our share of the investment in the development of the Tantahuatay gold project, less $12.6 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties. The capital expenditures included $205.7 million of investments at our Peruvian operations, $76.0 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, $38.9 million for the Cuajone concentrator expansion and $90.8 million for various other replacement expenditures. In addition, we spent $358.3 million for investments at our Mexican open-pit operations, $97.4 million for the Buenavista mine expansion, $96.7 million for the Buenavista mine rehabilitation, $13.6 for the Buenavista crusher and conveyors system, Quebalix III and $150.6 for various other replacement expenditures. Capital expenditures also included $48.9 million at our IMMSA unit. 2010: Net cash used for investing activities in 2010 included $408.7 million for capital expenditures, $66.9 million for the purchase of bonds classified as trading securities, and $21.5 million for our share of the investment in the development of the Tantahuatay gold project, less $14.7 million of proceeds from the sale of short-term investments and $8.7 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties of our Mexican operations. The capital expenditures included $260.3 million of investments at our Peruvian operations, $152.5 million for the Tia Maria project, $32.8 million for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, $18.8 million for the Cuajone concentrator expansion and $56.2 million for various other replacement expenditures. In addition, we spent $140.9 million for replacement assets at our Mexican operations, $109.8 million of which was at our Mexican open-pit operations, $29.8 million at our IMMSA unit and $8.8 million for other corporate projects, including at our administrative office in Mexico City. 2009: Net cash used for investing activities in 2009 included $414.8 million for capital expenditures, $43.8 million of proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments and $11.8 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties at our Mexican operations.

Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2012 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. On July 28, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the program, from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Since the inception of the program we have purchased 42.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $730.7 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 - SCC common stock repurchase plan. Dividend: On January 26, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.19 per share of common stock and a stock dividend of 0.0107 shares of common stock per share of SCC common stock. The stock dividend will be paid with shares of common stock held in treasury by SCC and shares held in treasury on the record date will not be entitled to either the cash or stock dividend. The cash and stock dividends are payable on February 28, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2012. New mining royalty charge: Our Peruvian operations have been subject to a 1% to 3% mining royalty charge based on sales and calculated on the value of the concentrates and SXEW copper produced at the Toquepala and Cuajone mines. We made provisions for this charge in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $52.5 million, $65.5 million and $43.7 million, respectively. In September 2011, the Peruvian Congress approved an amendment to the mining royalty charge. The new mining royalty charge is based on operating income margins with graduated rates ranging from 1% to 12%, and with a minimum royalty charge assessed at 1% of net sales. If the operating income margin is 10% or less, the royalty charge is 1% and for each 5% increment in the operating income margin, the royalty charge rate increases by 0.75%, up to a maximum of 12%. In the last quarter of 2011, we made provisions of $19.3 million for this charge. These provisions are included in “Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)” in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. Special mining tax: Additionally, in September 2011, the Peruvian Congress enacted a new tax for the mining industry. This tax is also based on operating income and its rate ranges from 2% to 8.4%. It begins at 2% for the first 10% of operating income margin and for each additional 5% of operating income margin is increased by an additional rate of 0.4% until 85% of operating income margin is reached. In the last quarter of 2011, we made provisions of $16.4 million for this tax. This provision is included as “income taxes” in the consolidated statement of earnings. Permanent reinvestment of earnings: Retained earnings of $2.0 billion generated by our Mexican subsidiary have been designated as permanently reinvested at December 31, 2011. Accordingly, we will not make distributions of such amounts 94 Table of Contents in the foreseeable future as these funds are earmarked for our Mexican capital projects. Should distribution of these funds be made by our Mexican subsidiaries we would incur in additional taxes approximately equal to the difference between the U.S. and Mexican income tax rates. As of December 31, 2011, we maintain a cash and cash equivalent balance of $771.1 million at our Mexican subsidiary. FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2011 was $2,745.7 million, compared with $2,760.4 million at December 31, 2010, net of the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $25.4 million and $26.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in total debt during 2011 was due to the amortization of $10 million of the Mitsui loan and a repurchase of Yankee bonds of $5.3 million. The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 40.5% at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.4% at December 31, 2010. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 32.0% at December 31, 2011, compared with 12.7% at December 31, 2010. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” on pages 97 and 98. On April 16, 2010, we issued $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $10.3 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. Net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our capital expenditure program. Please see Note 11 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Changes in credit risk: On January 26, 2012, S&P raised its long-term corporate credit rating of our Company, as well as of its parent companies, Grupo Mexico and Americas Mining Company, to BBB from BBB- . Also, S&P raised its ratings of our senior notes to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-’. S&P noted that this rating reflects its assessment of a satisfactory business risk profile, supported by our low cash cost structure, geographic diversity, position as the world’s sixth largest copper producer, vertical integration and long-life reserves. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. 95 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments due by Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 2,771.1 $ 10.0 $ 10.0 $ — $ 200.0 $ — $ 2,551.1 Interest on debt 4,192.4 188.6 188.3 188.3 182.9 175.4 3,268.9 Uncertain tax position(a) 67.0 Workers’ participation 251.7 251.7 Pension and post-retirement obligations 44.1 9.8 3.0 3.2 3.2 3.3 21.6 Asset retirement obligation 62.0 62.0 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,121.9 190.4 190.4 206.3 226.7 231.1 77.0 Capital expenditure projects 1,587.7 491.5 583.6 276.5 — 230.7 5.4 Total $ 10,097.9 $ 1,142.0 $ 975.3 $ 674.3 $ 612.8 $ 640.5 $ 5,986.0 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2011 the liability recognized by the Company is $67.0 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account of $25.4 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2011. As almost all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change significantly due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM. See Note 10 “Asset retirement obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. In 2009 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Enersur regarding the power supply agreement. As a result of the MOU, formulas for calculating the monthly power cost have changed, decreasing power cost vis a vis the former methodology. The new formula has been applied since May 2009 to date and will be used until the end of the contract in 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs as amended by the MOU, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Peruvian projects of the Toquepala and Cuajone concentrator expansions, as well as our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine. 96 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 76) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 2,763.2 $ 2.194 $ 2,129.0 $ 2.048 $ 1,865.8 $ 1.784 Add: Selling, general and administrative 104.5 0.083 100.3 0.096 85.2 0.081 Treatment and refining charges 46.0 0.037 55.8 0.054 42.3 0.040 By-product revenue (1) (1,538.9 ) (1.222 ) (1,380.0 ) (1.327 ) (1,013.7 ) (0.969 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (25.0 ) (0.020 ) (13.2 ) (0.013 ) (32.4 ) (0.031 ) Less: Workers’ participation (245.7 ) (0.195 ) (232.1 ) (0.223 ) (127.8 ) (0.122 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (560.4 ) (0.445 ) (280.6 ) (0.270 ) (266.6 ) (0.255 ) Royalty charge and other, net (208.3 ) (0.166 ) (203.6 ) (0.196 ) (97.3 ) (0.093 ) Inventory change 187.2 0.149 11.5 0.011 (25.2 ) (0.024 ) Operating Cash Cost $ 522.6 $ 0.415 $ 187.1 $ 0.180 $ 430.3 $ 0.411 Less by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties 1,563.9 1.242 1,393.2 1.340 1,046.1 1.000 Operating Cash Cost, without by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties $ 2,086.5 $ 1.657 $ 1,580.3 $ 1.520 $ 1,476.4 $ 1.411 Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,259.5 1,039.8 1,046.1 (1) Includes net by-product sales revenue and premiums on sales of refined products.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal price sensitivity: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated changes in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2012 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.0 Annual change in net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 7.7 $ 22.4 $ 1.1 $ 8.2 Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/exchange rate effects are passed on to us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 4.8 % 2.1 % 0.2 % Nuevo sol/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate (4.0 )% (2.8 )% (8.0 )% Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.8 % 4.4 % 3.6 % Peso/dollar devaluation/(appreciation) rate 13.1 % (5.4 )% (3.5 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate change of 10% at December 31, 2011, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our operating income as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 21.0 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (25.7 ) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 21.5 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (17.6 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2011. Interest rate risk: A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. There have been no material changes in our interest rate risk at December 31, 2011. As most of our debt is at fixed rates, a change in interest rates of 1% would not have a material impact on our cash flows. 99 Table of Contents Derivative instruments: As part of our risk management policy, we occasionally use derivative instruments to (i) safeguard corporate assets, (ii) insure the value of our future revenue stream and (iii) lessen the impact of unforeseen market swings on our sales revenues. To meet with these objectives we, from time to time, enter into commodities prices derivatives, interest rate derivatives, exchange rate derivatives and other instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposure to market risk. Copper hedges: In 2011 and 2010, we entered into copper swaps and zero cost collar derivative contracts to reduce price volatility and to protect our sales value as shown below. These transactions meet the requirements of hedge accounting. The realized gains and losses from these derivatives were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings and included in operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. We did not hold any copper derivatives in 2009. The following table summarized the copper derivative activity related to copper sales transactions realized in 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Zero cost collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) 423.3 — Average LME cap price $ 3.63 — Average LME floor price $ 2.27 — Swap contracts: Pounds (in millions) 390.8 276.7 Weighted average COMEX price $ 3.46 $ 3.79 Realized (loss) gain on copper derivatives $ 13.5 $ (41.9 ) In addition, we have a hedge program to protect the sales value of a portion of our copper production for the first quarter of 2012. The hedge instruments are based on LME copper prices. These cash flow hedge relationships qualify as critical matched terms hedge relationships and as a result have no ineffectiveness. At the end of 2011 we held copper derivative contracts to protect a portion of our copper sales for the first quarter of 2012, as follows: 1st Quarter 2012 Zero cost collar contracts: Pounds (in millions) 46.3 Average LME cap price $ 5.18 Average LME floor price $ 3.50 Estimated % of copper sales covered 13.6 % Unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income (net of income taxes of $3.5 million) (in millions) $ 5.4 We expect to reclassify into earnings during the first quarter of 2012 the unrealized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $5.4 million (net of income taxes) at the time the underlying hedged transactions are realized. However, changes in copper prices in that period could increase or decrease the amount of the gain to be reclassified into earnings. Please see additional disclosure about fair value on Note 17-“Financial Instruments.” Gas swaps: In 2009, we entered into gas swap contracts to protect the cost of our gas consumptions for 306,000 MMBTUs at a fixed price of $3.6350. No gain or loss was realized on the contracts. During 2011 and 2010, and at December 31, 2011, we did not hold any gas swap contracts. 100 Table of Contents Exchange rate derivatives, U.S. dollar / Mexican peso contracts: We occasionally enter into zero-cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting, within a range, against an appreciation of the Mexican peso to the US dollar. Related to the exchange rate derivative contracts we recorded a gain of $4.2 million in 2009 which was recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of earnings. During 2011 and 2010, and at December 31, 2011, we did not hold any exchange rate derivative contracts. Short-term investments: Short-term investments were as follows ($ in millions): At December 31, 2011 2010 Trading securities $ 514.6 $ 66.9 Weighted average interest rate 1.37 % 1.14 % Available—for- sale $ 7.3 $ 9.3 Weighted average interest rate 0.58 % 1.01 % Total $ 521.9 $ 76.2 Trading securities consist of bonds issued by public companies. Each financial instrument is independent of the others. We have the intention to sell these bonds in the short-term. Available-for-sale investments consist of securities issued by public companies. Each security is independent of the others and, as of December 31, 2011, included corporate bonds and asset and mortgage backed obligations. At December 31, 2011and 2010, gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material. Related to these investments we earned interest, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, we redeemed some of these securities and recognized gains (losses) due to changes in fair value, which were recorded as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings. The following table summarizes the activity of these investments by category (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 Trading: Interest earned $ 6.0 $ 2.6 Unrealized loss $ 7.9 — Available-for-sale: Interest earned $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Investment redeemed $ 2.1 $ 14.8 At December 31, 2011and 2010, contractual maturities of our available-for-sale debt securities are as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 One year or less $ 0.5 $ 0.4 Maturing after one year through five years — 0.2 Maturing after five years through ten years 0.6 — Due after 10 years 6.2 8.7 Total debt securities $ 7.3 $ 9.3 IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS None 101 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:21.957644

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” the” Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business” - “Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile and in 2011 we started exploration activities in Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. Net sales value in 2012 of $6.7 billion was only 2.2% lower than 2011 sales, which were the highest in our Company´s history even though the average copper price in 2012 was 10% lower and the prices for all our major by-products were lower, as well. This accomplishment was due to production increases in copper, silver and zinc. Net income decreased by about 17% as a result of the lower prices and the one time court ordered legal fee payment of $316.2 million. Without the deduction for these legal fees, 2012 net earnings would have been $2.3 billion a decrease of 3.7% from our record year of 2011. Our Buenavista mine, which is enjoying a stable work environment, reached a new production record of 200,070 tons of copper. In 2012, we invested $1,051.9 million in capital programs along with $48 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. Our copper ore reserves, at December 31, 2012, totaled 67.1 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $2.00 per pound (as of December 31, 2012, the LME and COMEX copper price was $3.59 and $3.64, respectively), as follows: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 31,177 Peruvian operations 25,589 IMMSA 213 Development projects 10,086 Total 67,065 72 Table of Contents Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · Changes in copper and molybdenum prices: The average LME and COMEX copper price was $3.61 per pound in 2012, about 10% lower than in 2011. Average silver and zinc prices in 2012 decreased about 11% and molybdenum decreased about 18% compared to 2011. · Sales structure: In the last three years approximately 75.7% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 9.0% from molybdenum, 7.0% from silver and 8.3% from various other products, including zinc, sulfuric acid, gold and other materials. · Metal markets: During the fourth quarter 2012 metal markets continued to be driven by the negative macroeconomic events that affected consumer expectations, the more significant being Europe’s debt crisis, the “fiscal cliff” that affected the U.S. economy and the slowdown of China’s economy. 2012 was also a transition year, with administration changes or elections in several key countries, including China and the United States. We believe the copper market fundamentals are sound, however, demand has been affected by macroeconomic factors and the economic slowdown noted in the previous paragraph. At present, we perceive a more positive environment as some of these matters have been solved or are perceived to have a more positive outlook from now on. In China, after several monetary easing measures were taken in the second half of 2012, some analysts expect growth in Chinese copper demand of approximately 8.5%, for 2013, better than the 5% growth estimated for 2012. According to them, China represented 41% of the world demand in 2012. The expected strong growth in China and other emerging economies should give support to the copper market in 2013. In the United States demand appears to be stronger as consumer confidence has increased and the economy is recovering. This has been reinforced by positive news related to housing and employment that seem to have offset concerns related to the fiscal balance. Even though the United States represents today about 8% of the world demand for refined copper, the recovery of its economy is key to copper demand since the United States is the most important secondary copper consumer, affecting copper demand in other economies. Finally, after a severe 2012, where European demand is estimated to have decreased by approximately 7%, there are signs indicating a copper demand increase of 2%. It should be mentioned that Europe now represents approximately 19% of the world demand for refined copper. On the supply side, we understand that several structural factors, such as labor stoppages, technical problems and other issues are still affecting copper supply, which we believe will very likely result in weak supply growth in 2013, even though we will see several projects coming into operation by year-end or in 2014. We believe SCC is positioned to take advantage of this unsettled situation, through our investment program of organic growth, aimed at increasing production from our current capacity of 640,000 tons to 1.2 million tons by 2017. · Molybdenum: we saw a 2.6% molybdenum demand growth in 2012, which helped to reduce the surplus of supply to demand from approximately 8% to 6%. We expect that in 2013 the balance between supply and demand will continue reducing the market surplus, thereby improving molybdenum prices in the near future. · Silver: we believe that silver prices will have strong support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. · Zinc: we also believe that zinc has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption; however, inventories are currently at a relatively high level, which tends to maintain a relatively weak zinc price. · Production: For 2013, we are currently expecting a copper production of 650,000 tons of which approximately 10,000 tons would be from third party copper. We expect molybdenum production in 2013 to be about 19,800 tons including approximately 1,700 tons from our new molybdenum plant at Buenavista. Additionaly, in 2013 we expect to produce and sell 16.3 million ounces of silver and produce 99,100 tons of zinc. · Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures were a record of $1,051.9 million for 2012, 71.6% higher than in 2011. The increase reflects our strong commitment to the Company’s expansion programs at Buenavista and other properties. In 73 Table of Contents 2012, $615.6 million was invested in our Buenavista projects. In 2013 we will continue our investment program to increase copper production capacity by approximately 84% by 2017, from 640,000 tons to 1.2 million tons. SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit: On October 9, 2012, we received from AMC, our majority shareholder, $2.1 billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, which concluded that we paid an excessive price to AMC in the 2005 merger between the Company and Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. From the aforementioned sum received from AMC, we paid $316.2 million to the plaintiff’s attorneys to satisfy the court ordered award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. The effect of these transactions was recorded in our 2012 results. The payment of $316.2 million attorney´s fees was recorded as an operating expense and the receipt of $2.1 billion was recorded in equity as additional paid-in capital. Financing: On November 8, 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $22.5 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. This debt was issued in two tranches, $300 million due in 2022 at an annual interest rate of 3.5% and $1.2 billion due in 2042 at an annual interest rate of 5.25%. Net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our capital expenditure program. Changes in credit risk: On December 3, 2012 Fitch Ratings upgraded the Company’s unsecured debt ratings from BBB to BBB+. Additionally, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investor Services aligned and confirmed SCC debt rating by assigning ‘BBB’ and Baa2, respectively, to the new notes issued. Tantahuatay: The Tantahuatay mine is located in Cajamarca, in northern Peru. Production started in August 2011 and the mine produced 140,262 ounces of gold and 914,241 ounces of silver in 2012. For 2013, the current plan is to produce 116,300 ounces of gold and 476,000 ounces of silver. We hold a 44.2% interest in this mine. In 2012, we have recognized $48.7 million in earnings (see caption Equity earnings of affiliate, on our Statement of Earnings) for our share of the net income of the mine. Peru labor negotiations: We conducted negotiations with eight Peruvian unions whose collective bargaining agreements expired in 2012. During the first two months of 2013, we have signed three-year agreements with all the unions.The agreements include, among other things, annual salary increases of 6.5%, 5% and 5% for each of the three years, respectively, for all workers. There were no strikes during 2011 and 2010. On December 24 and 25, 2012, the three major unions held a two-day illegal work stoppage which did not have a material impact on production. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues, and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2012: 2012 2011 2010 Net sales (in millions) $ 6,669 $ 6,819 $ 5,150 Net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 1,935 $ 2,336 $ 1,554 Earnings per share $ 2.28 $ 2.73 $ 1.81 Dividends per share $ 4.06 $ 2.43 $ 1.66 Average LME copper price $ 3.61 $ 4.00 $ 3.42 Pounds of copper sold (in millions) 1,415 1,320 1,106 Prices for copper and all our major by-products were lower in 2012 and we absorbed a charge of $316.2 million in 2012 for legal fees paid in connection with the SCC shareholder derivative litigation. Because of higher production and sales volume of our metals we were able to record good results for 2012, with net earnings of $1.9 billion. 74 Table of Contents Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2012: 2012 2011 2010 Copper (in million pounds) 1,406 1,295 1,055 Molybdenum (in million pounds) 40 41 45 Zinc (in million pounds) 198 185 219 Silver (in million ounces) 14 13 13 2012 compared with 2011: Mined copper in 2012 increased 111 million pounds, compared to 2011 production. The 8.5% increase was due to higher production at our Mexican mines and includes an additional 60.8 million pounds at the Buenavista mine, which had record production in 2012, 15.5 million pounds at the La Caridad mine, and 41.1 million pounds of higher production at the Cuajone mine. These increases in production were the result of higher ore grades and recoveries, and were partially offset by lower production at the Toquepala mine, whose production decreased by 2.2% mainly due to lower PLS copper grade and volume processed at the SXEW plant. Molybdenum production decreased slightly in 2012, compared with 2011, due primarily to 2.0 million pounds of lower production at the Toquepala mine, as a result of lower ore grades and recoveries, offset by 1.2 million pounds and 0.2 million pounds of higher production at La Caridad mine and Cuajone mine, respectively. Zinc mine production, which comes from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, increased by 13.4 million pounds in 2012, 7.3% higher than in 2011, mainly as a result of higher recoveries and the production recovery at the Santa Eulalia mine after the flooding problems of prior years were resolved. Our silver production increased 7.2% in 2012, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine and the Cuajone mine, offset somewhat by lower production at some of our other mines. 2011 compared with 2010: Mined copper in 2011 increased 240 million pounds or 22.8% over the 2010 production principally due to higher production at our Buenavista mine. The Buenavista mine restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and increased production by 335 million pounds. Decreases at our Peruvian mines of 85 million pounds, largely from lower ore grade at the Cuajone mine and a decrease of 10 million pounds at La Caridad mine, due to lower grades and recoveries, partially offset the increase from Buenavista. Molybdenum production decreased by approximately 4 million pounds in 2011, 9.5% lower than in 2010, due primarily to 5.5 million pounds of lower production at the Cuajone mine, partially offset by 1.2 million of higher production at the Toquepala mine both due to changes in recoveries, and lower ore grades at Cuajone mine. Zinc mine production, which comes from our IMMSA unit in Mexico decreased by 34 million pounds in 2011, 15.5% lower than in 2010, principally due to no production at the Santa Eulalia mine, as a result of a flooding caused by heavy rains, and decreases in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines of 19 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades. Our silver production increased slightly in 2011, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine mostly offset by lower production at some of our other mines. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” on page 96. We have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), less the cost of purchased concentrates, plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges, net 75 Table of Contents revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties and by-product revenues, and sales premiums; less workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including the Peruvian royalty charge, the special mining tax and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by-products: molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold and other minor by- products and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales. We account for the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We also include copper sales premiums as a credit, as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices. The increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum, as well as increases in the prices of silver and zinc, have had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods. Accordingly, we present cash costs with and without crediting the by-product revenues against our costs. We exclude the cost of purchases of third party copper material. From time to time we purchase copper concentrates on the open market in order to maximize the use of our metallurgical facilities or to take advantage of an attractive market situation. We view these purchases on an incremental basis and measure the results incrementally. We find that the inclusion of these purchases with our own production often creates a distortion in our unit cost. Accordingly, we include only the net effect of these purchases as a by-product credit, so that only the net revenue or loss from the transaction is included in the calculation. We believe this will allow others to see a truer presentation of our cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge and special mining tax. Our operating cash costs per pound, as defined, are presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2012. Year Variance (Dollars per pound) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-products revenue $ 1.796 $ 1.759 $ 1.620 $ 0.037 $ 0.139 Add: by-product revenues $ (1.083 ) $ (1.242 ) $ (1.340 ) $ 0.159 $ 0.098 Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced $ 0.713 $ 0.517 $ 0.280 $ 0.196 $ 0.237 2012 compared with 2011: As seen on the chart above, operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was 3.7 cents per pound higher than in 2011, an increase of 2.1%, mainly due to increases in fuel and power cost. Operating cash cost per pound, net of by-product credits, was 19.6 cents per pound higher than in 2011, largely as a result of lower prices for our major by-products, which decreased between 11% and 18% in the period. 2011 compared with 2010: Our cash cost per pound , excluding by-product revenues, was higher by 13.9 cents per pound in 2011, compared with 2010, principally due to higher production cost, mainly power and fuel cost due to increased market prices, labor due to salary increases and repair costs, partially offset by the higher production from the Buenavista mine. Our cash cost per pound for 2011 when calculated with by-product revenues was 51.7 cents per pound, compared with 28.0 cents per pound in 2010. The increase was due to some cost inflation, mainly fuel and power and lower by-product credit largely due to lower molybdenum sales volume and price. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is influenced by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metal prices 76 Table of Contents historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to financial investments. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated 2013 net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 8.0 $ 25.7 $ 1.3 $ 9.6 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and the Buenavista mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” and also in Note 19 “Segment and related information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/exchange rate effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 2.6 % 4.8 % 2.1 % Nuevo sol/dollar appreciation / (devaluation) rate 5.4 % 4.0 % 2.8 % Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.6 % 3.8 % 4.4 % Peso/dollar appreciation / (devaluation) rate 6.9 % (13.1 )% 5.4 % Capital Investment Program We made capital expenditures of $1,051.9 million, $612.9 million and $408.7 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In general, the capital expenditures and investment projects described below are intended to increase production and/or decrease costs. 77 Table of Contents The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2012 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Peruvian projects: Tia Maria — Arequipa $ 7.8 $ 1.6 $ 152.5 Toquepala expansion projects 32.7 76.0 32.8 Cuajone expansion projects 52.0 38.9 18.8 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 1.3 0.7 3.3 Ilo smelter modernization (including marine trestle) — — 1.6 Ilo power transmission substation 11.9 9.8 — Sub-total projects 105.7 127.0 209.0 Maintenance and replacement 152.2 78.5 55.2 Total Peruvian expenditures 257.9 205.5 264.2 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine expansion $ 216.3 $ 97.4 $ — New Buenavista concentrator 149.0 7.7 — Buenavista projects infrastructure 69.1 9.0 Buenavista SXEW plant III 138.3 6.5 — Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material, phase III 16.1 13.6 — Buenavista molybdenum plant 17.0 1.2 — Buenavista mine and facilities rehabilitation — 96.7 35.0 El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 1.5 9.4 14.1 La Caridad tailings dam — internal dikes — — 4.3 Santa Eulalia pumping system 4.9 9.6 3.2 Angangueo 3.6 6.5 — Sub-total projects 615.8 257.6 56.6 Maintenance and replacement 178.2 149.8 87.9 Total Mexican expenditures 794.0 407.4 144.5 Total capital expenditures $ 1,051.9 $ 612.9 $ 408.7 We are committed to continuing the growth of our Company. In 2013, we will continue our investment program aimed at increasing copper production capacity by approximately 84% from 640,000 tons to 1.2 million tons by 2017. We have budgeted $1.8 billion in spending for the year. Spending in Mexico is estimated to be $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion for our Buenavista projects, and $0.4 billion in Peru. These investments are part of our five-year capital investment program to increase production of copper and molybdenum. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in the economy or market conditions. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. Peruvian operations: Toquepala projects: Through December 31, 2012, we have spent $231.8 million on the Toquepala projects. These expenses include mine equipment used for the initial stripping of the mine expansion , the initial construction work and planning to build a new crusher and a conveyor belt system to replace rail hauling and other costs. The expenses are designed to allow for future savings. The projects include the increase in milling capacity of the Toquepala concentrator from 60,000 tons per day to 120,000 tons, which should increase annual production by 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum. As a result of protests from some community groups the approval process for the EIA of this project has been delayed. These groups raised concerns related to water usage and pollution. As a result of these issues the Peruvian government has started discussions with the local communities and the regional authorities to resolve this impasse. On February 8, 2013, we reached a final agreement with the province of Candarave, one of the three provinces neighboring our Toquepala unit, which commits us to funding S/.255 million (approximately $98 million) for development projects in the province. This agreement is contingent upon receiving approval for the project. We expect to continue working with the Candarave province and the other two provinces neighboring Toquepala to resolve all open issues during 2013. Assuming we receive approval of the EIA on a timely basis, project completion is scheduled for the first half of 2015. 78 Table of Contents Cuajone projects: Through December 31, 2012, we have spent $136.6 million on two projects related to this unit’s production plans: the Variable Cut-off Ore Grade project and the HPGR project. Current production is showing the initial benefits of the variable cut-off project. We expect that both projects will be at full capacity by the second half of 2013. When finished, the project will increase average copper production by 22,000 tons per year. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam are finished. We are preparing bidding documents for the second stage that includes engineering and procurement to improve and increase the dam’s embankment. The project has a total budgeted cost of $66.0 million with $49.0 million expended through December 31, 2012. Tia Maria project: We continue to work on a new EIA study that will address recent government guidance on these studies, in order to reach an agreement that is mutually satisfactory to all parties. We expect to submit it to the authorities during the first half of 2013. We are also working with our stakeholders in order to develop a social program for the benefit of the local communities. We are confident that this initiative will have a positive effect on our stakeholders and will allow us to obtain approval for the development of the 120,000 ton annual production copper project. As a consequence, we are rescheduling the project start up to the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, some of the equipment already purchased was assigned to our operations at Buenavista, Toquepala, and Cuajone. Mexican operations: Buenavista Projects: We continue the development of our $2.8 billion investment program at this unit which will allow us to increase its production capacity by approximately 170%. The table below contains a summary of the program’s progress: Project Overall progress Estimated start-up New concentrator with molybdenum circuit 36.1 % First half 2015 Mine equipment 2011-2015 51.6 % SXEW III 38.5 % First half 2014 Quebalix III 99.7 % First quarter 2013 Molybdenum plant 87.1 % First quarter 2013 The new concentrator with molybdenum circuit project includes a concentrator with an estimated annual production capacity of 188,000 tons of copper, and a 1,850 tons capacity molybdenum plant. The project also is estimated to produce annually 2.3 million ounces of silver and 21,000 ounces of gold. The total capital budget of the project is $1,383.6 million. Through December 31, 2012, we have received two of eight shovels, 37 of 56 trucks and seven of eight drills. All acquired units are currently in operation. The total capital budget of the mine equipment project is $504.8 million. The SXEW III project is moving forward. Plant equipment from Tia Maria has been transported to Mexico and will allow us to increase the annual plant capacity from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The total capital budget of the project is $444.0 million. The final testing of the Quebalix project concluded in February 2013, and the project is scheduled to start operations by the end of the first quarter 2013. This project consists of a crushing, conveying and spreading system that improves the SXEW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing hauling cost and the required time to extract copper from mineral. The construction of a molybdenum plant for the current concentrator is also moving forward. The final testing of the plant is scheduled to start by the end of the first quarter of 2013. It is expected to have an annual average production of 2,000 tons of molybdenum. Angangueo: The project is moving forward as scheduled to develop this underground polymetallic deposit in Michoacan, Mexico. With an estimated investment of $174.7 million, Angangueo includes a concentrator plant which will have an estimated average annual metal content production of 10,400 tons of copper and 7,000 tons of zinc in the first seven years. Over the life of the mine, average annual concentrate production is expected to contain 2.4 million ounces of silver and 1,500 ounces of gold. The project is scheduled to begin production in the first half of 2015. 79 Table of Contents Pilares project: In 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Pilares, with the intention of operating it as an open-pit facility. In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the development of the Pilares mine, with a budget of $136.3 million. Current mineralized material is estimated at 43.4 million tons with 0.789% of copper sulfide content and 0.077% copper oxide. We expect to increase copper production by 40,000 tons per year by sending mineral from the Pilares site to our La Caridad concentrator. Pilares is currently on hold while we solve a “right of way” issue with the local community. El Arco: El Arco is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 1.5 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.416% and 0.14 grams of gold per ton. In 2010, we concluded the feasibility study and an investment of $56.4 million was approved for land acquisition required for the project. This project, when developed, is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. In 2013, we will continue to invest in land acquisition required for the project. Exploration projects: We have a number of exploration projects that we may develop in the future. We are currently involved in active exploration activities in Peru, Mexico, Chile and more recently in Ecuador and Argentina. For more information regarding our exploration activities, please see “Exploration Activities” in part I, Item 1. Business. We have a number of projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, environmental concerns, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.00 per pound for copper and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use the following average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31: 80 Table of Contents 2012 2011 2010 Copper ($ per pound) $ 3.68 $ 3.26 $ 2.97 Molybdenum ($ per pound) $ 14.52 $ 13.95 $ 18.59 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices, for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves will not change significantly. Please see Item 2- Properties - caption “Ore reserves.” Long-term inventory - Leachable Material: The leaching process is an integral part of to the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. The cost attributed to the leach material is charged to cost of sales generally over a five-year period (the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine). However, change in the five year-cycle generally would not have a material impact on our financial results as our production is largely from non-leach material. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix fuel prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates and currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar conversion rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings as follows: copper and zinc derivatives are included in net sales, gain and losses related to fuel costs are included in cost of sales and all other are included in “Gain (loss) on 81 Table of Contents derivative instruments.” Changes in the fair value of copper derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in sales as the hedged copper sales occur. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Tax” to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $3.00 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $12.00 per pound, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $1.50 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $10.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.17 to 7.40 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. 82 Table of Contents PROVISIONALLY PRICED SALES The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Provisionally Priced Sales 2012 2011 2010 Copper Millions of pounds 19.7 64.3 13.8 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 3.59 $ 3.44 $ 4.38 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 8.8 10.3 9.1 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 11.60 $ 13.35 $ 16.40 Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Provisional Sales Adjustments 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Copper $ 2.9 $ 1.4 $ 4.8 Molybdenum 3.7 (3.4 ) 7.3 Total $ 6.6 $ (2.0 ) $ 12.1 Management believes that the final pricing of these sales will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Sales of by-products in 2012 totaled $1,532.4 million, compared with $1,589.2 million in 2011, a decrease of 3.6%. The decrease of $56.8 million is attributable to lower metals prices for all of our major by-products somewhat reduced by increased volume of silver and zinc sales. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Year Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2012 2011 Molybdenum 6.8 % 8.0 % Silver 7.4 % 7.2 % Zinc 2.9 % 3.1 % Other by-products 5.9 % 5.0 % Total 23.0 % 23.3 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2012 was $2,769.3 million, compared with $2,763.2 million in 2011, an increase of $6.1 million. Please see details on segment operating income information. Legal fees related to the SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit On October 9, 2012, we received from AMC, our majority shareholder, $2.1 billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the Court of Chancery of Delaware which concluded that we paid an excessive price to AMC in the 2005 merger between the Company and Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. From the aforementioned sum received from AMC, we paid $316.2 million to the plaintiff’s attorneys to satisfy the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Depreciation, amortization and depletion Depreciation, amortization and depletion in 2012 was $325.7 million, compared with $288.1 million in 2011, an increase of $37.6 million. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of mine and other equipment for our Mexican and Peruvian operations. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2012 was $172.4 million, compared with $186.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $14.2 million. Total interest, however increased by $9.4 million in 2012 as a result of the new debt issued in November 2012. Capitalized interest in 2012 increased by $23.5 million, principally due to the Buenavista capital investment program. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was an income of $21.8 million in 2012, compared with an expense of $4.0 million in 2011. The $25.8 million increase in other income in 2012 includes: · $18.2 million gain on sale of our shares of Compañia Internacional Minera, a Mexican mining company in which we had a minority participation, and. · $10.6 million of net gain on short-term investment due to an increase in mark to market value. 85 Table of Contents Income taxes Income taxes in 2012 were $1,080.9 million and include $1,042.2 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $38.7 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2011 were $1,104.3 million and include $1,152.4 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $48.1 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The effective tax rate for 2012 was 36.3%, compared with 32.0% in 2011. The increase in the rate is primarily due to $316.2 million of a one-time payment of legal fees related to the SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit, which is being treated as a non-deductible expense. Equity earnings of affiliate In 2012, we have recognized $48.7 million of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. In addition during 2012 we received cash dividends from this affiliate of $18.2 million. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2012 was $6.7 million, compared with $7.9 million in 2011, a decrease of $1.2 million or 15.2%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2012 was $1,934.6 million, compared with $2,336.4 million in 2011, a decrease of $401.8 million. Net income attributable to SCC decreased mainly as a result of the decrease in metal prices and other factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2012 vs.2011: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2012 2011 Value % Net sales $ 2,952.3 $ 3,186.5 $ (234.2 ) (7.3 )% Operating costs and expenses (1,603.9 ) (1,644.4 ) 40.5 (2.5 )% Operating income $ 1,348.4 $ 1,542.1 $ (193.7 ) (12.6 )% Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2012 were $2,952.3 million, compared with $3,186.5 million in 2011, a decrease of $234.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the price of copper and of our major by-products. The LME copper price was 9.8% lower in 2012 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the molybdenum and silver prices were 17.7% and 11.3% lower, respectively. Net sales in 2011 also included a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.9 million. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2012 were $1,603.9 million, compared with $1,644.2 million in 2011, a decrease of $40.5 million, principally due to $60.5 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), partially offset by $19.7 million of higher depreciation, amortization and depletion. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,380.5 million in 2012, compared with $1,441.0 million in 2011. The decrease of $60.5 million was primarily the result of: · $ 287.4 million of lower cost of concentrates purchased from third parties, partially offset by, · $ 38.1 million of higher fuel and power cost, · $ 15.8 million of higher labor cost, · $ 98.9 million of higher operating and repair material cost, and · $ 57.8 million of higher inventory consumption. 86 Table of Contents Mexican Open-pit Operations Change 2012 2011 Value % Net sales $ 3,338.5 $ 3,212.1 $ 126.4 3.9 % Operating costs and expenses (1,413.4 ) (1,287.0 ) (126.4 ) 9.8 % Operating income $ 1,925.1 $ 1,925.1 — — Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2012 were $3,338.5 million, compared with $3,212.1 million in 2011, an increase of $126.4 million. This increase is largely the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista, which had a production record of 441.0 million pounds of copper, partially offset by lower prices for copper and for our principal by-products. Net sales in 2011 also included a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.6 million. There were no gains or losses on copper derivatives in 2012. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2012 were $1,413.4 million, compared with $1,287.0 million in 2011, an increase of $126.4 million. The increase was the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2012 of $112.4 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,228.2 million in 2012, compared with $1,115.8 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to: · $127.2 million of higher production cost, including fuel, power and labor costs, · $ 21.9 million for higher workers’ participation due to the increase in earnings. · $ 48.1 million of currency translation effect due to the appreciation of the Mexican peso. · $ 42.7 million of higher inventory consumption, partially offset by, · $(53.0) million of higher leachable material capitalization and · $(76.9) million of 2011 restoration cost and other costs. IMMSA unit Change 2012 2011 Value % Net sales $ 513.6 $ 546.2 $ (32.6 ) (6.0 )% Operating costs and expenses (360.4 ) (370.5 ) 10.1 (2.7 )% Operating income $ 153.2 $ 175.7 $ (22.5 ) (12.8 )% Net sales at our IMMSA unit in 2012 were $513.6 million, compared with $546.2 million in 2011, a decrease of $32.6 million. The decrease of $32.6 million was due to lower metal prices of zinc and silver, partially offset by higher zinc sales volume mainly from the Santa Eulalia mine which restored production after resolving its prior years flooding problems. Operating costs and expenses at our IMMSA unit were $360.4 million in 2012, compared with $370.5 million in 2011, a decrease of $10.1 million. This decrease was primarily the result of $16.9 million of lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) net of $6.2 million of higher exploration expenses. Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account. Please see Note 19 “Segment and Related Information” of our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010. Net sales Net sales in 2011 were a record $6,818.7 million, compared with $5,149.5 million in 2010, an increase of $1,669.2 million. The increase was principally the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista production which restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and higher copper, silver and zinc prices. The increase in metal prices was the result of improvements in the global economy and the demand and supply balance. Net sales in 2011 include a gain of $13.5 million on copper hedges, compared with a loss of $41.9 million in 2010. 87 Table of Contents The table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products for the years 2011 and 2010. Copper Sales (million pounds) 2011 2010 Refined 795.8 637.2 Blister — — Anode 23.0 38.6 Concentrates and other 41.7 135.2 SXEW 218.0 167.4 Rod 242.0 127.7 Total 1,320.5 1,106.1 Copper made up 76.7% of net sales in 2011, compared with 72.7% in 2010. Sales of by-products in 2011 totaled $1,589.2 million, compared with $1,403.7 million in 2010, an increase of 13.2%. The increase of $185.5 million is principally attributable to higher silver price which increased 74.3% from $20.18 per ounce to $35.18 per ounce in 2011. The table below provides the sales of our by-products as a percentage of our total net sales. Years Ended December 31, By-product Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2011 2010 Molybdenum 8.0 % 13.3 % Silver 7.2 % 6.0 % Zinc 3.1 % 4.1 % Other by-products 5.0 % 3.9 % Total 23.3 % 27.3 % Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) Our cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2011 was $2,763.2 million, compared with $2,129.0 million in 2010, an increase of $634.2 million, or 29.8%. The increase in cost of sales was principally attributable to the restoration of our Buenavista property to full production, the higher amount and cost of third-party concentrates used in 2011 and the increase in cost of fuel, power and operating and repair material. These increases were partially offset by an increase in leach material inventory of $160.3 million in 2011. Buenavista’s production cost increased by $268.7 million in 2011, in part caused by the repair expense to reestablish the operation, an increase of $9.3 million over 2010 and the balance due to the operational cost. The cost of third-party concentrates increased by $279.8 million over 2010, as 51,319 tons were purchased in 2011, an increase of 26,730 tons from 2010 principally at our Peruvian operations, additionally, the 2011 cost of the purchased concentrates was higher due to the higher copper price in 2011. Fuel and power cost, excluding Buenavista’s consumption, increased by $93.3 million in 2011. Interest expense, net Net interest expense in 2011 was $186.6 million, compared with $160.5 million in 2010, an increase of $26.1 million. Interest expense increased in 2011 as a result of a full year interest expense on the $1.5 billion in fixed-rate unsecured notes issued in April 2010 and an increase in the rate of the Mitsui loan. Capitalized interest was $5.9 million and $7.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income Interest income in 2011 was $13.8 million, compared with $7.8 million in 2010, an increase of $6.0 million. Our interest income increased as a result of higher average interest rates on investments. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) was an expense of $4.0 million in 2011, compared with an expense of $20.7 million in 2010. The $16.7 million decrease in other expenses in 2011 includes: 1) $14.8 million for a contribution to the regional development at our Peruvian operations in 2010, there was no contribution in 2011 as the obligation expired in 2010, 2) 88 Table of Contents $6.9 million of higher income from scrap sales in 2011, 3) $4.7 million gain on net sales value of non-operating assets, in 2011, partially offset by 4) $8.3 million of loss on short term investments. Income taxes Income taxes in 2011 were $1,104.3 million and include $1,152.4 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and a benefit of $48.1 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income taxes in 2010 were $868.1 million and include $838.3 million of Peruvian and Mexican income taxes and $29.8 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes. U.S. income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income and limitations placed on the use of available tax credits (both foreign tax credits and the minimum tax credit). The effective tax rate for 2011 was 32.0%, compared with 35.7% in 2010. The decrease in the rate is primarily due to the recognition of additional foreign tax credits reported and the increase in the allowable amount of percentage depletion claimed in the current and prior years. The benefit provided by additional foreign tax credit and percentage depletion were partially offset by the 2011 accrual of U.S. tax on unremitted earnings of the Mexican subsidiaries. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2011 was $7.9 million, compared with $8.7 million in 2010, a decrease of $0.8 million or 8.4%. This decrease is the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2011 was $2,336.4 million, compared with $1,554.0 million in 2010, an increase of $782.4 million. Net income attributable to SCC increased largely as a result of the restoration of production at the Buenavista mine and higher metal prices and other factors described above. Segment Operating Income Information — 2011 vs.2010: Peruvian Open-pit Operations Change 2011 2010 Value % Net sales $ 3,186.5 $ 3,125.9 $ 60.6 1.9 % Operating costs and expenses (1,644.4 ) (1,406.2 ) (238.2 ) (16.9 )% Operating income $ 1,542.1 $ 1,719.7 $ (177.6 ) (10.3 )% Net sales at our Peruvian operations in 2011 were $3,186.5 million, compared with $3,125.9 million in 2010, an increase of $60.6 million. This increase was primarily due to the increase in metal prices. The LME copper price was 17.0% higher in 2011 (the majority of the copper sales of our Peruvian operations are priced on the LME) and the silver price was 74.3% higher. The price increases were offset by the lower sales volume of copper, molybdenum and silver which reduced our sales by approximately $422.3 million. 694.6 million pounds of copper were sold in 2011 compared with 792.4 million pounds of copper in 2010 as a result of lower production largely due to lower ore grade at the Cuajone mine. Net sales in 2011 also include a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.9 million while in 2010, net sales include a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $27.7 million. Operating costs and expenses at our Peruvian operations in 2011 were $1,644.4 million, compared with $1,406.2 million in 2010, an increase of $238.2 million principally due to higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion). Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,441.0 million in 2011, compared with $1,206.2 million in 2010. The increase of $234.8 million was primarily the result of 1) $139.5 million of higher production cost principally due to $66.7 million of higher cost of fuel and power due to increases in market prices, $16.7 million of higher labor cost, and $56.1 million of higher operating and repair cost mainly due to repairs at our Ilo smelter 89 Table of Contents plant, 2) $186.1 million for the higher cost of concentrates purchased from third parties, partially offset by 3) $42.6 million of lower workers’ participation due to a lower taxable income and 4) $42.9 million of leachable material inventory. Mexican Open-pit Operations. Change 2011 2010 Value % Net sales $ 3,212.1 $ 1,648.5 $ 1,563.6 94.8 % Operating costs and expenses (1,287.0 ) (910.5 ) (376.5 ) (41.4 )% Operating income $ 1,925.1 $ 738.0 $ 1,187.1 160.9 % Net sales at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2011 were $3,212.1million, compared with $1,648.5 million in 2010, an increase of $1,563.6 million. This increase is largely the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista production, which restored full capacity in the second quarter of 2011 and represented approximately $1,079.3 million of higher sales, and higher copper and silver prices. Net sales in 2011 also include a gain on copper hedge derivatives of $6.6 million while in 2010, net sales included a loss on copper hedge derivatives of $14.3 million. Operating costs and expenses at our Mexican open-pit operations in 2011 were $1,287.0 million, compared with $910.5 million in 2010, an increase of $376.5 million. The increase was the result of higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) in 2011 of $364.1 million. Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) was $1,115.8 million in 2011, compared with $751.7 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to 1) $337.9 million of higher production cost also due to the full restoration of the Buenavista production, 2) $74.2 million for the higher cost of metal purchased and 3) $55.7 million for higher workers’ participation due to the increase in earnings. These increases were partially offset by $117.4 million of capitalization of leachable material. IMMSA unit.

Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $325.7 million and $55.8 million of a deferred income tax, which were added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $18.2 million of a gain on sale of investment, which was deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2012 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $297.0 million, as detailed above. The increase in inventories of $180.7 million includes an increase of $157.0 million in capitalized leachable material and $31.8 million of higher supplies inventory. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to higher income tax payments. 2011 In 2011, net income was $2,344.3 million, approximately 112.7% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $288.1 million which was added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $117.9 million of a deferred income tax benefit, which was deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. In addition, in 2011 an increase in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $411.9 million. The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher sales volume resulting from the restoration of the Buenavista mine production. The increase in inventories of $194.5 million includes an increase of $118.8 million in capitalized leachable material, $25.4 million in finished goods inventory, principally due to shipping delays and $43.1 million of higher work-in process inventory, principally due to the restoration of the Buenavista mine. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to payments to suppliers and income tax payments. 2010 In 2010, net income was $1,562.7 million, approximately 81.4% of the net operating cash flow. Significant items added to or (deducted from) to arrive at operating cash flow included depreciation, amortization and depletion of $281.7 million, which was added back to net income in determining operating cash flow, and $40.4 million of a deferred income tax benefit, which was deducted from net income in determining operating cash flow. 91 Table of Contents In addition, in 2010 a decrease in working capital increased operating cash flow by $104.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable value was principally due to higher metal prices at the end of 2010, compared with 2009. The LME and COMEX copper prices increased by over 46.0% in 2010, compared with 2009, and molybdenum, zinc and silver increased by 43.0%, 30.7% and 37.6%, respectively. The increase in inventories of $7.3 million includes an increase of $12.4 million in finished goods inventory, principally due to shipping delays at our Mexican operations and $40.7 million of higher work-in process inventory, principally due to scheduled repairs at our smelter facilities partially offset by higher consumption of leachable material inventory. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to an increase in workers’ participation and income tax provision due to the higher earnings. Other operating assets and liabilities in 2010 were a use of cash of $121.4 million, which was caused principally by an increase of $51.6 million in the long term income tax provision. Net cash used for investing activities: 2012: Net cash used for investing activities in 2012 included $1,051.9 million for capital expenditures, $152.4 million for the purchase of short-term investments and $37.6 million for a loan to an affiliated company, less $540.1 million of proceeds on the sales of short-term investments, $18.2 million from the sale of investment and $15.1 million of proceeds from the sale of inactive properties.

In addition, we spent $137.0 million for replacement assets at our Mexican operations, $109.8 million of which was at our Mexican open-pit operations, $29.8 million at our IMMSA unit and $4.9 million for other corporate projects, including at our administrative office in Mexico City. Net cash provided from (used for) financing activities: 2012: Net cash provided from financing activities was $278.1 million and included $1,477.5 million from the issuance of new debt, $2,108.2 million from the payment related to the SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit, reduced by a dividend distribution of $3,140.0 million, $147.3 million for the repurchase of 4.4 million shares of our common stock, a debt repayment of $10 million, and a $3.6 million distribution to our non-controlling interest investors. 2011: Net cash used for financing activities was $2,375.0 million and included a dividend distribution of $2,080.4 million, $273.7 million for the repurchase of 9 million shares of our common stock, a debt repayment of $15.3 million and $6.9 million for the distribution to our non-controlling interest investors. 92 Table of Contents 2010: Net cash provided from financing activities was $36.6 million and included $1,480.8 million from the issuance of fixed-rate unsecured notes, net of debt issuance cost of $8.8 million, less a dividend distribution of $1,428.0 million, a debt repayment of $10.0 million and distributions to our non-controlling interest investors of $6.5 million. Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2013 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. In 2011, the Board approved an increase of the SCC share repurchase program, from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Since the inception of the program we have purchased 46.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $878.1 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 - SCC common stock repurchase plan. Dividend: On January 24, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock paid on February 26, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2013. SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit: On October 9, 2012, we received from AMC, our majority shareholder, $2.1 billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the Court of Chancery of Delaware which concluded that we paid an excessive price to AMC in the 2005 merger between the Company and Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. From the aforementioned sum received from AMC, we paid $316.2 million to the plaintiff’s attorneys to satisfy the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. The effect of these transactions was recorded in our 2012 results. FINANCING On November 8, 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $22.5 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. This debt was issued in two tranches, $300 million due in 2022 at an annual interest rate of 3.5% and $1.2 billion due in 2042 at an annual interest rate of 5.25%. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our capital expenditure program. Our total debt at December 31, 2012 was $4,213.9 million, compared with $2,745.7 million at December 31, 2011, net of the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $47.3 million and $25.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in total debt during 2012 was due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate unsecured notes that was reduced by the scheduled $10 million payment on the Mitsui loan. The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 46.8% at December 31, 2012, compared to 40.5% at December 31, 2011. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 26.8% at December 31, 2012, compared with 32.0% at December 31, 2011. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. Please see Note 10 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. 93 Table of Contents Changes in credit risk: On December 3, 2012 Fitch Ratings upgraded the Company’s unsecured debt ratings from BBB to BBB+. Additionally, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investor Services aligned and confirmed SCC debt rating by assigning ‘BBB’ and Baa2, respectively, to the new notes issued. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012: Payments due by Period Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 4,261.1 $ 10.0 — $ 200.0 — — $ 4,051.1 Interest on debt 5,988.3 261.7 $ 261.9 256.3 $ 249.1 $ 248.9 4,710.4 Uncertain tax position(a) 214.9 Workers’ participation 251.7 251.7 Pension and post-retirement obligations 44.9 11.2 3.2 3.4 3.4 3.6 20.1 Asset retirement obligation 118.2 118.2 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 1,185.6 200.6 208.6 288.0 360.4 128.0 — Capital expenditure projects 621.0 461.9 159.1 — — — — Total $ 12,685.7 $ 1,197.1 $ 632.8 $ 747.7 $ 612.9 $ 380.5 $ 8,899.8 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2012 the liability recognized by the Company is $214.9 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account of $47.3 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2012. As almost all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change significantly due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 11 “Benefit Plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation.” 94 Table of Contents We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Peruvian projects of the Toquepala and Cuajone concentrator expansions, as well as our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine. NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 76) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2012 2011 2010 $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 2,769.2 $ 2.010 $ 2,763.2 $ 2.194 $ 2,129.0 $ 2.048 Add: Selling, general and administrative 101.3 0.074 104.5 0.083 100.3 0.096 Treatment and refining charges 53.0 0.038 46.0 0.037 55.8 0.054 By-product revenue (1) (1,472.3 ) (1.069 ) (1,538.9 ) (1.222 ) (1,380.0 ) (1.327 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (18.8 ) (0.014 ) (25.0 ) (0.020 ) (13.2 ) (0.013 ) Less: Workers’ participation (268.6 ) (0.195 ) (245.7 ) (0.195 ) (232.1 ) (0.223 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (241.9 ) (0.176 ) (560.4 ) (0.445 ) (280.6 ) (0.270 ) Royalty charge and other, net (88.0 ) (0.063 ) (85.3 ) (0.068 ) (99.8 ) (0.096 ) Inventory change 148.8 0.108 192.2 0.153 11.5 0.011 Operating Cash Cost $ 982.7 $ 0.713 $ 650.6 $ 0.517 $ 290.9 $ 0.280 Less by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties 1,491.1 1.083 1,563.9 1.242 1,393.2 1.340 Operating Cash Cost, without by-product revenue and net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties $ 2,473.8 $ 1.796 $ 2,214.5 $ 1.759 $ 1,684.1 $ 1.620 Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,377.4 1,259.5 1,039.8 (1) Includes net by-product sales revenue and premiums on sales of refined products.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal price sensitivity: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, and giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated changes in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in 2013 as provided in the table below: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.0 Annual change in net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 8.0 $ 25.7 $ 1.3 $ 9.6 Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation/deflation in Peru or Mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, respectively, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation/exchange rate effects are passed on to us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Peru Peruvian inflation rate 2.6 % 4.8 % 2.1 % Nuevo sol/dollar appreciation / (devaluation) rate 5.4 % 4.0 % 2.8 % Mexico Mexican inflation rate 3.6 % 3.8 % 4.4 % Peso/dollar appreciation / (devaluation) rate 6.9 % (13.1 )% 5.4 % Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate change of 10% at December 31, 2012, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our operating income as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 2.5 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (3.0 ) Appreciation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 34.6 Devaluation of 10% in exchange rate of U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (28.3 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2012. Interest rate risk: A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. There have been no material changes in our interest rate risk at December 31, 2012. As most of our debt is at fixed rates, a change in interest rates of 1% would not have a material impact on our cash flows. 97 Table of Contents Derivative instruments: As part of our risk management policy, we occasionally use derivative instruments to (i) safeguard corporate assets, (ii) insure the value of our future revenue stream and (iii) lessen the impact of unforeseen market swings on our sales revenues. To comply with these objectives we, from time to time, enter into commodities prices derivatives, interest rate derivatives, exchange rate derivatives and other instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposure to market risk. Copper hedges: In 2011, we entered into copper swaps and zero cost collar derivative contracts to reduce price volatility and to protect our sales value as shown below. These transactions meet the requirements of hedge accounting. The realized gains and losses from these derivatives were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings and included in operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. At December 31, 2012 we did not hold any copper hedge positions. Short-term investments: Short-term investments were as follows ($ in millions): At December 31, 2012 2011 Trading securities $ 127.8 $ 514.6 Weighted average interest rate 1.87 % 1.37 % Available—for- sale $ 6.5 $ 7.3 Weighted average interest rate 0.43 % 0.58 % Total $ 134.3 $ 521.9 Trading securities consist of bonds issued by public companies and publicly traded. Each financial instrument is independent of the others. We have the intention to sell these bonds in the short-term. Available-for-sale investments consist of securities issued by public companies. Each security is independent of the others and, as of December 31, 2012, included corporate bonds and asset and mortgage backed obligations. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material. Related to these investments we earned interest, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, we redeemed some of these securities and recognized gains (losses) due to changes in fair value, which were recorded as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings. The following table summarizes the activity of these investments by category (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 Trading: Interest earned $ 3.1 $ 6.0 Unrealized gain (loss) at December 31, $ 2.4 $ (7.6 ) Available-for-sale: Interest earned $ 0.1 $ 0.1 Investment redeemed $ 1.9 $ 2.1 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, contractual maturities of our available-for-sale debt securities are as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 One year or less $ 0.4 $ 0.5 Maturing after one year through five years — — Maturing after five years through ten years — 0.6 Due after 10 years 6.1 6.2 Total debt securities $ 6.5 $ 7.3 98 Table of Contents IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In 2012 the FASB issued the following Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “ASC”). ASU No. 2012-02: On July 27, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” This update simplifies the guidance for testing the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The amendments allow an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment, it is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the organization determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is “more likely than not” that the asset is impaired. This update eliminates the prior requirement to test impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its fair value, an impairment loss was recognized in an amount equal to the difference. The amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt it for future impairment analysis. 99 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:23.561626
1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2014,"Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis — Capital Investment Program. In 2013, a mining consulting group began a study of dump stability at the Toquepala mine. This study will include an assessment of the current stability of the dumps and will develop a geotechnical campaign to obtain information to assess the stability of the future and final stages of the dumps. To increase the possibility of mining in the event of a slide, we have provided for two ramps of extraction for each open-pit mine. While these measures cannot guarantee that a slope failure will not occur, we believe that our mining practices are sound and that the steps taken and the ongoing reviews performed are a prudent methodology for open-pit mining. Mexican operations In 2004, our 15-year mine plan study for the La Caridad mine was awarded to an independent consulting firm to conduct a geotechnical evaluation. The purpose of the plan was to develop a program of optimum bench design and inter-ramp slope angles for the open-pit. A number of recommendations and observations were presented by the consultants. These included a recommendation of a maximum average bench face angle of 72 degrees. Additionally, single benching was recommended for the upper sections of the west, south and east walls of the main pit. Likewise, double benching was recommended for the lower levels of the main pit and single benching for the upper slope segments that consist of either alluvial material, mine waste dumps or mineralized stockpile material. Alternatively, slopes in these types of materials, may be designed with an overall 37 degree slope. The geostructural and geotechnical parameters recommended were applied in the pit design for the new life of the mine plan for La Caridad mine prepared in 2010. This mine plan replaced the 15-year mine plan prepared in 2004. However, since final pit limits have not been yet established at La Caridad, all current pit walls are effectively working slopes. Geostructural and geotechnical data collected at the open-pit mine from cell-mapping and oriented-core drilling databases provided the basis for the geotechnical evaluation and recommendations. We continue to collect new information related to geotechnical data and other geology features in order to ensure the structural security and also to improve the geotechnical data base for future studies At the Buenavista mine, we are following the recommendations of a geotechnical evaluation of design slope for the 15-year pit plan. This evaluation was prepared by an independent mine consulting firm. This evaluation included the determination of optimum pit slope design angles and bench design parameters for the proposed mine plan. The objective of the study was: 1) to determine optimum inter-ramp slope angles and bench design parameters for the 15-year plan and 2) to identify and analyze any potential major instability that could adversely impact mine operation. In 2012, we installed a radar system to monitor the walls of the mine. The following recommendations were made for the Buenavista mine: inter-ramp slope design angles for the 15-year pit plan, for all of the 21 design sectors, defined on a rock-fabric-based catch bench analysis, using double bench, can range from 48° and 55°, and the inter-ramp slope angles are based on geometries that resulted from the back-break analysis using 80% reliability of achieving the required 7.5 meter catch bench width for a single bench configuration and 10.6 meter catch bench width for a double bench configuration. Preliminary observations suggest the 15-year pit walls may be relative free-draining, the back-break analysis assumed depressurized conditions of mine benches, and the inter-ramp stability analysis were performed for both, saturated and depressurized conditions. A pit dewatering/depressurization plan for the Buenavista mine was also recommended to address the issues of open-pit drainage, dewatering plan and future slope depressurization. Phase I of the geohydrological study was completed by an independent consultant. The analysis included a preliminary assessment and work plan implementations. 33 Table of Contents In 2011, five wells for extraction and monitoring were drilled close to the mine. Also, we began a drilling program to monitor possible water filtration beyond the limits of the open-pit mine. All the information obtained from these well drilling programs has been analyzed and included in the hydrologic model. The open-pit dewatering program from the bottom benches also continued during 2012 with a drilling program of 3,797 meters in several monitoring wells in order to allow us to continue with the current mining plan. In 2013, Buenavista continued the executive drilling program of monitoring and extraction wells in the area of Increment (Phase) 5 of the mine and beyond the current limits of the open pit mine. During 2013, the program to dewater the Buenavista pit bottom was continued in accordance with the short and medium term mine plans. Pumping from sumps located in Increment 5, permitted mining of high grade copper blocks. Concurrent with this operational task, a geophysical study was conducted to determine the best locations for water extraction wells to control the inflow of water to the pit bottom and thus allow us to continue our mining operations. The water extracted is being used for various purposes, including road irrigation for dust mitigation. The geophysical investigation also permitted the location of underground workings and the filtration and seepage through fractures. A total of 7,339 meters were drilled during 2013 for 30 extraction wells, three of these wells are located in the area of Increment (Phase) 5. The rest were drilled at various locations outside of the current open pit mine limit. Various studies are now being conducted by outside specialized consultants in order to establish long-range mine water management objectives and to implement recommendations for the efficient use of this resource. 34 Table of Contents METAL PRODUCTION BY SEGMENTS Set forth below are descriptions of the operations and other information relating to the operations included in each of our three segments.

The deposit is part of a mineral district that contains two additional known deposits, Toquepala and Quellaveco. The copper mineralization at Cuajone is typical of porphyry copper deposits. The Cuajone deposit is located approximately 28 kilometers from the Toquepala deposit and is part of the Toquepala Group dated 60 to 100 million years (Upper Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary). The Cuajone lithology includes volcanic rocks from Cretaceous to Quaternary. There are 32 rock types including, pre-mineral rocks, basaltic andesite, porphyritic rhyolite, Toquepala dolerite and intrusive rocks, including diorite, porphyritic latite, breccias and dikes. In addition, the following post-mineral rocks are present, the Huaylillas formation which appears in the south-southeast side of the deposit and has been formed by conglomerates, tuffs, traquites and agglomerates. These formations date 17 to 23 million years and are found in the Toquepala Group as discordance. The Chuntacala formation which dates 9 to 14 million years and is formed by conglomerates, flows, tuffs and agglomerates placed gradually in some cases and in discordance in others. Also Quaternary deposits are found in the rivers, creeks and hills. The mineralogy is simple with regular grade distribution and vertically funnel-shaped. Ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcosine (Cu2S) and molybdenite (MoS2) with occasional galena, tetraedrite and enargite as non economical ore. Mine exploration Exploration activities during the drill campaign in 2013 are as follows: Studies Meters Holes Notes Infill drilling 2,350 13 To obtain additional information to improve confidence in our block model. Condemnatory holes 1,796 3 Areas for dumps. Geotechnical holes 3,502 56 To improve geotechnical information Total 7,648 72 Concentrator Our Cuajone operations use state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems at the concentrator, the crushing plant and the flotation circuit in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. Material with a copper grade over 0.35% is loaded onto rail cars and sent to the milling circuit, where giant rotating crushers reduce the size of the rocks to approximately one-half of an inch. The ore is then sent to the ball mills, which grind it to the consistency of fine powder. The finely ground powder is agitated in a water and reagents solution and is then transported to flotation cells. Air is pumped into the cells to produce foam for floating the copper and molybdenum minerals, but separating waste material called tailings. This copper-molybdenum bulk concentrate is then treated by inverse flotation where molybdenum is floated and copper is depressed. The copper concentrate is shipped by rail to the smelter at Ilo and the molybdenum concentrate is packaged for shipment to customers. Sulfides under 0.35% copper are considered waste. Tailings are sent to thickeners where water is recovered. The remaining tailings are sent to the Quebrada Honda dam, our principal tailings storage facility. Major Cuajone concentrator plant equipment includes: · One primary crusher, · three secondary crushers, · seven tertiary crushers, · one high pressure grinding roller, · eleven primary ball mills, · four ball mills for re-grinding rougher concentrate, · one vertical mill for re-grinding rougher concentrate, · thirty 100-cubic feet cells for rougher flotation, · four 160-cubic feet cells for rougher flotation, · five 60-cubic feet cells for cleaner scavenger, · six 1,350-cubic feet cells for cleaner scavenger, · fourteen 300-cubic feet cells for cleaner scavenger, 37 Table of Contents · eight column cells, · one Larox filter press, · one FLS Smith filter press, · two thickeners for copper-molybdenum and copper concentrates, · three tailings thickeners, · one high-rate tailings thickener, and · six pumps for recycling reclaimed water.

We believe the plant’s equipment is in good physical condition and suitable for our operations. Toquepala Our Toquepala operations consist of an open-pit copper mine and a concentrator. We also refine copper at the SX-EW facility through a leaching process. Toquepala is located in southern Peru, 30 kilometers from Cuajone and 870 kilometers from Lima. Access is by plane from Lima to the city of Tacna (1:40 hours) and then by the Pan-American highway to Camiara (1:20 hours) and by road to Toquepala (1 hour). The concentrator has a milling capacity of 60,000 tons per day. The SX-EW facility has a production capacity of 56,000 tons per year of LME grade A copper cathodes. Overburden removal commenced in 1957 and ore production commenced in 1960.

Geology The Toquepala porphyry copper deposit is located on the western slopes of Cordillera Occidental, in the southern-most Andes Mountains of Peru. The deposit is part of a mineral district that contains two additional known deposits, Cuajone and Quellaveco. The Toquepala deposit is in the southern region of Peru, located on the western slope of the Andes mountain range, approximately 120 kilometers from the border with Chile. This region extends into Chile and is home to many of the world’s most significant known copper deposits. The deposit is in a territory with intrusive and eruptive activities of rhyolitic and andesitic rocks which are 70 million years old (Cretaceous-Tertiary) and which created a series of volcanic lava. The lava is composed of rhyolites, andesites and volcanic agglomerates with a western dip and at an altitude of 1,500 meters. These series are known as the Toquepala Group. Subsequently, different intrusive activities occurred which broke and smelted the rocks of the Toquepala Group. These intrusive activities resulted in diorites, granodiorites and dikes of porphyric dacite. Toquepala has a simple mineralogy with regular copper grade distribution. Economic ore is found as disseminated sulfurs throughout the deposit as veinlets, replenishing empty places or as small aggregates. Ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcosine (Cu2S) and molybdenite (MoS2). A secondary enrichment zone is also found with thicknesses between 0 and 150 meters. Mine Exploration Exploration activities during the drill campaign in 2013 are as follows: Studies Meters Holes Notes Leach and ore confirmation for phase 4 and 5 3,800 8 To confirm the lateral continuity of the ore body. Study of slopes stability 20,000 39 Upgrade of the geotechnical studies of the pit. Instability-west ramp 366 3 To define the potential depth of instability. Total 24,166 50 Concentrator Our Toquepala concentrator operations use state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. Material with a copper grade over 0.40% is loaded onto rail cars and sent to the crushing circuit, where rotating crushers reduce the size of the rocks by approximately 85%, to less than one-half of an inch. The ore is then sent to the rod and ball mills, which grind it in a mix with water to the consistency of fine powder. The finely ground powder mixed with water is then transported to flotation cells. Air is pumped into the cells producing a froth, which carries the copper mineral to the surface but not the waste rock, or tailings. The bulk concentrate with sufficient molybdenum content is processed to recover molybdenum by inverse flotation. This final copper concentrate with a content of approximately 26.5% of copper is filtered in order to reduce moisture to 8.5% or less. Concentrates are then shipped by rail to the Ilo smelter. Tailings are sent to thickeners where water is recovered. The remaining tailings are sent to the Quebrada Honda dam, our principal tailings storage facility. 39 Table of Contents Major concentrator plant equipment at Toquepala includes: · One primary crusher, · three secondary crushers, · six tertiary crushers, · eight rod mills, · twenty-four ball mills, · one distributed control system, · one expert grinding system, · forty-two collective flotation cells, · fifteen column cells, · seventy-two Agitair 1.13 cubic meter cells, · two Larox pressure filters, · five middling thickeners, · two conventional tailings thickeners, · three high-rate tailings thickeners, · one tripper car, · one track tractor, and · one recycled water pipe line. The expected useful life of the principal equipment is over 20 years due to our equipment maintenance programs. SX-EW Plant The SX-EW facility at Toquepala produces grade A LME electrowon copper cathodes of 99.999% purity from solutions obtained by leaching low-grade ore stored at the Toquepala and Cuajone mines. The leach plant commenced operations in 1995 with a design capacity of 35,629 tons per year of copper cathodes. In 1999, the capacity was expanded to 56,000 tons per year. Copper oxides from Cuajone with a copper grade higher than 0.208%, with an acid solubility index higher than 43% and a cyanide solubility index higher than 25% are leached. In Toquepala, the leach material cutoff grade is 0.132% and therefore material with a total copper grade between 0.132% and 0.40% are leached. Major equipment at the Cuajone crusher plant includes: · One primary jaw crusher, and · one secondary cone crusher with a capacity of 390 tons per hour. In addition, the Toquepala plant equipment includes: · one agglomeration mill, · one front end loader, · one 445E Dresser truck of 120-ton capacity, and · two 830E Komatsu trucks of 240-ton capacity for hauling to the leach dumps. Copper in solution produced at Cuajone is sent to Toquepala through an eight-inch pipe laid alongside the Cuajone-Toquepala railroad track. Major equipment at the Toquepala plant includes: · Five pregnant solution (PLS) ponds, each with its own pumping system to send the solution to the SX-EW plant. · Three lines of SX, each with a nominal capacity of 1,068 cubic meters per hour of pregnant solution and 162 electrowinning cells. Plant and equipment are supported by a maintenance plan and a quality management system to assure good physical condition and high availability. The SX-EW plant management quality system (including leaching operations) has been audited periodically since 2002 by an external audit company, and found to be in compliance with the requirements of the ISO 9001-2008 standard. In 2012, we obtained the certification OHSAS 18001 of our occupational health and safety system and the ISO14001-2004 for our environmental standards at the SX-EW plant. 40 Table of Contents Processing Facilities - Ilo Our Ilo smelter and refinery complex is located in the southern part of Peru, 17 kilometers north of the city of Ilo, 121 kilometers from Toquepala, 147 kilometers from Cuajone, and 1,240 kilometers from the city of Lima. Access is by plane from Lima to Tacna (1:40 hours) and then by highway to the city of Ilo (2:00 hours). Additionally, we maintain a port facility in Ilo, from which we ship our product and receive supplies. Product shipped and supplies received are moved between Toquepala, Cuajone and Ilo on our industrial railroad. Smelter Our Ilo smelter produces copper anodes for the refinery we operate as part of the same facility. Copper produced by the smelter exceeds the refinery’s capacity and the excess is sold to other refineries around the world. In 2007 we completed a major modernization of the smelter. The nominal installed capacity of the smelter is 1,200,000 tons of concentrate per year. Copper concentrates from Toquepala and Cuajone are transported by railroad to the smelter, where they are smelted using an ISASMELT furnace, converters and anode furnaces to produce copper anodes with 99.7% copper. At the smelter, the concentrates are mixed with flux and other material and sent to the ISASMELT furnace producing a mixture of copper matte and slag which is tapped through a taphole to either of two rotary holding furnaces, where these smelted phases will be separated. Copper matte contains approximately 63% copper. Copper matte is then sent to the four Pierce Smith converters, where the material is oxidized in two steps: (1) the iron sulfides in the matte are oxidized with oxygen enriched air and silica is added producing slag that is sent to the slag cleaning furnaces, and (2) the copper contained in the matte sulfides is then oxidized to produce blister copper, containing approximately 99.3% copper. The blister copper is refined in two anode furnaces by oxidation to remove sulfur with compressed air injected into the bath. Finally, the oxygen content of the molten copper is adjusted by reduction with injection of liquefied petroleum gas with steam into the bath. Anodes, containing approximately 99.7% copper are cast in two casting wheels. The smelter also can produce blister copper bars, especially when an anode furnace is in general repair. Major equipment at the Ilo smelter includes: · one Isasmelt furnace, · two rotary holding furnaces, · four Pierce-Smith converters, · two slag cleaning furnaces, · two anodes furnaces, · one casting twin-wheel, · one blister holding furnace, · one casting blister wheel, · one waste heat boiler, · one superheated steam, and · three electrostatic precipitators.

The gas stream from the smelter with 11.34% SO2 is split between two plants: The No. 1 acid plant (single absorption/single contact) and the No. 2 plant (double absorption/double contact). Approximately, 16% of the acid produced is used at our facilities with the balance sold to third parties. We anticipate that our internal usage will be over 80% when the Tia Maria project begins operation. The smelter also has two oxygen plants. Plant No. 1, with 272 tons per day of production capacity and Plant No.2, with 1,045 tons per day of capacity. In addition, the smelter includes: · one seawater intake system, · two desalinization plants to provide water for the process, · one electric substation, and · one centralized control using advanced computer technology. In 2010, the Ilo smelter marine trestle started operation. This facility allows us to offload directly to offshore ships the sulfuric acid produced, avoiding hauling cargo through the city of Ilo. The 500 meter long marine trestle is the last part of the Ilo smelter modernization project. Currently all overseas shipments of sulfuric acid are being made using the marine trestle. Refinery The Ilo refinery consists of an electrolytic plant, a precious metal plant and a number of ancillary installations. The refinery is producing grade A copper cathode of 99.998% purity. The nominal capacity is 280,000 tons per year. Anodic slimes are recovered from the refining process and then sent to the precious metals facility to produce refined silver, refined gold and commercial grade selenium. Anodes are suspended in tanks containing an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and copper sulfate. A low voltage but high amperage electrical current is passed through the anodes, chemical solution and cathodes, in order to dissolve copper which is deposited on initially very thin starting sheets increasing its thickness to produce high grade copper cathodes. During this process, silver, gold and other metals, including palladium, platinum and selenium, along with other impurities, settle on the bottom of the tank in the form of anodic slime. This anodic slime is processed in a precious metal plant where silver, gold and selenium are recovered. The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production and sales information for our Ilo refinery and precious metals plants: Refinery 2013 2012 2011 Cathodes produced (kt) 271.0 215.7 261.0 Average copper grade (%) 99.971 99.998 99.998 Refined silver produced (000 Kg) 100.2 89.6 98.1 Refined gold produced (kg) 238.3 184.2 363.1 Commercial grade selenium produced (tons) 51.5 41.5 53.7 Sales data: Average cathodes sales price ($/lb) 3.37 3.67 3.92 Average silver sales price ($/oz) 24.26 30.76 35.10 Average gold sales price ($/oz) 1,392.49 1,663.91 1,579.97 Key: kt = thousand tons Major equipment at the refinery includes: · one electrolytic plant, with 926 commercial cells, · fifty-two starting sheet cells, · sixteen primary liberator cells, · twenty-four secondary liberator cells, 42 Table of Contents · one anodic slime treatment circuit (includes leaching and centrifugation), and · one electrolytic bleeding-off system by railroad to Toquepala’s leaching plants.

Following is a map indicating the approximate location of, and access to, our Mexican open-pit mine complexes, as well as our processing facilities: 44 Table of Contents Buenavista The Buenavista mining unit operates an open-pit copper mine, a concentrator and two SX-EW plants. It is located 100 air-kilometers northwest of La Caridad and 40 kilometers south of the Arizona U.S. Mexican border. It lies on the outskirts of the city of Cananea. Buenavista is connected by paved highways to the border city of Agua Prieta to the northeast, to the town of Nacozari in the southeast, and to the town of Imuris to the west. Buenavista is also connected by railway to Agua Prieta and Nogales. A municipal airport is located approximately 20 kilometers to the northeast of Buenavista. Except for very brief periods, Buenavista was on strike from July 2007 through June 2010. Restoration of mine and plants started in the third quarter of 2010 and was completed in 2011. SX-EW production was restored to full capacity by the fourth quarter of 2010 and concentrator production reached full capacity in the second quarter of 2011. In 2013, mine operations were affected by flooding problems caused by unusual rains in the area, as a consequence we lost approximately 22,900 tons of copper production. The mine restored full operations by the end of the third quarter of 2013. 45 Table of Contents We have started a major capital investment program at Buenavista, which includes a new SX-EW plant with a planned annual capacity of 120,000 tons of copper, a concentrator expansion with an increase in production capacity of 188,000 tons per year and two molybdenum plants with a combined annual capacity of 4,600 tons. This investment program is underway and we expect to complete it in two phases. We expect to complete the first phase in 2014 and estimate an increase in annual production of 120,000 tons and to complete the second phase in 2015 with an expected further increase in annual copper production of 188,000 tons. With these investments, we expect the total production capacity at Buenavista will reach 488,000 tons of copper by 2015. The concentrator has a nominal milling capacity of 76,700 tons per day. The SX-EW facility has a cathode production capacity of 54,750 tons per year. The Buenavista ore body is considered one of the world’s largest porphyry copper deposits. Buenavista is the oldest continuously operated copper mine in North America, with operations dating back to 1899. High grade ore deposits in the district were mined exclusively using underground methods. The Anaconda Company acquired the property in 1917. In the early 1940s Anaconda started developing the first open-pit in Buenavista. In 1990, through a public auction procedure, Minera Mexico acquired 100% of the Buenavista mining assets for $475 million. Buenavista is currently applying conventional open-pit mining methods to extract copper ore for further processing in the concentrator. Two leach ore crushers and the corresponding belt conveying systems are used to convey the leachable material to the heaps. Likewise, run-off mine leachable ore is hauled by trucks to the leach dumps. The following table shows 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for Buenavista: 2013 2012 2011 Mine annual operating days 365 366 365 Mine: Total ore mined (kt) 25,260 25,763 22,444 Copper grade (%) 0.559 0.632 0.623 Leach material mined (*) (kt) 131,559 66,241 47,399 Leach material grade (%) 0.238 0.275 0.299 Stripping ratio (x) 7.18 4.86 3.38 Total material mined (kt) 206,710 150,871 98,306 Concentrator: Total material milled (kt) 25,277 25,748 21,972 Copper recovery (%) 81.93 82.30 80.44 Copper concentrate (kt) 476.5 511.6 410.0 Copper in concentrate (kt) 115.8 134.0 110.1 Copper concentrate average grade (%) 24.31 26.18 26.86 SX-EW plant Estimated leach recovery (%) 50.11 53.29 53.39 SX-EW cathode production (kt) 66.4 66.1 62.3 Key: kt = thousand tons x = Stripping ratio obtained dividing waste plus leachable material by ore mined. The copper grade is total grade. (*) The 2013 increase in leach material mined was due to the additional material mined for the new SX-EW III plant that is expected to start operations in the second quarter of 2014. Major Buenavista mine equipment includes: · Fifty six 400-ton-capacity trucks, · thirteen 320-ton-capacity trucks, · twenty 240-ton-capacity trucks, · three 52,000 gallon-capacity tanker trucks, · four 40,000- gallon-capacity tanker trucks, · four 40-cubic-yard-capacity shovels, · one 56-cubic-yard-capacity shovel, · two 70-cubic-yard-capacity shovels, and · seven 74-cubic-yard-capacity shovels. 46 Table of Contents Mine auxiliary equipment including: · Eleven drillers, · three front loaders, · five motor graders, and · twenty-nine tractors. Geology The Buenavista mining district lies on the southern cordilleran orogen, which extends from southern Mexico to northwestern United States. It also falls within the Basin and Range metallogenic province. Geological and structural features in the district are representative of large, disseminated type, porphyry copper deposits. A calcareous sedimentary sequence of lower Paleozoic age, lithologically correlated with a similar section in southeastern Arizona, uncomformably overlies Precambrian granite basement. The entire section was covered by volcanic rocks of Mesozoic age and later intruded by deep seated granodiorite batholith of Tertiary age, with further quartz monzonite porphyry differentiates of Laramide age. Mineralization in the district is extensive covering a surface area of approximately 30 square kilometers. An early pegmatitic stage associated with bornite-chalcopyrite-molybdenite assemblage was followed by a widespread flooding of hydrothermal solutions with quartz- pyrite-chalcopyrite. A pervasive quartz-sericite alteration is evident throughout the district’s igneous rock fabric. An extensive and economically important zone of supergene enrichment, with disseminated and stockworks of chalcocite (Cu2S), developed below the iron oxide capping. This zone coincides with the topography and has an average thickness of 300 meters. A mixed zone of secondary and primary sulfides underlay the chalcocite blanket. The hypogene mineralization, principally chalcopyrite, (CuFeS2), extensively underlies the ore body. Molybdenite occurs throughout the deposit and the content tends to increase with depth. The Buenavista copper porphyry is considered world-class and unique. The deepest exploration results in the core of the deposit have confirmed significant increase in copper grades. Similar porphyry copper deposits usually contain lower grades at depth. The district is also unique for the occurrence of high-grade breccia pipes, occurring in clusters following the trend of the district. Current dimensions of the mineralized ore body are 5x3 kilometers, and projects to more than 1 kilometer at depth. Considering the geological and economic potential of the Buenavista porphyry copper deposit, it is expected that the operation can support a sizeable increase in copper production capacity. Mine Exploration In-fill core drilling was conducted at the Buenavista zinc-copper-silver deposit, including directional drilling for geotechnical purposes. A deep drilling campaign was initiated in 2011 to explore the extent of the deposit at depth, drilling a total of 3,860 meters in 2012. For short-term mine planning, 6,652 meters were drilled to confirm copper grade and metallurgical recoveries. Also, in 2011, a condemnation drilling program was initiated to define areas for future infrastructure, as well as areas where leach and waste dumps will be deposited. A total of 28,369 meters of core drilling were completed in 2011. A geohydrology program was initiated in 2011 to explore the possibility of groundwater sources within the mine limits, and a total of 29,750 meters of diamond drilling were drilled in 2012. In addition, 3,797 meters were drilled for water monitoring wells. We did not have a drilling campaign in 2013. For 2014, 20,000 meters of drilling are planned to define reserves and to confirm copper and molybdenum grades. Concentrator Buenavista uses state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems at the concentrator, the crushing plant and the flotation circuit in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. Material with a copper grade over 0.38% is loaded onto trucks and sent to the milling circuit, where giant rotating crushers reduce the size of the ore to approximately one-half of an inch. The ore is then sent to the ball and bar mills, which grind it to the consistency of fine powder. The finely ground powder is agitated in a water and reagents solution and is then transported to flotation cells. Air is pumped into the cells producing a froth, which carries the copper mineral to the surface but not the waste rock, or tailings. Recovered copper, with the 47 Table of Contents consistency of froth, is filtered and dried to produce copper concentrates with an average copper content of approximately 27%. Concentrates are then shipped by rail to the smelter at La Caridad. The Buenavista concentrator plant, with a milling capacity of 76,700 tons per day, consists of: · Two primary crushers, · four secondary crushers, · ten tertiary crushers, · ten primary mills, · one expert control system, · five mills for re-grinding, · 103 primary flotation cells, · ten column cells, · seventy scavenger flotation cells, · seven thickeners, and · three ceramic filters. In addition, the facility has: · Forty eight wells and two pumping stations for fresh water supply, · one tailings dam, and · one reclaimed water pumping station. As part of the expansion program for this unit, in 2013 we completed the construction of the first molybdenum plant with an annual production capacity of 2,000 tons of molybdenum contained in concentrate. The plant was designed to process 1,500 tons of copper-molybdenum concentrates per day with a recovery of 85% and 50% of molybdenum content. The molybdenum plant consists of thickeners, homogenizer tanks, flotation cells, column cells and a holo-flite dryer. SX-EW Plant The Buenavista unit operates a leaching facility and two SX-EW plants. All copper ore with a grade lower than the mill cut-off grade of 0.38%, but higher than 0.25%, is delivered to the leach dumps. A cycle of leaching and resting occurs for approximately five years in the run-of-mine dumps and three years for the crushed leach material. The Buenavista unit currently maintains 18.1 million cubic meters of pregnant leach solution in inventory with a concentration of approximately 1.82 grams of copper per liter. Major equipment at the SX-EW I and II plants includes: two crushing systems (No.1 and No.2). Crushing system No. 1 has a capacity of 32,000 tons per day and includes: · One apron feeder, · one conveyor belt feeder, · eight conveyor belt systems, and · one distributing bar. Crushing system No. 2 has a capacity of 48,000 tons per day and includes: · One crusher, · one conveyor belt feeder, · four conveyor belts, and · one distributing bar. There are three irrigation systems for the dumps and eleven dams for the pregnant leach solution (PLS). Plant I has four solvent extraction tanks with a nominal capacity of 16,000 liters per minute of PLS and 52 electrowinning cells and has a daily production capacity of 30 tons of copper cathodes with 99.999% purity. Plant II has five trains of solvent extraction with a nominal capacity of 55,000 liters per minute of PLS and 216 cells distributed in two bays and has a daily production capacity of 120 tons of copper cathodes with 99.9% purity. 48 Table of Contents In 2014, we expect to increase the Buenavista unit’s production of copper cathodes with a new SX-EW plant, (SX-EW III) with an annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The plant would produce copper cathodes of ASTM grade 1 or LME grade A. Please see “Capital Investment Program” under Item 7 for further information. La Caridad The La Caridad complex includes an open-pit mine, concentrator, smelter, copper refinery, precious metals refinery, rod plant, SX-EW plant, lime plant and two sulfuric acid plants. La Caridad mine and mill are located about 23 kilometers southeast of the town of Nacozari in northeastern Sonora. Nacozari is about 264 kilometers northeast of the Sonora state capital of Hermosillo and 121 kilometers south of the U.S.-Mexico border. Nacozari is connected by paved highway with Hermosillo and Agua Prieta and by rail with the international port of Guaymas, and the Mexican and United States rail systems. An airstrip with a reported runway length of 2,500 meters is located 36 kilometers north of Nacozari, less than one kilometer away from the La Caridad copper smelter and refinery. The smelter and the sulfuric acid plants, as well as the refineries and rod plant, are located approximately 24 kilometers from the mine. Access is by paved highway and by railroad. The concentrator began operations in 1979, the molybdenum plant was added in 1982, the smelter in 1986, the first sulfuric acid plant in 1988, the SX-EW plant in 1995, the second sulfuric acid plant in 1997, the copper refinery in 1997, the rod plant in 1998, the precious metals refinery in 1999, and the dust and effluents plant in 2012.

Geology The La Caridad deposit is a typical porphyry copper and molybdenum deposit as seen also in the southwestern basin of United States. The La Caridad mine uses a conventional open-pit mining method. The ore body is at the top of a mountain, which gives La Caridad the advantage of a relative low waste-stripping ratio, natural pit drainage and relative short haul for both ore and waste. The mining method involves drilling, blasting, loading and haulage of ore mill and waste to the primary crushers and the leach materials and waste to dumps, respectively. La Caridad deposit is located in northeastern Sonora, Mexico. The deposit is situated near the crest of the Sierra Juriquipa, about 23 kilometers southeast of the town of Nacozari, Sonora, Mexico. The Sierra Juriquipa rises to elevations of around 2,000 meters in the vicinity of La Caridad and is one of the many north-trending mountain ranges in Sonora that form a southern extension of the basin and range province. The La Caridad porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit occurs exclusively in felsic to intermediate intrusive igneous rocks and associated breccias. Host rocks include diorite and granodiorite. These rocks are intruded by a quartz monzonite porphyry stock and by numerous breccia masses, which contain fragments of all the older rock types. Supergene enrichment, consisting of completes to partial chalcosite (Cu2S) replacement of chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). The zone of supergene enrichment occurs as a flat and tabular blanket with an average diameter of 1,700 meters and thickness generally between 0 and 90 meters. Economic ore is found as disseminated sulfurs within the central part of the deposit. Sulfide-filled breccia cavities are most abundant in the intrusive breccia. This breccia-cavity mineralization occurs as sulfide aggregates which have crystallized in the spaces separating breccia clasts. Near the margins of the deposit, mineralization occurs almost exclusively in veinlets. Ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcosite (Cu2S) and molybdenite (MoS2). Mine Exploration The La Caridad ore body has been mined for over 30 years. The extent of the model area is approximately 6,000 meters by 4,000 meters with elevation ranging from 750 to 1,800 meters. Sixteen drilling campaigns have been conducted on the property since 1968. These campaigns drilled a total of 3,317 drill holes: 1,154 were diamond drill holes and 2,163 were reverse circulation. We have also drilled some hammer and percussion drill holes. A total of 634,080 meters have been drilled through December 2011. In 2008, La Caridad finished a large exploration program of 50,000 meters. The target was to reach to the 900 level in order to reduce the drilling space and to define the copper and molybdenum mineralization continuity and also carry out metallurgical testing for the flotation and leaching processes. There was no exploration program between 2009 and 2011. In 2012, we drilled 10,000 meters and further defined the extent of the copper and molybdenum mineralization. There was no exploration program in 2013. For 2014, we plan a 5,000 meter drilling program to define a high grade ore body located in the south western edge of the pit. Concentrator La Caridad uses state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems at the concentrator, the crushing plant and the flotation circuit in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. The concentrator has a current capacity of 91,000 tons of ore per day. Ore extracted from the mine with a copper grade over 0.30% is sent to the concentrator and is processed into copper concentrates and molybdenum concentrates. The copper concentrates are sent to the smelter and the molybdenum 50 Table of Contents concentrate is sold to a Mexican customer. The molybdenum recovery plant has a capacity of 2,000 tons per day of copper-molybdenum concentrates. The lime plant has a capacity of 340 tons of finished product per day. La Caridad concentrator plant equipment includes: · Two primary crushers, · six secondary crushers, · twelve tertiary crushers, · twelve ball mills, · one master milling control system, · 140 primary flotation cells, · four re-grinding mills, · ninety-six cleaning flotation cells, · twelve thickeners, and · eight drum filters. SX-EW Plant Approximately 693.7 million tons of leaching ore with an average grade of approximately 0.246% copper have been extracted from the La Caridad open-pit mine and deposited in leaching dumps from May 1995 to December 31, 2013. All copper ore with a grade lower than the mill cut-off grade 0.30%, but higher than 0.15% copper, is delivered to the leaching dumps. In 1995, we completed the construction of a SX-EW facility at La Caridad that has allowed processing of this ore and certain leach ore reserves that were not mined and has resulted in a reduction in our copper production costs. The SX-EW facility has an annual capacity of 21,900 tons of copper cathodes. The La Caridad SX-EW plant has: · Nine irrigation systems for the dumps, · two PLS dams, and · one container of heads that permits the combination of the solutions of both dams and which feeds the SX-EW plant with a more homogenous concentration. The plant has three trains of solvent extraction with a nominal capacity of 2,400 cubic meters per hour and 94 electrowinning cells distributed in one single electrolytic bay. The plant has a daily production capacity of 62 tons of copper cathodes with 99.999% purity. Processing Facilities — La Caridad Our La Caridad complex includes a smelter, an electrolytic copper refinery, a precious metal refinery and a copper rod plant. The distance between this complex and the La Caridad mine is approximately 24 kilometers. Smelter Copper concentrates from Buenavista, Santa Barbara, Charcas and La Caridad are transported by rail and truck to the La Caridad smelter where they are processed and cast into copper anodes of 99.2% purity. Sulfur dioxide off-gases collected from the flash furnace, the El Teniente converter and conventional converters are processed into sulfuric acid, at two sulfuric acid plants. Approximately 2% to 3% of this acid is used by our SX-EW plants and the balance is sold to third parties. Almost all of the anodes produced in the smelter are sent to the La Caridad copper refinery. The actual installed capacity of the smelter is 1,000,000 tons per year, a capacity that is sufficient to treat all the concentrates of La Caridad and Buenavista, and starting in 2010, the concentrates from the IMMSA mines, as we closed the San Luis Potosi smelter. Major equipment at the smelter includes: · One flash type concentrates drier, · one steam drier, · one flash furnace, 51 Table of Contents · one El Teniente modified converter furnace, · two electric slag-cleaning furnaces, · three Pierce-Smith converters, · three raffinate furnaces, and · two casting wheels. The anode production capacity is 300,000 tons per year. Refinery La Caridad includes an electrolytic copper refinery that uses permanent cathode technology. The installed capacity of the refinery is 300,000 tons per year. The refinery consists of an anode plant with a preparation area, an electrolytic plant with an electrolytic cell house with 1,115 cells and 32 liberator cells, two cathode stripping machines, an anode washing machine, a slime treatment plant and a number of ancillary installations. The refinery is producing grade A copper cathode of 99.99% purity. Anodic slimes are recovered from the refining process and sent to the slimes treatment plant where additional copper is extracted. The slimes are then filtered, packed and shipped to the La Caridad precious metals refinery to produce silver and gold. The operations of the precious metal refinery begin with the reception of slime from silver concentrates, which are dried in a steam dryer. After this, the dried slime is smelted and a gold and silver alloy is obtained, which is known as Dore. The precious metal refinery plant has a hydrometallurgical stage and a pyrometallurgical stage, besides a steam dryer, Dore casting system, Kaldo furnace, 20 electrolytic cells in the silver refinery, one induction furnace for fine silver, one silver ingot casting system and two reactors for obtaining fine gold. The process ends with the refining of the gold and silver alloy. We also recover commercial selenium from the gas produced by the Kaldo furnace process. Copper Rod Plant A rod plant at the La Caridad complex was completed in 1998 and reached its full annual operating capacity of 150,000 tons in 1999. The plant is producing eight millimeter copper rods with a purity of 99.99%. The rod plant equipment includes: · One vertical furnace, · one retention furnace, · one molding machine, · one laminating machine, · one coiling machine, and · one coil compacter. Other facilities include: · One lime plant with a capacity of 132,000 tons per year, · one sulfuric acid plant with a capacity of 2,625 tons per day, · one sulfuric acid plant with a capacity of 2,135 tons per day, · three oxygen plants, each with a production capacity of 275 tons per day, · one power turbo generator with a 11.5 megawatt capacity, and · one power turbo generator with a 25 megawatt capacity. One of the turbo generators uses residual heat from the flash furnace. In 2012, we started operating a dust and effluent plant with a treatment capacity of 3,100 tons per year which will produce 720 tons of copper by-products and 11,000 tons of lead per year. This plant is designed to reduce dust emissions from La Caridad metallurgical complex. 52 Table of Contents The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for the La Caridad processing facilities: 2013 2012 2011 Smelter Total copper concentrate smelted (kt) 722.6 904.3 832.3 Anode copper production (kt) 222.1 263.0 233.8 Average copper content in anode (%) 99.42 99.22 99.09 Average smelter recovery (%) 98.8 97.4 97.0 Sulfuric acid production (kt) 719.5 887.8 819.0 Refinery Refined cathode production (kt) 188.0 213.7 186.9 Refined silver production (000 kg) 290.6 268.2 215.0 Refined gold production (Kg) 1,269.0 1,426.7 996.1 Rod Plant Copper rod production (kt) 126.8 120.8 107.9 Sales data: Average realized price copper rod ($ per lb) 3.45 3.72 3.98 Average premium copper rod ($ per lb) 0.11 0.12 0.11 Average realized price gold ($ per ounce) 1,430.85 1,666.66 1,584.71 Average realized price silver ($ per ounce) 23.93 31.17 34.94 Average realized price sulfuric acid ($ per ton) 79.55 105.40 90.60 Key: kt = thousand tons Kg = kilograms MEXICAN IMMSA UNIT Our IMMSA unit (underground mining poly-metallic division) operates five underground mining complexes situated in central and northern Mexico and produces zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, and has a coal mine. These complexes include industrial processing facilities for zinc, lead, copper and silver. All of IMMSA’s mining facilities employ exploitation systems and conventional equipment. We believe that all the plants and equipment are in satisfactory operating condition. IMMSA’s principal mining facilities include Charcas, Santa Barbara, San Martin, Santa Eulalia and Taxco.

Charcas is connected to the state capital by a paved highway of 130 kilometers. 14 kilometers from the southeast of the Charcas complex is the “Los Charcos” railroad station which connects with the Mexico-Laredo railway. Also, a paved road connects Charcas to the city of Matehuala via a federal highway and begins at the northeast of the Charcas townsite. The complex includes three underground mines (San Bartolo, Rey-Reina and La Aurora) and one flotation plant that produces zinc, lead and copper concentrates, with significant amounts of silver. The Charcas mining district was discovered in 1573 and operations in the 20th century began in 1911. The Charcas mine is characterized by low operating costs and good quality ores and is situated near the zinc refinery. The Charcas mine is now Mexico’s largest producer of zinc. The Charcas complex’s equipment includes: · Twenty one jumbo drilling tools, · twenty scoop trams for mucking and loading, · thirteen trucks, · two locomotives for internal ore haulage, and · three hoists. In addition, the mill has: · One primary crusher, · one secondary crusher, · two tertiary crushers, · four mills, and · three flotation circuits. Geology The Charcas mining district occupies the east-central part of the Mexican Central Mesa and is part of the Sierra Madre metallogenic province. Geological history starts in the Superior Triasic, where sandy clay sediments were deposited argilloarenaceous. Due to emersion in the beginning of the Jurassic Superior, the sediments suffered intense erosion, settling on continental sediments. This sequence was affected by tectonic effort, which folded and failed on this rock package. Later the positioning of intrusive rocks originated fractures, which gave way to positioning of mineral deposits. The site’s paragenesis suggests two stages of mineralization. First minerals are rich in silver, lead and zinc, with abundant calcite and small quantities of quartz chalcopyrite. Second, there is a link of copper and silver, where the characteristic minerals are chalcopyrite, lead ore with silver content, pyrite and scarce sphalerite. Economic ore is found as replacement sulfurs in carbonates host rock. The ore mineralogy is comprised predominantly of calcopyrite (CuFeS2), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS) and silver minerals as diaphorite (Pb2Ag3Sb3S8). Mine exploration In 2013, 29,376 meters of surface diamond drilling were executed and 19,917 meters from underground stations were drilled, which increased our reserves by 978,211 tons. For 2014, we plan a surface program of 30,000 meters to identify additional reserves. The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for our Charcas mine: 2013 2012 2011 Annual operating days 324 319 324 Total material mined and milled (kt) 1,180 1,164 1,124 Zinc average ore grade (%) 4.0 4.4 4.8 Zinc concentrate produced (kt) 83.9 93.2 93.6 Zinc concentrate average grade (%) 54.49 53.89 56.25 Zinc average recovery (%) 96.65 97.50 97.01 Lead average ore grade (%) 0.2 0.3 0.4 Lead concentrate produced (kt) 1.8 3.7 5.4 Lead concentrate average grade (%) 34.61 40.50 50.10 Lead average recovery (%) 33.02 50.30 65.38 Copper average ore grade (%) 0.32 0.27 0.24 Copper concentrate produced (kt) 9.6 4.7 3.7 Copper concentrate average grade (%) 22.47 27.54 29.70 Copper average recovery (%) 56.84 41.57 40.34 54 Table of Contents kt = thousand tons The Charcas mine uses the hydraulic cut-and-fill method and the room-and-pillar mining method with descending benches. The broken ore is hauled to the underground crusher station. The crushed ore is then hoisted to the surface for processing in the flotation plant to produce lead, zinc and copper concentrates. The capacity of the flotation plant is 4,100 tons of ore per day. The lead concentrate produced at Charcas is treated at a third party refinery in Mexico. The zinc concentrates are treated at our San Luis Potosi zinc refinery and the copper concentrates are treated at our La Caridad smelter. Santa Barbara The Santa Barbara mining complex is located approximately 26 kilometers southwest of the city of Hidalgo del Parral in southern Chihuahua, Mexico. The area can be reached via paved road from Hidalgo del Parral, a city on a federal highway. Chihuahua, the state capital is located 250 kilometers north of the Santa Barbara complex. Additionally, El Paso on the Texas border is located 600 kilometers north of Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara includes three main underground mines (San Diego, Segovedad and Tecolotes) and a flotation plant and produces lead, copper and zinc concentrates, with significant amounts of silver. Gold-bearing veins were discovered in the Santa Barbara district as early as 1536. Mining activities in the 20th century began in 1913. The mining operations at Santa Barbara are more diverse and complex than any of the other mines in our Mexican operations, with veins that aggregate approximately 21 kilometers in length. Each of the three underground mines has several shafts and crushers. Due to the variable characteristics of the ore bodies, four types of mining methods are used: shrinkage stoping, long-hole drilled open stoping, cut-and-fill stoping and horizontal bench stoping. The ore, once crushed, is processed in the flotation plant to produce concentrates. The flotation plant has a capacity of 5,700 tons of ore per day. The lead concentrate produced is treated at a third party refinery in Mexico. The copper concentrates are treated at our La Caridad smelter and the zinc concentrates are either treated at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery or exported. The major mine equipment at Santa Barbara includes: · Twenty-four jumbo drilling tools, · one Simba drilling tool, · forty-six scoop trams, · fourteen trucks for internal ore haulage, · eleven locomotives for internal ore haulage, · four locomotives for surface haulage, · seven trucks for external haulage, and · six hoists. The concentrator plant has a milling capacity of 5,800 tons of ore per day and includes the following equipment: · Six primary jaw crushers, · one secondary crusher, · two tertiary crushers, · three mills, and · three flotation circuits. Geology The majority of the production from the district comes from quartz veins within faults and fractures. The north to northwestern trending vein is up to several kilometers long, dips steeply to the west and is 0.5 to 30 meters wide. Ore shoots up to several hundred meters in length, extends to at least 900 meters below the surface and is separated from other ore by 0.5 to 1 meter of barren quartz vein. Metal zoning occurs in some veins, with zinc and lead content generally decreasing with depth and copper increasing with depth. Three main systems of veins exist inside the district, represented 55 Table of Contents by the veins Coyote, Segovedad Novedad and Coyote Seca Palmar. In addition to the main veins, there are many smaller sub-parallels to branching ore bearing veins. Economic ore minerals include sphalerite (ZnS), marmatite (ZnFeS), galena (PbS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and tetrahedrite (CuFe12Sb4S13). Gangue minerals include quartz (SiO2), pyrite (FeS2), magnetite (Fe2O4), pirrotite (Fe2+S), arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and fluorite (CaF2). The Santa Barbara district has mineralization to indicate that it will continue to be a significant producer of lead, copper and zinc for decades. The full potential of the district has not yet been defined, but the area seems to justify an increase in exploration. Mine Exploration: In 2013 we drilled 52,513 meters from the surface and 15,060 meters from underground stations, which increased reserves by 2,076,100 tons. For 2014, 46,000 meters of diamond drilling are planned to identify additional reserves. The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for our Santa Barbara mines: 2013 2012 2011 Annual operating days 301 322 321 Total material mined and milled (kt) 1,595 1,590 1,553 Zinc average ore grade (%) 2.52 2.41 2.33 Zinc concentrate produced (kt) 63.9 60.5 57.7 Zinc concentrate average grade (%) 53.86 54.29 53.85 Zinc average recovery (%) 85.6 85.7 85.9 Lead average ore grade (%) 1.32 1.18 1.07 Lead concentrate produced (kt) 29.5 27.6 24.3 Lead concentrate average grade (%) 60.80 59.64 58.91 Lead average recovery (%) 85.04 87.82 86.20 Copper average ore grade (%) 0.49 0.52 0.51 Copper concentrate produced (kt) 14.4 15.0 14.6 Copper concentrate average grade (%) 29.65 30.39 30.51 Copper average recovery (%) 54.51 55.07 56.13 kt = thousand tons Santa Eulalia The mining district of Santa Eulalia is located in the central part of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, approximately 26 kilometers east of the city of Chihuahua. This district covers approximately 48 square kilometers and is divided into three fields: east field, central field and west field. The west field and the east field, in which the principal mines of the complex are found, are separated by six kilometers. The Buena Tierra mine is located in the west field and the San Antonio mine is located in the east field. The mining district was discovered in 1590, although exploitation did not formally begin until 1870. The district of Santa Eulalia is connected to the city of Chihuahua by a paved road (highway no. 45), at a distance of ten kilometers there is a paved detour to Aquiles Serdan and Francisco Portillo (also known as Santo Domingo) where the Company’s offices and the Buena Tierra mine are located. Access to the Buena Tierra mine and San Antonio mine is via an 11 kilometer unpaved road. In May 2010, the Santa Eulalia mine suspended operations due to a flooding in the area brought on by the failure of a dike caused by excess water pressure. In 2011, the rehabilitation work was interrupted by a second flooding which required us to extend the pumping work. The pumping work was completed in April 2013 allowing us to restore production. The flotation plant, at which lead and zinc concentrates are produced, has a capacity of 1,450 tons of ore per day. The lead concentrate is treated at a third party refinery, and the zinc concentrate is treated at our San Luis Potosi refinery. Major mine equipment at the Santa Eulalia mine includes: 56 Table of Contents · Five Jumbo drilling tools, · eleven scoop trams for mucking and loading, · three trucks, and · three hoists. The concentrator plant has a milling capacity of 1,450 tons of ore per day and includes the following equipment: · Two underground primary crushers, · one secondary crusher, · one tertiary crusher, · two screen, · one mill, and · two flotation circuits. Geology Santa Eulalia is the largest of a number of similar districts that lie along the intersection of the Laramide-aged Mexican Thrust Belt and the Tertiary volcanic plateau of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Deposits throughout the belt occur in a thick Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonate succession that overlies Paleozoic or older crust. The main sedimentary rock in the Santa Eulalia district is the Lower Cretaceous Limestone. These are irregularly covered by volcanic sedimentary conglomerates that are overlaid by volcanic rocks of the tertiary and alluvial material of the Quaternary Age. In the Santa Eulalia mining district a thickness of 500 meters of sedimentary rocks is known to exist which consists of the following formations: 1) Formation Lagrima (limestone fossils); 2) Formation Glen Rose (limestone blue and at its base a black limestone appears); and 3) Formation Cuchillo (limestone with shale). Dikes and sills of rhyolite composition and sills of diabase also exist. In the district there are several systems of fractures and faults associated with the emplacement of felsitic and maphic intrusives. The most important controller of the ore bodies are the north-south fractures. The mineralization corresponds in its majority to ore skarns — silicoaluminates of calcium, iron and manganese with variable quantities of lead, zinc, copper and iron sulfides, located in the planes of crossings in the interstices of the silicates. Economic ore is found as replacement in the Limestone Glen Rose in the contact with dikes and sills and replacements in diabase sills. The mineralogy is comprised predominantly of sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS) and small quantities of pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3). Mine Exploration In 2013 we drilled 17,440 meters from the surface and 3,666 meters from underground stations, which increased our reserves by 373,140 tons. For 2014, an additional diamond drilling program of 20,000 meters is planned to increase reserves. The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for our Santa Eulalia mine: 2013 2012 2011 Annual operating days 296 257 217 Total material mined and milled (kt) 290.4 154.3 154.3 Zinc average ore grade (%) 7.64 5.95 7.15 Zinc concentrate produced (kt) 37.5 13.3 0.1 Zinc concentrate average grade (%) 51.37 51.46 35.03 Zinc average recovery (%) 86.92 74.63 0.34 Lead average ore grade (%) 2.20 2.08 2.72 Lead concentrate produced (kt) 8.9 4.0 5.0 Lead concentrate average grade (%) 60.99 49.96 35.80 Lead average recovery (%) 84.52 61.47 42.74 kt = thousand tons 57 Table of Contents San Martin San Martin has been on strike since July 2007. Please see Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements. The San Martin mining complex is located in the municipality of Sombrerete in the western part of the state of Zacatecas, Mexico, approximately 101 kilometers southeast of the city of Durango and nine kilometers east of the Durango State boundary. Access to the property is via a federal highway between the cities of Durango and Zacatecas. A paved six kilometer road connects the mine and town of San Martin with the highway. The city of Sombrerete is about 16 kilometers east of the property. The complex includes an underground mine and a flotation plant and produces lead, copper and zinc concentrates, with significant amounts of silver. The mining district in which the San Martin mine is located was discovered in 1555. Mining operations in the 20th century began in 1949. San Martin lies in the Mesa Central between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental. The horizontal cut-and-fill mining method is used at the San Martin mine. The broken ore is hauled to the underground crusher station. The ore is then brought to the surface and fed to the flotation plant to produce concentrates. The flotation plant has a total capacity of 4,400 tons of ore per day. The lead concentrate is treated at a third party refinery in Mexico. The copper concentrate was treated at our San Luis Potosi copper smelter and the zinc concentrate is either treated at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery or exported. The major mine equipment at San Martin includes: · Eight jumbo drilling tools, · thirteen scoop trams, · nine trucks, and · three hoists. The concentrator plant has a mill capacity of 4,400 tons of ore per day and includes the following equipment: · Two primary jaw crushers, · two secondary crushers, · one tertiary crusher, · two mills, and · three flotation circuits. Geology San Martin lies in the Central Mesa between two major geologic provinces, Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental. The main sedimentary rock-formation in the San Martin district is the Upper Cretaceous Age Cuesta del Cura limestone. The formation is an interlayered sequence of shallow marine limestone and black chert, and it is overlain by Indura formation which outcrops at the foot of the topographic heights of the Cuesta del Cura formation. It consists mainly of alternating shales and fine-grained clayed limestones in ten to thirty centimeter thick layers. The district’s most important mineral deposits are replacement veins and bodies generated in the skarn by Cerro de la Gloria granodiorite intrusion. An extensive zone of skarn west of the intrusive hosts, the San Marcial, Ibarra and Gallo-Gallina main ore veins, which appear at the surface for distances of up to 1,000 meters, with thicknesses of 40 centimeters to four meters, paralleling the intrusive contact. In the central part of the deposit there is a horizontal zoning with respect to the contact of the intrusive with high values of silver and copper. In the top of the deposit there is mostly lead and zinc. In the northeast/east over concentric structures to the intrusive there is an increment of lead, zinc and silver in the skarn. Economic ore is found as replacement ore bodies between the main veins as massive and disseminated sulfides with widths from eight meters up to 200 meters. These bodies consist mostly of chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), bornite (Cu5FeS4), tetrahedrite (CuFe12Sb4S13), native silver (Ag), pyrrite (FeS), arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and stibnite (Sb2S3). Molybdenum and tungsten are found in little portions in the skarn near the contact associated with the calcite. Mine Exploration There was no mine exploration drilling in the three years ending December 31, 2013 because the San Martin mine was on strike. 58 Table of Contents There was no production at the San Martin mine in the three years ending December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes the estimated production losses at our San Martin mine due to the strike: 2013 2012 2011 Days of strike 365 366 365 Estimated strike production loss (tons): Zinc in concentrates 10,264 10,264 10,264 Lead in concentrates 500 500 500 Copper in concentrates 4,360 4,360 4,360 Taxco Taxco has been on strike since July 2007. Please see Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements. The Taxco mining complex is located on the outskirts of the city of Taxco in the northern part of the state of Guerrero, Mexico, approximately 71 kilometers from the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos, where access through the highway to the complex is possible. The complex includes several underground mines (San Antonio, Guerrero and Remedios) and a flotation plant and produces lead and zinc concentrates, with some amounts of gold and silver. The mining district in which the Taxco mines are located was discovered in 1519. Mining activities in the 20th century commenced in 1918. The Taxco district lies in the northern part of the Balsas-Mexcala basin adjacent to the Paleozoic Taxco-Zitacuaro Massif. We employ shrinkage, cut-and-fill and the room and pillar mining methods at the Taxco mines. The flotation plant has a capacity of 2,000 tons of ore per day. The lead concentrate is treated at a third party refinery in Mexico. The zinc concentrate is either treated at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery or exported. The major mine equipment at the Taxco complex includes: · Four Jumbo drilling tools, · ten scoop trams for mucking and loading, · five trucks for internal ore haulage, · three locomotives for internal ore haulage, and · three hoists. The concentrator plant has a milling capacity of 2,000 tons of ore per day and includes the following equipment · Two primary crushers, · one secondary crusher, · two tertiary crushers, · three mills, and · two flotation circuits. Geology The Taxco district is stratigraphically formed of rocks from Jurassic to recent periods, which are described below, with emphasis on the mineralization control characteristics. The Taxco schist is composed of a series of schists and fylites, most likely from a volcanic-sedimentary sequence of tufa and limonites. They represent a sequence of metamorphological arch and its age has been defined as Jurassic Medium. The Morelos formation from the Upper Cretaceous age (Apian-Turonian) lies on a discordant form over Taxco schist and its contact is several times marked by a clay zone (mylonites) and breccia, which implies a shifting of this unit over the schist (packs). The Mezcala formation is constituted by a sequence of shale and sandstone with some inter-stratified layers of limestone. Its base is calcarean. Its top tends to be rich in clay with thin limestone layers. The Balsas group is constituted by conglomerates and is sandy on its base, rests in discordance form on an erosioned surface from the Mexcala formation. The Tilzapotla Rhyolite is the newest rock, which emerged in the district before the alluvial deposit. It is formed of flux, breccia, tuffaceous, ignimbrites and vitrophyrre of rhyolite composition. 59 Table of Contents There are four types of ore deposits found in Taxco district. In order of importance they are as follows: fissure-filling veins, replacement veins, blanket-like replacement bodies (so called “mantos”), stock works and brecciate chimneys. The three first ones are intimately related and they were formed in the same era, although in different stages. The veins reach up to two kilometers in length with a variable potency of thirty centimeters up to eight meters, which is the case of copper veins at the mines of Guerrero, Hueyapa and Palo Amarillo at the San Antonio mine; the Remedios mine has among other veins, El Muerto and El Cristo one kilometer long and five meters in average potency. Economic ore is found in the deposit in veins. Ore mineral include argentiferous galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3), and other sulfosalts, and replacement “mantos.” The most mineralized zones are in the vicinity of the veins with the limestone. The mineralization is more intensive in the base of the limestone and consists of sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), pyrite (FeS) and magnetite (FeOFe2O3). Mine Exploration There was no mine exploration drilling in the three years ending December 31, 2013 at the Taxco mine was on strike. There was no production at the Taxco mine in the three years ending December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes the estimated production losses at our Taxco mine due to the strike: 2013 2012 2011 Days of strike 365 366 365 Estimated strike production loss (tons): Zinc in concentrates 13,270 13,270 13,270 Lead in concentrates 2,225 2,225 2,225 Processing Facilities - San Luis Potosi Our San Luis Potosi electrolytic zinc refinery is located in the city of San Luis Potosi, in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The San Luis Potosi copper smelter is adjacent to the refinery. The city of San Luis Potosi is connected to our refinery and smelter by a major highway. Smelter Our San Luis copper smelter was closed in 2010, and copper concentrates previously smelted at this plant are now sent to La Caridad for smelting. We have initiated a program for plant demolition and soil remediation with a revised budget of $62.4 million, of which we have spent $35.7 million at December 31, 2013. Plant demolition and construction of a confinement area at the south of the property were completed in 2012 and we expect to complete soil remediation and the construction of a second confinement by the end of 2014. We will deposit metallurgical and other waste material resulting from plant demolition in the confinement areas. We expect that once the site is remediated, we will decide if we will sell the property or promote an urban development to generate a net gain on the disposal of the property. Zinc Refinery The San Luis Potosi electrolytic zinc refinery was built in 1982. It was designed to produce 105,000 tons of refined zinc per year by treating up to 200,000 tons of zinc concentrate from our own mines, principally Charcas, which is located 113 kilometers from the refinery. The refinery produces special high grade zinc (99.995% zinc), high grade zinc (over 99.9% zinc) and zinc-based alloys with aluminum, lead, copper or magnesium in varying quantities and sizes depending on market demand. Refined silver and gold production is obtained from tolling services provided by a third party mining company. The electrolytic zinc refinery’s major equipment includes: · One roaster with 85 square meters of roasting area, · one steam recovery boiler, and · one acid plant. 60 Table of Contents There is a calcine processing area with five leaching stages: neutral, hot acid, intermediate acid, acid, purified fourth and jarosite, as well as two stages for solution purifying. Additionally, the equipment includes: · One cell house with two electrowinning circuits to finally obtain metallic zinc, · one alloy and molding area with two induction furnaces and four molding systems, two of them with chains to produce 25 kilogram ingots, and · two casting wheels to manufacture one ton jumbo pieces. The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for our San Luis Potosi zinc refinery: 2013 2012 2011 Total zinc concentrate treated (kt) 193.7 173.2 174.8 Refined zinc produced (kt) 97.7 93.5 90.9 Sulfuric acid produced (kt) 175.2 159.1 158.0 Refined silver produced (kt) 11.6 15.6 13.7 Refined gold produced (k) 9.0 14.7 14.2 Refined cadmium produced (kt) 0.6 0.6 0.6 Average refinery recovery (%) 94.5 95.4 95.2 Average realized price refined zinc ($ per lb) 92.4 95.0 1.05 Average realized price zinc concentrate ($ per lb) 82.5 — — Average realized price silver ($ per oz) 22.95 31.29 35.08 kt = thousand tons Nueva Rosita Coal and Coke Complex The Nueva Rosita coal and coke complex began operations in 1924 and is located in the state of Coahuila, Mexico on the outskirts of the city of Nueva Rosita near the Texas border. It includes a) an underground coal mine, which has been closed since 2006; b) an open-pit mine with a yearly capacity of approximately 350,000 tons of coal; c) a coal washing plant with a capacity of 900,000 tons per year that produces high quality clean coal; and d) a re-engineered and modernized 21 ovens coke facility capable of producing 100,000 tons of coke per year (metallurgical, nut and fine) of which, 95,000 tons are metallurgical coke. There is also a by-product plant to clean the coke gas oven in which tar, ammonium sulfate and light crude oil are recovered. There are also two boilers, which produce 80,000 pounds of steam that is used in the by-products plant. The re-engineering and modernization of 21 ovens was completed in April 2006. We believe the plant’s equipment is in good physical condition and suitable for our operations. Coke production is sold to Penoles and other Mexican consumers in northern Mexico. We sold 76,831 tons, 69,638 tons and 82,014 tons of metallurgical coke in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect to sell 85,360 tons of metallurgical coke in 2014. Carbon mine exploration In Coahuila, an intensive exploration program of diamond drilling has identified two additional areas, Esperanza with a potential for more than 30 million tons of “in place” mineralized coal and Guayacan with a potential for 15 million tons of “in place” mineralized coal, that could be used for a future coal-fired power plant. In 2010 and 2011, 1,213 and 2,640 meters of diamond drilling, respectively, were completed at the Rosita pit area and as a result, 10,100 tons and 178,000 tons of coal, respectively, were added to the reserves estimates for this open-pit mine. In addition in 2012, 3,793 meters of drilling were completed at the La Conquista, Nueva Rosita and La Lavadora pits. In 2013 we drilled 2,451 meters and increased our coal reserve estimate by 39,552 tons at the La Conquista pit. For 2014, we expect to execute a 600 meter drilling program to increase the reserves in this pit. 61 Table of Contents The table below sets forth 2013, 2012 and 2011 production information for our Nueva Rosita coal and coke complex: 2013 2012 2011 Coal mined — open-pit (kt) 291.5 325.3 238.5 Average BTU content BTU/Lb 9,485 9,000 9,400 Average percent sulfur % 1.87 1.50 1.00 Clean coal produced (kt) 141.3 148.2 103.9 Coke tonnage produced (kt) 93.2 91.2 84.4 Average realized price - Coal ($ per ton) 46.8 38.1 29.8 Average realized price - Arsenic clean coal ($ per ton) 78.33 — 56.14 Average realized price - Coke ($ per ton) 299.58 318.7 292.6 kt = thousand tons ORE RESERVES Ore reserves are those estimated quantities of proven and probable material that may be economically mined and processed for extraction of their mineral content, at the time of the reserve determination. “Proven” (measured) reserves are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed samplings; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established. “Probable” (indicated) reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. “Mineralized material,” on the other hand, is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average grade of metal(s). Such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until legal and economic feasibility are concluded based upon a comprehensive evaluation of unit costs, grade, recoveries and other material factors. Our proven and probable ore reserve estimates are based on engineering evaluations of assay values derived from the sampling of drill holes and other openings. We believe that the samplings taken are spaced at intervals sufficiently close enough and the geological characteristics of the deposits are sufficiently well defined to render the estimates reliable. The ore reserves estimates include assessments of the resource, mining and metallurgy, as well as economic, marketing, legal, environmental, governmental, social and other necessary considerations. Our Peruvian operations, including the Toquepala and Cuajone reserves, are classified into proven (measured), probable (indicated) and possible (inferred) categories based on a RCB Index (Relative Confidence Bound Index) that measures our level of geologic knowledge and confidence in each block. The RCB index is a measure of relative confidence in the block grade estimate. This approach combines the local variability of the composites used to krig a block with the kriging variance and incorporates the use of confidence intervals in measuring uncertainty of the block estimates relative to each other. The final resource classification is then based on the distribution of these RCB values for blocks above 0.05% copper. It is the distribution that is used to find the breaks between proven/probable and probable/possible. Our Mexican operations, including the Buenavista and La Caridad reserves, are calculated using a mathematical block model and applying the MineSight software system. The estimated grades per block are classified as proven and probable. These grades are calculated applying a three-dimensional interpolation procedure and the inverse distance squared. Likewise, the quadrant method or spherical search is implemented in order to limit the number of composites that will affect the block’s interpolated value. The composites data is derived from the geological exploration of the ore body. In order to classify the individual blocks in the model, a thorough geostatistical variogram analysis is conducted, taking into consideration the principal characteristics of the deposit. Based on this block model classification, and with the implementation of the Lerch-Grossman algorithm, and the MineSight Pit Optimizer procedure, mineable reserves are determined. The calculated proven and probable reserves include those blocks that are economically feasible to mine by open-pit method within a particular mine design. 62 Table of Contents For the IMMSA unit, the basis for reserve estimations are sampling of mining operations and drilling exploration, geographical and topographic surveys, tracking down all the foregoing in the corresponding maps, measurement, calculation and interpretation based on the maps and reports from the mines, the mills and/or smelters. Mineral reserves are mineral stock which is estimated for extraction, to exploit if necessary, to sell or utilize economically, all or in part, taking into consideration the quotations, subsidies, costs, availability of treatment plants and other conditions which we estimate will prevail in the period for which reserves are being calculated. The reserves are divided into proven (85% reliable or more according to statistical studies) and probable (70-80% reliable or more according to statistical studies) categories according to their level of reliability and availability. In order to comply with SEC regulations, proven reserves is a classification that can only be used for such mineral found on top of the last level of the mine (either mineral up to 15 meters below the last level or below the first 15 meters only with sufficient drilling (25 or 30 meters between each drill)). Annually our engineering department reviews in detail the reserve computations. In addition, our engineering department reviews the computation when changes in assumptions occur. Changes can occur for price or cost assumptions, results in field drilling or new geotechnical parameters. We also engage third party consultants to review mine planning procedures. Pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserves information in this report are calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years unless otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current prices.” Our current prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current prices for molybdenum are calculated according to Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use $3.65 per pound for copper and $12.74 per pound for molybdenum, both current prices as of December 31, 2013. The current prices for copper and molybdenum were $3.68 and $14.52 as of December 31, 2012 and $3.26 and $13.95 as of December 31, 2011, respectively. For internal ore reserve estimation, our management uses long-term metal price assumptions for copper and molybdenum, of $2.00 per pound of copper and $12.00 per pound of molybdenum to reflect the changes in market trends. These prices continued at December 31, 2013. For other forecast and planning purposes, particularly related to merger and acquisition activities, our management considers various other price scenarios. The use of these other price assumptions does not affect the preparation of our financial statements. For the years 2013, 2012 and 2011, we have used reserves estimates based on current average prices as of the most recent year then ended to determine amortization of mine development and intangible assets. We periodically reevaluate estimates of our ore reserves, which represent our estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in our existing mine locations that can be produced and sold at a profit. These estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples of drill holes and other openings, combined with assumptions about copper market prices and production costs at each of our mines.

The following stages are identified at the Cuajone, Toquepala, Buenavista and La Caridad mines: 1. The mine geologists gather the necessary monthly statistical data from our information system (“SRP”), which provides ore tons milled and ore grades in the concentrator. 2. Mined areas are topographically determined and related boundaries are built. 3. Using the “interactive planner” option in our mining software (MineSight), ore tons and grades are calculated inside mined areas over the block model. At this point the current cut-off grade is considered. 4. In the final stage, accumulated tons mined, weighted average grade for ore material and leach is compared to data coming from our SRP system. Tonnage and grade reconciliation for 2013 are as follows: Long Range Model Mill Variance Mine Tons (thousands) % Copper Tons (thousands) % Copper Tons (thousands) % Copper Cuajone 29,097 0.660 29,269 0.669 (172 ) (0.009 ) Toquepala 20,599 0.567 19,954 0.611 645 (0.044 ) Buenavista 25,233 0.537 25,260 0.559 (27 ) (0.022 ) La Caridad 33,305 0.340 33,570 0.344 (265 ) (0.004 ) If the estimation error appears greater than 3%, a detailed evaluation is done to review the differences, which normally could result in more in-fill drilling, in order to better understand the geological characteristics (grade, rock type, mineralization and alteration) and the spacing of drill holes which are considered in the ore body zone.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” the” Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business” - “Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile and in 2011 we started exploration activities in Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2013, we invested $1,703.3 million in capital programs along with $51 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. Our copper ore reserves, at December 31, 2013, totaled 67.6 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $2.00 per pound (as of December 31, 2013, the LME and COMEX copper price was $3.35 and $3.44, respectively), as follows: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 30,889 Peruvian operations 25,103 IMMSA 220 Development projects 11,388 Total 67,600 Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · Changes in copper and molybdenum prices: In 2013, the average LME copper price was $3.32 per pound and the average COMEX copper price was $3.34 per pound, about 8% and 7.5% lower than in 2012, respectively. Average silver, molybdenum and zinc prices in 2013 decreased, 23.6%, 18.7% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to 2012. In 2013, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.01 to $3.74. · Sales structure: In the last three years approximately 77.3% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 7.1% from molybdenum, 7.1% from silver, 3.1% from zinc and 5.4% from various other products, including sulfuric acid, gold and other materials. 76 Table of Contents · Metal markets: We are cautiously optimistic about the current economic scenario. The International Monetary Fund has consistently increased its 2014 growth forecast for the world economy, expecting a 3.7% increase in global GDP growth for 2014 and 3.9% for 2015. A driver for the world economy is the synchronized growth expected for the United States, Europe and Japan, which together represent about 54% of the world GDP. These three economies consume directly about 31% of the world’s refined copper production and are an important driver of indirect demand. Copper: During 2013, we have seen the strong fundamentals of this market coming back again to support copper prices. As of December 31, 2013, inventories at the three major warehouses (LME, COMEX and Shanghai) have decreased by 427,300 tons or 45% since their peak in June of last year. This decreasing trend has continued during 2014, with inventories of refined copper at January 31, 2014, 6% lower than 2013´s close. We expect that the sustained recovery of the major economies, in conjunction with the year-to-year increase in Chinese copper imports of 6.5%, will reduce the chance of an oversupply, particularly of refined copper, our main product, in 2014. On the supply side, despite some evidence of a possible market oversupply for the coming year, we think that several structural factors, such as labor stoppages, excessive taxation or governmental intervention, technical problems, scrap shortages and other issues are affecting and will continue to affect copper supply, offsetting the net impact of additional production coming from new projects and expansions. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong fundamentals of the copper market. We believe that our aggressive investment program of organic growth, aimed at increasing production from current capacity to approximately 1.2 million tons by 2017 will lead to further benefits in the coming years. Silver: Represented 6.6% of our sales in 2013 and it is with molybdenum our most significant by-product. Silver prices averaged $23.82 per ounce in 2013, 23.6% lower than its 2012 price. We believe that silver prices will have strong support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Molybdenum: Represented 6.6% of our sales in 2013. In last quarter of 2013 we saw stable molybdenum demand. Regarding the supply, we are expecting a 10% worldwide growth coming from our Buenavista operation as well as Sierra Gorda, Toromocho and Caserones, among other projects. Even though the current scenario for molybdenum prices is not positive, it is important to note that about 50% of the supply of this metal comes from primary or dedicated molybdenum mines, which have a cash cost in the range of $9-$12 per pound. This creates a natural barrier for the molybdenum market to adjust production volume and thereby protect low cost secondary molybdenum producers such our Company. Zinc: Represented 3.4% of our sales in 2013. We also believe that zinc has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns. In the last 12 months, zinc inventories have decreased by 30%, improving this markets fundamentals. We are expecting an increasing price scenario for zinc in the next few years. · Production: For 2014, we are expecting to produce 672,400 tons of copper from our mines. We don’t expect to process third party copper concentrates in 2014. As we have reported, we expect that the new SX-EW III plant at Buenavista will start operations during the second quarter of 2014 and produce 53,400 tons during 2014. We expect to produce 21,500 tons of molybdenum in 2014, 7.6% more than our 2013 production and a new Company record. This production forecast includes 1,980 tons from our molybdenum plant at Buenavista. We also expect to produce and sell 16.3 million ounces of silver and produce 95,200 tons of zinc in 2014. · Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three-year period 2011 to 2013 have generally increased in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 77 Table of Contents 2013 2012(*) 2011 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 3,421 $ 3,244 $ 3,193 Percentage increase from prior year 5.5 % 1.6 % (*) Operating costs and expenses for 2012 does not include a one-time expense of $316.2 million, for legal fees related to a shareholder derivative lawsuit. According, operating costs and expenses for 2012 is a non-GAAP measure, please see subheading “Non-GAAP information reconciliation”, for a reconciliation of this to a GAAP measure, in this Item 7. Operating costs and expenses increased in the three-year period due to higher depreciation, caused by the completion and placing in service of some capital assets for both our Buenavista expansion program and our maintenance programs. Cost of sales increases, during the period, were largely caused by the higher cost of fuel, power and labor. The sharp decrease in the purchase and sale of third-party metal concentrates in the 2013 and 2012 years, helped reduce cost of sales. · Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures reached a new record of $1,703.3 million for 2013, 105.2% of net income and 61.9% higher than in 2012. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is in full steam. For 2014, we plan to invest $2.3 billion in capital projects, an increase of $600 million compared to 2013 and 142% of last year’s net income. As we have previously reported, our investment program aims to increase copper production capacity approximately 87% by 2017. · World Finance recognition. In November 2013, World Finance, an international business magazine, recognized our 2012 $1.5 billion fixed-rate senior unsecured notes as the best international debt issue of the year in the mining industry. The notes were issued in two tranches, $300 million due in 2022 at an annual interest rate of 3.5% and $1.2 billion due in 2042 at an annual interest rate of 5.25%. At the time, these interest rates were the lowest obtained by any BBB rated Latin-American debt issue with maturities of 10 and 30 years. · Mexican tax changes; In December 2013, the Mexican Congress enacted tax law changes that became effective on January 1, 2014. Among other things the new law establishes: 1) A 7.5% mining royalty on taxable EBITDA. Assuming a copper price of $3.50 per pound, this royalty charge would have an estimated net after-tax cost of $53 million, in 2014. 2) An additional royalty of 0.5% on the net sales value of gold, silver and platinum. We do not expect this royalty charge to have a significant impact on our results. 3) A change in the method used to determine water rights which will increase water cost by approximately $20 million per year, 4) A new environmental tax on the sale and importation of fossil fuels that would have an annual estimated cost of approximately $6 million. 5) The law eliminates certain benefits of tax consolidation rules, and 6) The law maintains the statutory income tax rate at 30%, thereby eliminating the scheduled reductions for 2014 and 2015. Related to these changes we recognized a deferred income tax charge of $34.7 million. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues, and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. 78 Table of Contents Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Variance 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Net sales $ 5,953 $ 6,669 $ 6,819 $ (716 ) $ (150 ) Operating income 2,532 3,109 3,625 (577 ) (516 ) Net income attributable to SCC $ 1,618 $ 1,935 $ 2,336 $ (317 ) $ (401 ) Earnings per share $ 1.92 $ 2.28 $ 2.73 $ (0.36 ) $ (0.45 ) Dividends per share $ 0.68 $ 4.06 $ 2.43 $ (3.38 ) $ 1.63 Pounds of copper sold 1,382 1,415 1,320 (33 ) 95 Net sales decreased in the three-year period from 2011 to 2013, due to lower metal prices for copper and our principal by-products. Improved sales volumes for some of our products helped reduce the impact of the price decreases. The 2013 molybdenum sales volume increased by 9.4% and includes a new record of 25.9 million pounds at our La Caridad mine and 0.8 million pounds from the first production of the new molybdenum plant at Buenavista. The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, which increased in each of the years in the periods above. Cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by a little over $100 million and $70 million, respectively, in 2013. The increase in cost of sales was due to cost inflation of fuel, explosives, tires and reagents, as well as increases in labor cost, mainly at the Peruvian operations due to the new collective bargaining agreements, signed in early 2013. The increase in depreciation was mainly due to the start-up of the Quebalix III and the first molybdenum plant at Buenavista, as well as maintenance capital acquisitions at most of our operations. The 2012 operating cost, however, includes a charge of $316.2 million for legal fees related to our shareholders derivative lawsuit. This unique charge affects 2012 with no equivalent charge in the other years. Finally, net income in 2013 was 16.3% lower mainly due to the above factors. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2013: Year 2013 2012 2011 Copper (in million pounds) 1,360 1,406 1,295 Molybdenum (in million pounds) 44 40 41 Zinc (in million pounds) 219 198 185 Silver (in million ounces) 13 14 13 The tables below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2013: Variance Copper 2013-2012 2012-2011 (in million pounds): 2013 2012 2011 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 306.6 335.8 343.3 (29.2 ) (8.7 )% (7.5 ) (2.2 )% Cuajone 371.7 350.1 309.0 21.6 6.2 % 41.1 13.3 % La Caridad 266.2 266.0 250.5 0.2 0.1 % 15.5 6.2 % Buenavista 401.7 441.1 380.3 (39.4 ) (8.9 )% 60.8 16.0 % IMMSA 14.1 12.9 12.2 1.2 9.3 % 0.7 5.7 % Total mined copper 1,360.3 1,405.9 1,295.3 (45.6 ) (3.2 )% 110.6 8.5 % 2013 compared to 2012: Mined copper in 2013 decreased 45.6 million pounds, compared to 2012 production. This decrease was due to: · Lower production at our Buenavista mine, which experienced temporary flooding problems, · lower production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades and throughput at the concentrator, and · lower SX-EW production because of a decrease in PLS grades. Partially offset by, · higher production at the Cuajone mine resulting from higher ore grades and recoveries. 79 Table of Contents Molybdenum production increased 3.5 million pounds in 2013, compared to 2012. Molybdenum production increased in all our mines. La Caridad mine reached a new record production of 25.9 million pounds in 2013 compared to the prior year record of 24.2 million pounds. Additionally, the new Buenavista molybdenum plant which started commercial production by the end of the third quarter 2013, produced 0.8 million pounds of molybdenum. Zinc mine production from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, increased by 20.9 million pounds in 2013, 10.6% higher than in 2012, mainly as a result of higher recoveries and a full year of production at the Santa Eulalia mine after the flooding problems of prior years were resolved. Our silver production decreased slightly in 2013, compared to 2012 production, due to lower production at the Toquepala, Buenavista and La Caridad mines offset somewhat by higher production at the Cuajone and IMMSA mines. 2012 compared to 2011: Mined copper in 2012 increased 110.6 million pounds, compared to 2011 production. This increase was due to higher production at our Mexican mines and includes an additional 60.8 million pounds at the Buenavista mine, which had record production in 2012, 15.5 million pounds at the La Caridad mine, and 41.1 million pounds of higher production at the Cuajone mine. These increases in production were the result of higher ore grades and recoveries, and were partially offset by lower production at the Toquepala mine, whose production decreased by 2.2% mainly due to lower PLS copper grade and volume processed at the SX-EW plant. Molybdenum production decreased slightly in 2012, compared to 2011, due primarily to 2.0 million pounds of lower production at the Toquepala mine, as a result of lower ore grades and recoveries, offset by 1.2 million pounds and 0.2 million pounds of higher production at La Caridad mine and Cuajone mine, respectively. Zinc mine production, which comes from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, increased by 13.4 million pounds in 2012, 7.3% higher than in 2011, mainly as a result of higher recoveries and the production recovery at the Santa Eulalia mine after the flooding problems of prior years were resolved. Our silver production increased 7.2% in 2012, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine and the Cuajone mine, offset somewhat by lower production at some of our other mines. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” on page 101. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both without and with the inclusion of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. 80 Table of Contents We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced with by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, with by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the process of copper purchased from third parties, are a marginal part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs, without by-product revenues allows us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern as copper is our main source of revenues. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper with by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allow us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2013: Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1) (In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost without by-product revenues $ 2,565.3 $ 2,382.8 $ 2,139.4 $ 182.5 7.7 % $ 243.4 11.4 % Total by-product revenues (1,231.4 ) (1,429.3 ) (1,501.9 ) (197.9 ) (13.8 )% (72.6 ) (4.8 )% Total operating cash cost with by-product revenues $ 1,333.9 $ 953.5 $ 637.5 $ 380.4 39.9 % $ 316.0 49.6 % Total pounds of copper produced 1,338.8 1,377.4 1,259.5 (38.6 ) (2.8 )% 117.9 9.4 % Operating cash cost per pound without by-product revenues $ 1.92 $ 1.73 $ 1.70 $ 0.19 11.0 % $ 0.03 1.8 % Operating cash cost per pound with by-product revenues $ 1.00 $ 0.69 $ 0.51 $ 0.31 44.9 % $ 0.18 35.3 % ______________________________ (1) These are non-GAAP measures, see page 101 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. 2013 compared to 2012: As seen on the chart above, operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.19 per pound higher than in 2012, an increase of 11.0%, due to higher production cost. Production cost increases were primarily, from Peruvian labor cost, as a result of the new collective bargaining agreements, and higher fuel and power costs. In addition, there were increases in some of the other operating material we use in our operations, including tires, explosives and reagents. 81 Table of Contents Our cash cost per pound for 2013 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.00 per pound, compared to $0.69 per pound in 2012. In addition to the increase in production cost, lower sales prices of our main by-products reduced the positive contribution of by-product revenues. 2012 compared to 2011: Operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.03 per pound higher than in 2011, an increase of 1.8%, mainly due to increases in fuel and power cost, partially offset by the lowering effect on unit cost from higher production. Our cash cost per pound for 2012 when calculated with by-product revenues was $0.69 per pound, compared to $0.51 per pound in 2011. The increase was largely as result of lower prices for our major by-products, which decreased in a range from 11% to 18% in the period. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. For 2014, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 8.7 $ 28.0 $ 1.3 $ 9.6 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three operating segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, that service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 19 “Segment and Related Information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian Nuevo sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian currency and Mexican currency occur our operating results can be affected. In recent years we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information. Capital Investment Program: We made capital expenditures of $1,703.3 million, $1,051.9 million and $612.9 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In general, the capital expenditures and investment projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. 82 Table of Contents The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2013 (in millions): Peruvian projects: 2013 2012 2011 Tia Maria — Arequipa $ 41.1 $ 7.8 $ 1.6 Toquepala projects 56.7 32.7 76.0 Cuajone mine south area slope stability program 59.4 — — Cuajone projects 9.6 52.0 38.9 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 0.9 1.3 0.7 Ilo three power sub-station 5.9 11.9 9.8 Sub-total projects 173.6 105.7 127.0 Maintenance and replacement 198.7 152.2 78.5 Total Peruvian expenditures 372.3 257.9 205.5 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine expansion 167.9 216.3 97.4 New Buenavista concentrator 388.3 149.0 7.7 Buenavista projects infrastructure 39.0 69.1 9.0 Buenavista SX-EW plant III 226.7 138.3 6.5 Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material, (Quebalix III) 8.1 16.1 13.6 Quebalix IV 54.0 — — Buenavista molybdenum plant 19.0 17.0 1.2 Buenavista mine and facilities rehabilitation — 96.7 El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 1.3 1.5 9.4 La Caridad Flash furnace and acid plant modernization 39.5 5.9 1.7 Santa Eulalia pumping system 1.8 4.9 9.6 Angangueo project 9.0 3.6 6.5 Sub-total projects 954.6 621.7 259.3 Maintenance and replacement 376.4 172.3 148.1 Total Mexican expenditures 1,331.0 794.0 407.4 Total capital expenditures $ 1,703.3 $ 1,051.9 $ 612.9 Capital expenditures were a record in 2013, 61.9% higher than in 2012. The increase reflects our strong commitment to the growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company. In 2014, we plan to invest $2.3 billion in capital projects. As we previously disclosed our investment program aims to increase copper production capacity approximately 87% by 2017, from 630,000 tons to 1,175,000 tons. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principle capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico Buenavista Projects: We continue developing our $3.4 billion investment program at this unit, which is expected to increase its copper production capacity by approximately 171%, from 180,000 tons to 488,000 tons by 2015, as well as, to increase molybdenum production. As part of the expansion program at this unit, we expect to start copper production at our 120,000 ton capacity SX-EW III plant in the second quarter of 2014 and to have a full year production at our molybdenum plant. The new concentrator with molybdenum circuit project includes a concentrator with an estimated annual production capacity of 188,000 tons of copper and a second molybdenum plant with a 2,600 ton capacity. In addition, the project is expected to produce annually 2.3 million ounces of silver and 21,000 ounces of gold. The total capital budget of the project is $1,383.6 million and through December 31, 2013 it has a 62.9% progress with an investment of $544.9 million. The project is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015. Four of the six ball mills acquired for the project have been installed; we are currently in the process of installing the remaining two. Regarding the mine equipment acquisition, through December 31, 2013 we have spent $481.7 million from a total budget of $504.8 million and have received 60 of 61 trucks, the seven shovels and the eight drills required. 83 Table of Contents The SX-EW III project is moving forward to completion with an overall progress of 81.6% at December 31, 2013. The total capital budget of the project is $444.0 million of which we have spent $373.6 million through December 31, 2013. The project production capacity is 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year and it is expected to start operating in the second quarter of 2014. Quebalix IV change in scope. As previously reported, this project will improve the SX-EW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing hauling cost, as well as processing time. Recently, we have reassessed the project’s crushing capacity and found that by increasing it from 40 to 80 million tons per year, it could eliminate the need for an additional Quebalix facility in the future and operate at a lower unit cost. On January 30, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the described change in scope, increasing the total capital budget of the project by $100 million, to $340 million. The project is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015. The remaining projects to complete the $3.4 billion budgeted program include investments in infrastructure, land acquisition and other facilities at Buenavista. Angangueo: The project is moving forward as scheduled to develop this underground polymetallic deposit in Michoacan, Mexico. With an estimated investment of $174.7 million, Angangueo includes a concentrator plant which will have an estimated average annual metal content production of 10,400 tons of copper and 7,000 tons of zinc in the first seven years. Over the life of the mine, average annual concentrate production is expected to contain 2.4 million ounces of silver and 1,500 ounces of gold. The project is scheduled to begin production in the first half of 2015. Through December 31, 2013 we have spent $19.0 million on the project and in 2014 we expect to begin the acquisition of the principal equipment and to start the selection process for the construction contractors. Projects in Peru Tia Maria Project: In the fourth quarter we successfully held the two workshops and the public hearing required as part of the approval process for the new EIA of the project. We expect to receive approval of the EIA as well as construction permits by the end of the second quarter 2014. Considering this time line, the Tia Maria project is expected to start-up production late in 2016. The project capacity is 120,000 tons of copper per year. Toquepala Projects: Through December 31, 2013, we have spent a total $288.5 million on Toquepala projects. These projects include the construction of a new in-pit crusher and conveyor belt system at a cost of $88.5 million to replace current mine rail haulage, which we expect will reduce annual operating cost by approximately $5.5 million. Regarding Toquepala expansion, the project continues progressing favorably after having reached agreements with local communities. With an estimated cost of $1.0 billion, this project will increase annual production of Toquepala by 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum. Cuajone Projects: Through December 31, 2013, we have spent $146 million of a total budget of $157 million on two projects to increase productivity through technological improvements in this unit: (i) the Variable Cut-off Ore Grade project and (ii) the HPGR project. A Cuajone production increment of 6.2% in 2013 shows the results of the variable cut-off ore grade project, which was completed in the first quarter 2013 at a cost of $112 million. The HPGR project, which will produce a more finely crushed material, is currently in the ramping up stage and we expect to reach full capacity during the first quarter 2014. The project will improve copper recovery and generate cost savings by reducing power consumption in the crushing process. The total project budget is $45 million of which we have spent $34 million as of December 31, 2013. We expect that both projects will be at full capacity by the first half 2014. The project to improve slope stability at the south area of the Cuajone mine, will remove approximately 148 million tons of waste material in order to improve the mine design without reducing our actual production level. The mine equipment acquired includes one shovel, five trucks, one drill and auxiliary equipment. Besides preparing the mine for the future, this investment will avoid a reduction in average ore grade between 2014 and 2018, while maintaining current production levels. At December 31, 2013, we have spent $59.4 million of a total budget of $65.1 million. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first 84 Table of Contents stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam are finished. We are preparing bidding documents for the second stage that includes engineering and procurement to improve and increase the dam’s embankment. The project has a total budgeted cost of $66.0 million with $49.9 million expended through December 31, 2013. Other potential projects El Arco: El Arco is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 1.5 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.416% and 0.14 grams of gold per ton. In 2010, we concluded the feasibility study and an investment of $56.4 million was approved for land acquisition required for the project. This project, when developed, is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Through December 31, 2013 we have spent $40.9 million on studies, exploration and land acquisition for the project. In 2014, we expect to continue investing in land acquisition and exploration. In addition, we will begin an engineering study to determine the best way to optimize the investment in the project. Exploration projects: We have a number of exploration projects that we may develop in the future. We are currently involved in active exploration activities in Peru, Mexico, Chile and, more recently, in Ecuador and Argentina. For more information regarding our exploration activities, please see “Exploration Activities” in part I, Item 1. Business. We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, environmental concerns, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing, if required. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, estimated mine stripping ratios, leachable material and related amortization, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation and contingencies, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax positions, fair value of financial instruments, and inventory obsolescence. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.00 per pound for copper and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average 85 Table of Contents prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserves estimates in this report use the following average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31: 2013 2012 2011 Copper ($ per pound) $ 3.65 $ 3.68 $ 3.26 Molybdenum ($ per pound) $ 12.74 $ 14.52 $ 13.95 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices, for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves will not change significantly. Please see Item 2- Properties - caption “Ore reserves.” Long-term inventory - Leachable Material: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. The cost attributed to the produced leach material is charged to cost of sales generally over a five-year period (the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine). However, a change in the five year-cycle generally would not have a material impact on our financial results as our production is largely from non-leach material. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Derivative Instruments: We utilize certain types of derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and to enhance our return on Company assets. Derivative contracts are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based on market and/or dealer quotations and in certain cases valuation modeling. From time to time we have entered into copper and zinc swap contracts to protect a fixed copper and zinc price for portions of our metal sales, hedging contracts to fix fuel prices for a portion of our production costs, interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain of our bank obligations with variable interest rates and currency swap arrangements to ensure Mexican peso/ U.S. dollar 86 Table of Contents conversion rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings as follows: copper and zinc derivatives are included in net sales, gain and losses related to fuel costs are included in cost of sales and all other are included in “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments.” Changes in the fair value of copper derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in sales as the hedged copper sales occur. Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Taxes” to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $3.00 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $10.00 per pound, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $8.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.76 to 7.10 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. 87 Table of Contents IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In 2013 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the following Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “ASC”). ASU No. 2013-04: On February 28, 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-04 “Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the Reporting Date.” The objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance (e.g. debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings) is fixed at the reporting date, except for obligations addressed within existing guidance in U.S. GAAP. The amendments require all entities to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date, as the sum of the following: · The amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors, and · Any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. It is also required that an entity discloses the nature and amount of the obligation as well as other information about those obligations. These changes will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 with early adoption permitted. The Company will apply this guidance in any future arrangement. ASU No. 2013-05: In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05 an update of Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) to clarify the treatment of cumulative translation adjustments when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity. The updated guidance resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages in a foreign entity. These changes will be effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position. ASU No. 2013-11: In July 2013 the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11 “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists” (Topic 740 Income Taxes). The updated guidance requires an entity to net its unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating loss carry forward, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforwards. A gross presentation will be required only if such carryforward are not available or would not be used by the entity to settle any additional income tax resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax position. The update is effective prospectively for fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position. PROVISIONALLY PRICED SALES The following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Provisionally Priced Sales 2013 2012 2011 Copper Millions of pounds 16.1 19.7 64.3 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 3.34 $ 3.59 $ 3.44 Molybdenum Millions of pounds 10.3 8.8 10.3 Priced at average of (per pound) $ 9.70 $ 11.60 $ 13.35 88 Table of Contents Provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Provisional Sales Adjustments 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Copper $ 1.0 $ 2.9 $ 1.4 Molybdenum 0.6 3.7 (3.4 ) Total $ 1.6 $ 6.6 $ (2.0 ) Management believes that the final pricing of these sales will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

The decrease was principally the result of lower copper prices and sales volume as well as lower prices for our major by-products partially offset by higher sales volume of molybdenum, zinc and silver. Copper made up 78.2% of net sales in 2013, compared to 77.0% in 2012. Sales of by-products in 2013 totaled $1,298.1 million, compared to $1,532.4 million in 2012, a decrease of 15.3%. 2012-2011: Net sales in 2012 were $6,669.3 million, compared to a record $6,818.7 million in 2011, a decrease of $149.4 million. The decrease was principally the result of lower metal prices. Net sales in 2011 include a gain of $13.5 million on copper hedges. 89 Table of Contents The table below outlines the average published market metals prices for our metals for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013: % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 Copper price ($ per pound - LME) $ 3.32 $ 3.61 $ 4.00 (8.0 )% (9.8 )% Copper price ($ per pound - COMEX) $ 3.34 $ 3.61 $ 4.01 (7.5 )% (10.0 )% Molybdenum price ($ per pound)(1) $ 10.26 $ 12.62 $ 15.33 (18.7 )% (17.7 )% Zinc price ($ per pound — LME) $ 0.87 $ 0.88 $ 0.99 (1.1 )% (11.1 )% Silver price ($ per ounce - COMEX) $ 23.82 $ 31.19 $ 35.18 (23.6 )% (11.3 )% (1) Platt’s Metals Week Dealer Oxide.

The $24.1 million increase in expenses in 2013 was due to: · $(63.7) million of higher interest expense as a result of the $1.5 billion notes issued in November 2012, · $(18.2) million of a 2012 gain in the sale of our shares of Compania Internacional Minera, a mining company in which we had a minority participation, partially offset by · $39.5 million of higher capitalized interest due to increased capital expenditures principally at our Mexican operations, and · $18.4 million received in 2013 from Coimolache as a return of funds provided during the exploration stage of the Tantahuatay mine. These funds were originally expensed on our financial statements. 91 Table of Contents 2012-2011: Non-operating income and expense were a net expense of $135.4 million in 2012 compared to a net expense of $176.7 million in 2011. The $41.3 million decrease in expense in 2012 is due to: · $23.5 million of higher capitalized interest principally due to the Buenavista capital investment program, · $18.2 million gain on sale of our shares of Compania Internacional Minera, a Mexican mining company in which we had a minority participation, · $10.6 million of net gain on short-term investment due to an increase in the mark to market value, partially offset by · $(9.4) million of higher interest expense as a result of the new debt issued in November 2012. Income taxes 2013 2012 2011 Provision for income taxes $ 769.3 $ 1,080.9 1,104.3 Effective income tax rate 32.4 % 36.3 % 32.0 % The income tax provision includes Peruvian, Mexican and U.S. federal and state income taxes. The higher effective income tax rate in 2012 was principally due to a $316.2 million one-time payment of legal fees related to the SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit, which is being treated as a non-deductible expense. In 2013, the Mexican Congress enacted tax law changes that became effective on January 1, 2014. Among other things the law maintains the statutory rate at 30%, eliminating rate decreases scheduled to take effect for 2014 and 2015. In addition, the law has made the tax consolidation rules more restrictive. The impact of these changes increased our deferred income tax provision in 2013 by $34.7 million. Please see Note 7 “Income taxes” for a more complete description of the tax changes. Equity earnings of affiliate In 2013 and 2012 we have recognized $20.9 million and 48.7 million of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2013 was $5.7 million, compared to $6.7 million in 2012, and $7.9 million in 2011 a decrease of $1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. These decreases were the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Net income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2013 was $1,618.5 million, compared to $1,934.6 million in 2012 and $2,336.4 million in 2011. Net income attributable to SCC decreased mainly as a result of the decrease in metal prices and other factors described above. SEGMENT RESULTS ANALYSIS We have three segments: the Peruvian operations, the Mexican open-pit operations and the Mexican underground mining operations. Please see a detail definition of them on Item 1 Business — “Business Reporting Segments.” The following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant by-products, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2013: Variance Copper Sales (million pounds) 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Peruvian operations 680.1 703.0 694.5 (22.9 ) 8.5 Mexican open-pit 702.3 711.6 626.0 (9.3 ) 85.6 Mexican IMMSA unit 17.3 18.8 15.5 (1.5 ) 3.3 Other and intersegment elimination (17.3 ) (18.8 ) (15.5 ) 1.5 (3.3 ) Total copper sales 1,382.4 1,414.6 1,320.5 (32.2 ) 94.1 92 Table of Contents By-product Sales (million pounds, except silver - Variance million ounces) 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Peruvian operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 17.2 16.1 18.0 1.1 (1.9 ) Silver 3.4 3.8 3.5 (0.4 ) 0.3 Mexican open-pit operations: Molybdenum contained in concentrate 26.7 24.1 23.1 2.6 1.0 Silver 10.1 9.1 7.1 1.0 2.0 IMMSA unit Zinc-refined and in concentrate 218.5 205.9 199.9 12.6 6.0 Silver 4.9 5.4 5.2 (0.5 ) 0.2 Other and intersegment elimination Zinc — — — — Silver (1.8 ) (2.1 ) (1.6 ) 0.3 (0.5 ) Total by-product sales Molybdenum contained in concentrate 43.9 40.2 41.1 3.7 (0.9 ) Zinc-refined and in concentrate 218.5 205.9 199.9 12.6 6.0 Silver 16.6 16.2 14.2 0.4 2.0 Peruvian Open-pit Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, Variance 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Net sales $ 2,614.6 $ 2,952.3 $ 3,186.5 $ (337.7 ) $ (234.2 ) Operating costs and expenses (1,606.2 ) (1,603.8 ) (1,644.4 ) (2.4 ) 40.6 Operating income $ 1,008.4 $ 1,348.5 $ 1,542.1 $ (340.1 ) $ (193.6 ) Net sales: 2013-2012: Net sales in 2013 decreased $337.7 million, compared to 2012, primarily due to the decrease in market prices of our principal products and lower sales volume of copper partially offset by higher molybdenum sales volume. 2012-2011: Net sales in 2012 decreased $234.2 million, compared to 2011, primarily due to the decrease in the price of copper and the prices of our major by-products. Operating costs and expenses: 2013-2012: Operating costs and expenses in 2013 increased $2.4 million, compared to 2012, principally due to: Operating cost and expenses for 2012 $ 1,603.8 Plus: · higher depreciation, amortization and depletion due to the acquisition of mine equipment, 16.9 · higher general and administrative expenses, and 1.3 · higher exploration expenses. 6.1 Less: · lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), mainly due to lower mining royalties, cost of metals purchased from third parties, inventory consumption and workers´ participation; partially offset by higher production cost (higher labor cost due to the new collective bargaining agreements and higher operating and repair costs due to cost inflation). (21.9 ) Operating cost and expenses for 2013 $ 1,606.2 93 Table of Contents 2012-2011: Operating costs and expenses in 2012 decreased $40.5 million, compared to 2011, principally due to: Operating cost and expenses for 2011 $ 1,644.4 Less: · lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), principally as a result of lower cost of metals purchased from third parties; partially offset by higher inventory consumption and production cost (labor, fuel and power and operating and repair material costs).

Molybdenum sales volume increased due to a new record production at La Caridad mine and the first production of the new molybdenum plant at the Buenavista mine. We estimate that approximately 50.6 million pounds of copper sales were lost as a result of the flooding problems. 2012-2011: Net sales in 2012 increased by $126.9 million, compared to 2011, largely as a result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista, which had a production record of 441.0 million pounds of copper, partially offset by lower prices for copper and for our principal by-products. Operating costs and expenses: 2013-2012: Operating costs and expenses in 2013 increased $113.0 million, compared to 2012, principally due to: Operating cost and expenses for 2012 $ 1,413.4 Plus: · higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), principally as a result of higher inventory consumption and production cost (labor, fuel and power and operating and repair material costs); partially offset by lower cost of metals purchased from third parties, sales expenses and workers´participation. 80.7 · higher depreciation, amortization and depletion due to the acquisition of mine equipment, and 33.3 · higher general and administrative expenses. 1.0 Less: · lower exploration expenses (2.0 ) Operating cost and expenses for 2013 $ 1,526.4 94 Table of Contents 2012-2011: Operating costs and expenses in 2012 increased $126.4 million, compared to 2011, principally due to: Operating cost and expenses for 2011 $ 1,287.0 Plus: · higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), principally as a result of higher production cost (labor, fuel and power and operating and repair material costs), higher workers’ participation and higher currency translation effect; partially offset by lower inventory consumption and other cost of sales. 112.4 · higher depreciation, amortization and depletion, 12.0 · higher exploration expenses, and 1.7 · higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 0.3 Operating cost and expenses for 2012 $ 1,413.4 IMMSA unit Twelve Months Ended December 31, Variance 2013 2012 2011 2013-2012 2012-2011 Net sales $ 458.5 $ 513.0 $ 546.2 $ (54.5 ) $ (33.2 ) Operating costs and expenses (394.0 ) (360.4 ) (370.5 ) (33.6 ) 10.1 Operating income $ 64.5 $ 152.6 $ 175.7 $ (88.1 ) $ (23.1 ) Net sales: 2013-2012: Net sales in 2013 decreased $54.5 million, compared to 2012, mainly due to lower metal prices of zinc and silver, partially offset by higher zinc sales volume mainly from the Santa Eulalia mine which restored production after resolving its prior years flooding problems. 2012-2011: Net sales in 2012 decreased $33.2 million, compared to 2011 mainly due to lower metal prices of zinc and silver, partially offset by higher zinc sales volume mainly from the Santa Eulalia mine which partially restored production after resolving its prior years flooding problems.

Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2014 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, which was increased in 2013 to $2 billion. Since the inception of the program we have purchased 57.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1,159.5 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 - SCC common stock repurchase plan. Dividend: On January 30, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock payable on March 4, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2014. SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit: On October 9, 2012, we received from AMC, our majority shareholder, $2.1 billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the Court of Chancery of Delaware which concluded that we paid an excessive price to AMC in the 2005 merger between the Company and Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. From the aforementioned sum received from AMC, we paid $316.2 million to the plaintiff’s attorneys to satisfy the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. The effect of these transactions was recorded in our 2012 results. FINANCING In November 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $22.5 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. This debt was issued in two tranches, $300 million due in 2022 at an annual interest rate of 3.5% and $1.2 billion due in 2042 at an annual interest rate of 5.25%. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our capital expenditure program. In 2013, World Finance, an international business magazine, recognized this debt as the best international debt issuance of the year in the mining industry. Our total debt at December 31, 2013 was $4,204.9 million, compared to $4,213.9 million at December 31, 2012, net of the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $46.2 million and $47.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in total debt during 2013 was due to the final payment of the Mitsui loan. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 43.1% at December 31, 2013, compared to 46.8% at December 31, 2012. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 31.3% at December 31, 2013, compared to 26.8% at December 31, 2012. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net 99 Table of Contents capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” below. Please see Note 10 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013: Payments due by Period Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 4,251.1 — $ 200.0 — — — $ 4,051.1 Interest on debt 5,726.4 $ 261.9 256.3 $ 249.0 $ 248.9 $ 248.9 4,461.4 Uncertain tax position(a) 221.2 — — — — — — Workers’ participation 192.3 192.3 — — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 32.8 3.1 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 17.9 Asset retirement obligation 124.8 — — — — — 124.8 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 8,551.3 463.2 546.5 597.6 433.1 348.6 6,162.3 Capital expenditure projects 1,142.2 910.3 231.9 — — — — Total $ 20,242.1 $ 1,830.8 $ 1,237.5 $ 849.5 $ 685.0 $ 600.6 $ 14,817.5 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2013 the liability recognized by the Company is $221.2 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account of $46.2 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2013. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 11 “Benefit Plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 100 Table of Contents 13 “Commitment and Contingencies”. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. For 2014, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.01 $ 1.00 $ 0.01 $ 1.0 Annual change in net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 8.7 $ 28.0 $ 1.3 $ 9.6 Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper and molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. Following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2013: Sales volume (million lbs.) Priced at (per pound) Month of settlement Copper 16.1 $ 3.34 January through February 2014 Molybdenum 10.3 $ 9.70 January through April 2014 Provisional sales price adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December, 31, 2013 were $1.0 million for copper and $0.6 million for molybdenum Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso, to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 2.9 % 2.6 % 4.8 % Initial exchange rate 2.551 2.697 2.809 Closing exchange rate 2.796 2.551 2.697 Appreciation/(devaluation) (9.6 )% 5.4 % 4.0 % Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 4.0 % 3.6 % 3.8 % Initial exchange rate 13.010 13.979 12.357 Closing exchange rate 13.077 13.010 13.979 Appreciation/(devaluation) (0.5 )% 6.9 % (13.1 )% 103 Table of Contents Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2013, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 5.9 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (4.9 ) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 37.1 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (30.4 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2013. Copper hedges: In 2011, we entered into copper swaps and zero cost collar derivative contracts to reduce price volatility and to protect our sales value as shown below. These transactions meet the requirements of hedge accounting. The realized gains and losses from these derivatives were recorded in net sales on the consolidated statement of earnings and included in operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. At December 31, 2012 and 2013 we did not hold any copper hedge positions. Short-term investments: Short-term investments were as follows (in millions): At December 31, 2013 2012 Trading securities $ 202.6 $ 127.8 Weighted average interest rate 3.78 % 1.87 % Available-for- sale $ 5.7 $ 6.5 Weighted average interest rate 0.42 % 0.43 % Total $ 208.3 $ 134.3 Trading securities consist of bonds issued by public companies and are publicly traded. Each financial instrument is independent of the others. We have the intention to sell these bonds in the short-term. Available-for-sale investments consist of securities issued by public companies. Each security is independent of the others and, as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 included corporate bonds and asset and mortgage backed obligations. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material. Related to these investments we earned interest, which was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings. Also, we redeemed some of these securities and recognized gains (losses) due to changes in fair value, which were recorded as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings. The following table summarizes the activity of these investments by category (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2013 2012 Trading: Interest earned $ 5.2 $ 3.1 Unrealized gain (loss) at December 31, $ (1.9 ) $ 2.4 Available-for-sale: Interest earned (* ) $ 0.1 Investment redeemed $ 0.8 $ 1.9 (*) Less than $0.1 million 104 Table of Contents At December 31, 2013 and 2012, contractual maturities of our available-for-sale debt securities are as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 One year or less $ 0.4 $ 0.4 Maturing after one year through five years — — Maturing after five years through ten years 0.2 — Due after 10 years 5.1 6.1 Total debt securities $ 5.7 $ 6.5 105 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:28.095513
1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2015,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” the” Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business - Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2014, we invested $1,534.8 million in capital programs along with $74.6 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2014, our copper ore reserves totaled 69.9 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, our internal ore reserve estimation value is as follows: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 34,266 Peruvian operations 23,719 IMMSA 213 Development projects 11,748 Total 69,946 Outlook: Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, some of the following: · Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2014, the average LME copper price was $3.11 per pound and the average COMEX copper price was $3.12 per pound, about 6.3% and 6.6% lower than in 2013, respectively. In 2014, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $2.86 to $3.37. Average molybdenum and zinc prices in 2014 increased 10.1% and 12.6%, respectively, compared to 2013. Average silver prices in 2014 decreased 20.1% compared to 2013. · Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 78% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 7% from molybdenum, 6% from silver, 3% from zinc and 6% from various other products, principally sulfuric acid and gold. 63 Table of Contents · Copper: Regarding the copper market, we believe the recent reduction in copper prices results from copper following oil for technical reasons, not related to the copper market or fundamentals. We also believe the current relative softness in copper prices will start to change as we move into the second quarter of 2015. As we have indicated in the past, we believe short-term copper demand is consistently improving. For 2015, we expect the improvement in the U.S. economy to keep pulling new copper demand. We also believe we will see higher demand coming from Western Europe. China’s growth is expected to be limited by its housing market slowdown, however, the Chinese electric grid plans to expand investments by 24%, will support copper demand growth of about 4% for China. On the supply side, we think that several structural factors will continue to affect supply from new projects and existing operations, as well as scrap production. The current views by analysts on the 2015 copper market ranges between balance and a surplus of 300,000 tons surplus. In the majority of these estimates, surplus expectations are significantly down from a year ago. Due to such factors as delays in project startups, technical problems, labor unrest and other difficulties, we believe the market will trend to balance as we move through 2015. We want to emphasize that prices at current levels are not sufficient to promote the necessary future supply growth, for which reason we believe that in the long-term, prices will increase to meet those needs, thereby improving the strong long term fundamentals of our industry. · Molybdenum: Our most significant by-product, represented 8.8% of sales in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we saw a price deterioration for molybdenum consistent with our outlook of a 10% worldwide supply growth in 2015 coming from our Buenavista operation, as well as from Sierra Gorda, Toromocho and Caserones, among other projects. Demand for molybdenum will be affected in 2015 by lower demand for special alloys coming from the oil drilling industry. This will add to the above mentioned supply issues. Even though the current scenario for molybdenum prices is not positive, it is important to note that about 50% of the supply of this metal comes from primary or dedicated molybdenum mines, which have a cash cost in the range of $9-$12 per pound. This creates a natural barrier for the molybdenum market to adjust production volume and thereby protect low cost secondary molybdenum producers such as our Company. Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. · Silver: Represented 4.7% of our sales in 2014 and it is currently our second most significant by-product. Silver prices averaged $19.04 per ounce in 2014, 20.1% lower than its price in 2013. We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. · Zinc: Represented 3.6% of our sales in 2014. We also believe that zinc has very good long-term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns. In the last 12 months, zinc inventories have consistently decreased, improving this market’s fundamentals. We are expecting an increasing price scenario for zinc in the next few years. · Production: For 2015, improvements in operational practices and capital investments will reduce costs and increase the Company’s copper and molybdenum production. We plan to produce 782,300 tons of copper, which will set a new record for SCC copper production. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed the construction of a new SX-EW plant that is expected to significantly increase production of leachable material by approximately 120,000 tons per year. For this guidance we are considering that our Buenavista operation will produce 344,700 tons. Of those, a total of 163,300 tons will come from our new projects. The SX-EW III plant will contribute with 102,300 tons and the new concentrator at Buenavista will add 61,000 tons. We expect to produce 21,500 tons of molybdenum in 2015, 7% lower than our 2014 production, this variance is due to lower ore grades and recoveries at our operations. 64 Table of Contents In 2015, we also expect to produce 12.7 million ounces of silver and produce 86,200 tons of zinc, an increase of almost 20,000 tons of zinc compared to 2014. · Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three-years ended December 2014 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 2014 2013 2012(*) Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 3,554.9 $ 3,420.8 $ 3,244.2 Percentage increase from prior year 3.9 % 5.5 % 1.6 % (*) Operating costs and expenses for 2012 does not include a one-time expense of $316.2 million, for legal fees related to a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Accordingly, operating costs and expenses for 2012 is a non-GAAP measure, please see subheading “Non-GAAP information reconciliation”, for a reconciliation of this to a GAAP measure in this Item 7. Operating costs and expenses in 2014 increased $134.1 million, compared to 2013, principally due to a $91.4 million environmental remediation provision for the spill at Buenavista, higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our operations and higher exploration spending. Operating costs and expenses in 2013 increased $176.6 million, compared to 2012 mainly due to higher cost of sales that was largely caused by the higher cost of fuel, power and labor. The sharp decrease in the purchase and sale of third-party metal concentrates in the 2013 and 2012 years, helped reduce cost of sales; but higher depreciation, caused by the completion and placing in service of some capital assets for both our Buenavista expansion program and our maintenance programs offset those reductions in overall operating costs. · Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures were $1,534.8 million for 2014, 114.7% of net income and 9.9% lower than in 2013. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is fully underway. For 2015, we plan to invest $2.7 billion in capital projects, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to 2014 and 201.6% of 2014’s net income. As we have previously reported, our investment program aims to increase copper production capacity by approximately 89% from our 2013 production level of 617,000 tons to 1,165,000 tons by 2018. The $2.7 billion investment will be mainly to (i) complete the expansion of the Buenavista mine, which will reach a production capacity of 488,000 tons of copper per year; (ii) expansion of Toquepala which will increase annual production capacity by 100,000 tons of copper and; (iii) construction of our Tia Maria project which will produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year. · Buenavista del Cobre copper solution spill: On August 6, 2014, an accidental spill of approximately 40,000 cubic meters of copper sulfate solution occurred at a leaching pond that was under construction ten kilometers away from the mine of Buenavista del Cobre, S.A. de C.V. (“BVC”), a subsidiary of the Company. The accident was caused by a rock collapse that affected the system’s pumping station and by a construction defect in the seal of a pipe in the leaching system containment dam, a part of the new SX-EW III plant. This solution reached the Bacanuchi River, a branch of the Sonora River. All the immediate actions were properly taken in order to contain the spill, and to comply with all the legal requirements. On September 15, 2014, BVC, in agreement with the Mexican Federal Government, established a trust of up to two billion pesos (approximately $150 million) to support the remedial efforts that BVC had already undertaken, to comply with the environmental remediation plan and to pay, as the case may be, material damages to the riverside residents of the seven counties affected by the spill. In 2014, BVC estimated the contingent liability at $91.4 million, of which $16.4 million had been paid previous to the establishment of the trust, and approximately one billion pesos (approximately $74.9 million) was deposited in the trust. These funds have been available and have been used to compensate claims as they have arisen. This deposit was classified as restricted cash and was recorded as an operating expense in the 2014 results. A technical committee was created to manage the funds, comprised of representatives from the federal government, the Company and specialists assisted by a team of environmental experts. The trust established by the Company and the administrative agreement executed with the corresponding Federal authorities, serves as an alternative mechanism for dispute resolution to mitigate public and private litigation risks. 65 Table of Contents KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Variance 2014 2013 2012 2014-2013 2013-2012 Net sales $ 5,787.7 $ 5,952.9 $ 6,669.3 $ (165.2 ) $ (716.4 ) Operating income 2,232.8 2,532.1 3,108.9 (299.3 ) (576.8 ) Net income attributable to SCC $ 1,333.0 $ 1,618.5 $ 1,934.6 $ (285.5 ) $ (316.1 ) Earnings per share $ 1.61 $ 1.92 $ 2.28 $ (0.31 ) $ (0.36 ) Dividends per share $ 0.46 $ 0.68 $ 4.06 $ (0.22 ) $ (3.38 ) Pounds of copper sold 1,448 1,382 1,415 66 (33 ) Net sales decreased in the three-year period from 2012 to 2014, due to lower metal prices for copper and silver, partially offset by an increase in copper and molybdenum sales volumes. The 2014 copper and molybdenum sales volume increased by 4.7% and 16.1%, respectively. The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, the latter of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2014, cost of sales decreased by $30.8 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $49.0 million. The decrease in cost of sales was due to lower cost of metals purchased from third parties, labor costs, workers’ participation expense, mining royalties, net currency translation effect and inventory consumption. The increase in depreciation was mainly due to maintenance capital acquisitions at most of our operations. The 2012 operating cost includes a charge of $316.2 million for legal fees related to our shareholders derivative lawsuit. This unique charge affects 2012 with no equivalent charge in the other years. In addition, the 2014 operating results include a charge for costs of remediating the spill at Buenavista. Net income in 2014 was 17.6% lower mainly due to the above noted factors. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2014: Variance Year 2014-2013 2013-2012 2014 2013 2012 Volume % Volume % (million pounds, except silver — million ounces) Copper 1,491.6 1,360.3 1,405.9 131.3 9.7 % (45.6 ) (3.2 )% Molybdenum 51.0 43.9 40.3 7.1 16.2 % 3.6 8.7 % Zinc 146.9 219.1 198.2 (72.2 ) (33.0 )% 20.9 10.6 % Silver 13.0 13.5 13.6 (0.5 ) (3.9 )% (0.1 ) (1.0 )% 66 Table of Contents The tables below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2014: Variance Copper 2014-2013 2013-2012 (in million pounds): 2014 2013 2012 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 309.7 306.6 335.8 3.1 1.0 % (29.2 ) (8.7 )% Cuajone 393.2 371.7 350.1 21.5 5.8 % 21.6 6.2 % La Caridad 278.4 266.2 266.0 12.2 4.6 % 0.2 0.1 % Buenavista 498.8 401.7 441.1 97.1 24.2 % (39.4 ) (8.9 )% IMMSA 11.5 14.1 12.9 (2.6 ) (18.7 )% 1.2 9.3 % Total mined copper 1,491.6 1,360.3 1,405.9 131.3 9.7 % (45.6 ) (3.2 )% 2014 compared to 2013: Mined copper in 2014 increased 131.3 million pounds, compared to 2013 production. This increase was due to: · Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to higher throughput at the concentrator and better ore grades and recoveries, as well as higher production from the SX-EW III plant. · Higher production at the Toquepala mine and La Caridad mine due to better ore grades and recoveries. · Higher production at the Cuajone mine resulting from higher ore grades and increased throughput from the HPGR production, partially offset by · lower production at IMMSA mines due to problems at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines; an accident occurred at the Charcas mine that temporarily restricted production while the Santa Eulalia mine experienced flooding problems. Molybdenum production increased 7.1 million pounds in 2014, compared to 2013, mainly at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines. Zinc mine production from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, decreased by 72.2 million pounds in 2014, 33.0% lower than in 2013, mainly as a result of lower grades at all our IMMSA mines and lower production at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines, as discussed above. Our silver production decreased in 2014, compared to 2013 production, due to lower production at the IMMSA mines offset by higher production at the Toquepala, Cuajone, Buenavista and La Caridad mines. 2013 compared to 2012: Mined copper in 2013 decreased 45.6 million pounds, compared to 2012 production. This decrease was due to: · Lower production at our Buenavista mine, which experienced temporary flooding problems. · Lower production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades and throughput at the concentrator, and · lower SX-EW production because of a decrease in PLS grades, all partially offset by, · higher production at the Cuajone mine resulting from higher ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production increased 3.6 million pounds in 2013, compared to 2012. Molybdenum production increased at all our mines. La Caridad mine reached a new record production of 25.9 million pounds in 2013 compared to the prior year record of 24.2 million pounds. Additionally, the new Buenavista molybdenum plant which started commercial production by the end of the third quarter 2013, produced 0.8 million pounds of molybdenum. Zinc mine production from our IMMSA unit in Mexico, increased by 20.9 million pounds in 2013, 10.6% higher than in 2012, mainly as a result of higher recoveries and a full year of production at the Santa Eulalia mine after the flooding problems of prior years were resolved. Our silver production decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 production due to lower production at the Toquepala, Buenavista and La Caridad mines offset somewhat by higher production at the Cuajone and IMMSA mines. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as 67 Table of Contents presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation,” beginning on page 88. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both without and with the inclusion of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced with by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, with by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the process of copper purchased from third parties, are a marginal part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs, without by-product revenues allows us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern as copper is our main source of revenues. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper with by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allow us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2014: 68 Table of Contents Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced (1) (In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2014-2013 2013-2012 2014 2013 2012 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost without by-product revenues $ 2,745.0 $ 2,541.4 $ 2,376.2 203.6 8.0 % $ 165.2 7.0 % Total by-product revenues (1,212.7 ) (1,207.4 ) (1,405.3 ) (5.3 ) 0.4 % 197.9 (14.1 )% Total operating cash cost with by-product revenues $ 1,532.3 $ 1,334.0 $ 970.9 198.3 14.9 % $ 363.1 37.4 % Total pounds of copper produced 1,453.2 1,338.8 1,377.4 114.4 8.5 % (38.6 ) (2.8 )% Operating cash cost per pound without by-product revenues 1.89 1.90 1.73 (0.01 ) (0.5 )% 0.17 9.8 % Operating cash cost per pound with by-product revenues 1.05 1.00 0.71 0.05 5.0 % 0.29 40.8 % (1) These are non-GAAP measures, see page 88 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. 2014 compared to 2013: As seen on the chart above, our 2014 operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues was slightly lower than in 2013, a decrease of 0.5% mainly due to the diluting effect on unit cost of higher production at all our open pit mines, more significantly from Buenavista. This increase in production volume offset the cost of higher inflation, which increased fuel, power and other operating materials for our production process. Our cash cost per pound for 2014 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.05 per pound, compared to $1.00 per pound in 2013. The by-product credit in 2014 was six cents less than in 2013. This was due to lower prices for silver and gold, and lower sales volume of silver and zinc. Higher prices for zinc and molybdenum and higher sales volume for molybdenum and gold helped to offset some of the negative factors. 2013 compared to 2012: As seen on the chart above, operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.17 per pound higher than in 2012, an increase of 9.8%, due to higher production cost. Production cost increases were primarily from Peruvian labor cost, as a result of the new collective bargaining agreements, and higher fuel and power costs. In addition, there were increases in some of the other operating material we use in our operations, including tires, explosives and reagents. Our cash cost per pound for 2013 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.00 per pound, compared to $0.71 per pound in 2012. In addition to the increase in production cost, lower sales prices of our main by-products reduced the positive contribution of by-product revenues. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. For 2015, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.0 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 99.3 $ 27.8 $ 12.7 $ 7.5 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the 69 Table of Contents smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine which produces coal and coke, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 18 “Segment and Related Information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Mexican Peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian Nuevo sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian currency and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information. Capital Investment Program: We made capital expenditures of $1,534.8 million, $1,703.3 million and $1,051.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In general, the capital expenditures and investment projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2014 (in millions): Peruvian projects: 2014 2013 2012 Tia Maria — Arequipa $ 8.5 $ 41.1 $ 7.8 Toquepala projects 65.7 56.7 32.7 Cuajone mine south area stability program 10.6 59.4 — Cuajone projects 7.0 9.6 52.0 Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 2.9 0.9 1.3 Ilo 3 power sub-station 3.7 5.9 11.9 Sub-total projects 98.4 173.6 105.7 Maintenance and replacement 255.4 198.7 152.2 Total Peruvian expenditures 353.8 372.3 257.9 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine expansion 6.7 167.9 216.3 New Buenavista concentrator 465.2 388.3 149.0 Buenavista projects infrastructure 65.8 39.0 69.1 Buenavista SX-EW plant III 175.8 226.7 138.3 Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material (Quebalix III) — 8.1 16.1 Quebalix IV 70.4 54.0 — Buenavista molybdenum plant — 19.0 17.0 El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights 0.9 1.3 1.5 La Caridad flash furnace and acid plant modernization 23.2 39.5 5.9 Santa Eulalia pumping system — 1.8 4.9 Angangueo project 9.7 9.0 3.6 New system recovery solutions 66.2 42.4 0.9 Other projects 61.3 46.2 13.7 Sub-total projects 945.2 1,043.2 636.3 Maintenance and replacement 235.8 287.8 157.7 Total Mexican expenditures 1,181.0 1,331.0 794.0 Total capital expenditures $ 1,534.8 $ 1,703.3 $ 1,051.9 70 Table of Contents In 2015, we plan to invest $2.7 billion in capital projects. As we previously disclosed, our investment program aims to increase copper production capacity by approximately 89% from our 2013 production level of 617,000 tons to 1,165,000 tons by 2018. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principle capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico: Buenavista Projects: We continue developing our $3.4 billion investment program at this unit which is expected to increase its copper production capacity by approximately 175%, as well as molybdenum production by 42%. The new copper molybdenum concentrator has an annual production capacity of 188,000 tons of copper and 2,600 tons of molybdenum. The project will additionally produce 2.3 million ounces of silver and 21,000 ounces of gold per year. The total capital budget of the project is $1,383.6 million and through December 31, 2014, the project has an 92.2% progress with an investment of $978.5 million. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. All major equipment is on site and has been installed. Regarding the mine equipment acquisition for the Buenavista expansion, through December 31, 2014 we have invested $510.9 million and have received sixty-one 400-ton capacity trucks, seven shovels and eight drills required for the mine expansion. All of this equipment is currently in operation. Performance testing for the SX-EW III plant was successfully completed and technical full capacity has been achieved in accordance with the design flow rate of the plant. Estimated annual production for the plant is 120,000 tons of copper cathodes. Capital budget of $444.0 million has been invested through December 31, 2014. The crushing, conveying and spreading system for leachable ore project (Quebalix IV) will increase production by improving SX-EW copper recovery, reducing processing time, mining and hauling costs. It has a crushing and conveying capacity of 80 million tons per year and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project has a 49.4% progress with an investment of $117.7 million out of the approved capital budget of $340 million. The remaining projects to complete the $3.4 billion budgeted program include investments in infrastructure, including power lines and substations, water supply, tailings dam, mine equipment shops, internal roads and others. Angangueo: With an estimated investment of $174.7 million, Angangueo includes a concentrator plant which will have an estimated average annual metal content production of 10,400 tons of copper and 7,000 tons of zinc in the first seven years. Over the life of the mine, average annual concentrate production is expected to contain 2.4 million ounces of silver and 1,500 ounces of gold. Through December 31, 2014 we have spent $27.3 million on the project. We are preparing the new environmental studies for this project. We will wait the authorization from SEMARNAT to resume the purchase of main equipment and work on the project. Projects in Peru: Toquepala Projects: Through December 31, 2014, we have invested a total of $346.0 million in Toquepala projects. These projects include the construction of a new crusher and conveyor belt system to replace current mine rail haulage, which we expect will reduce annual operating cost. Toquepala expansion project. On December 17, 2014 we received governmental approval of the EIA for the Toquepala concentrator expansion, which will allow us to continue developing this important project. The Toquepala concentrator expansion will increase annual production capacity by 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum at a total capital cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Cuajone Projects: Through December 31, 2014, we have invested $40.6 million of a budget of $45 million on the HPGR project, which will produce a more finely crushed material. The engineering and the purchase of equipment have been completed and the project has reached 99% completion. The project is expected to generate cost savings, improve copper recovery and reduce power consumption in the crushing process. Through December 2014, the implementation of the HPGR project and the variable cut-off ore grade project, implemented in 2013, have produced an estimated incremental production of 23,500 tons of copper. The project to improve slope stability at the south area of the Cuajone mine, will remove approximately 148 million tons of waste material, in order to improve mine design without reducing current production level. The mine equipment acquired includes one shovel, five 400-ton capacity trucks, one drill and auxiliary equipment which will be reallocated to our mine 71 Table of Contents operations once the project is finished. Besides preparing the mine for the future, this investment will avoid a reduction in average ore grade. As of December 31, 2014, 14 million tons of waste material have been removed and activities will continue for 4 additional years. At December 31, 2014, we have invested $67.7 million in this project. Tia Maria project: On August 1, 2014 we received the final approval of our EIA. We expect to be granted the authorization in the first quarter of 2015 to move forward with the construction phase and begin construction immediately thereafter. This project will be completed in the first half of 2017 with an investment of approximately $1.4 billion, to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year using state of the art technology with the highest international environmental standards. The project is currently expected to generate 3,500 jobs during the construction phase. When in operation, Tia Maria will directly employ 600 workers and indirectly another 2,000. Through its expected twenty-years of life, the project related services will create significant business opportunities in the Arequipa region. In addition, the Company intends to implement social responsibility programs in the Arequipa region similar to those established in the communities near its other Peruvian operations. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We are preparing bidding documents for the second stage that includes engineering and procurement to improve and increase the dam’s embankment. The project has a total budgeted cost of $66.0 million, with $52.7 million invested through December 31, 2014. Potential projects We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, environmental concerns, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. El Arco: El Arco is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 1.5 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.416% and 0.14 grams of gold per ton. In 2010, we concluded the feasibility study and an investment of $56.4 million was approved for land acquisition required for the project. This project, when developed, is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Through December 31, 2014 we have invested $41.3 million on studies, exploration and land acquisition for the project. In 2015, we expect to continue investing in land acquisition and exploration. In addition, we will begin an engineering study to determine the best way to optimize the investment in the project. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, leachable material and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits and fair value of financial instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 72 Table of Contents Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $9.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2014: 2014 2013 2012 Average 2014-2012 Copper ($ per pound) 3.12 3.34 3.61 3.36 Molybdenum ($ per pound) 11.30 10.26 12.62 11.39 Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices, for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2- “Properties - Ore reserves.” Leachable Material: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Through the third quarter of 2014, the cost attributed to the produced leach material was charged to cost of sales over a five-year period, which was the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine. However, the improvements in efficiency in production and use of leachable material, as a result of the completion of construction of a new plant during the fourth quarter, resulted in a change in amortization of leachable material to the units of production method. This was accounted for prospectively in 2014, and will better match costs with revenues resulting from the increases in production stemming from the new plant. As the plant entered into operation in the fourth quarter of 2014, the impact to results in 2014 was not considered significant and totaled approximately $17 million recognized within cost of sales. The Company expects that the impacts in future periods will be significant as a result of the increased production levels. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end 73 Table of Contents of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Taxes” to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using a long-term average copper price of $3.00 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $10.00 per pound, reflective of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $8.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 2.20 to 4.76 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value. 74 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.

The decrease was principally the result of lower copper and silver prices as well as lower silver and zinc sales volume, partially offset by higher molybdenum and zinc prices and higher copper and molybdenum sales volume. Copper made up 78.0% of net sales in 2014, compared to 78.2% in 2013. Sales of by-products in 2014 totaled $1,269.7 million, compared to $1,298.1 million in 2013, a decrease of 2.2%. 2013-2012: Net sales in 2013 were $5,952.9 million, compared to $6,669.3 million in 2012, a decrease of $716.4 million or 10.7%. The decrease was principally the result of lower copper prices and sales volume as well as lower prices for our major by-products partially offset by higher sales volume of molybdenum, zinc and silver. Copper made up 78.2% of net sales in 2013, compared to 77.0% in 2012. Sales of by-products in 2013 totaled $1,298.1 million, compared to $1,532.4 million in 2012, a decrease of 15.3%.

In addition, higher depreciation at our Peruvian operations from addition of new equipment. 49.0 · Higher exploration expenses mainly in South America. 23.6 · Environmental remediation expense due to the spill at Buenavista. 91.4 · Higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 0.9 Less: · Lower cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), mainly as a result of lower purchases of metals from third parties, mining royalties, labor costs, workers’ participation, net currency translation effect, inventory consumption and others. (30.8 ) Operating cost and expenses for 2014 $ 3,554.9 76 Table of Contents 2013-2012: Operating costs and expenses in 2013 decreased $126.7 million, compared to 2012, primarily due to: Operating cost and expenses for 2012 $ 3,560.4 Less: · Legal fees related to SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit in 2012. (316.2 ) Plus: · Higher cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), principally as a result of higher production cost (labor, fuel and power and repair material costs) and higher inventory consumption, partially offset by lower workers’ participation, mining royalties and cost of metals purchased from third parties. 102.1 · Higher depreciation, amortization and depletion mainly at our Mexican operations as a result of the acquisition of mine equipment and the start-up of some projects, including the Quebalix III project. 70.2 · Higher exploration expenses. 3.1 · Higher general and administrative expenses. 1.2 Operating cost and expenses for 2013 $ 3,420.8 NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Variance 2014 2013 2012 2014-2013 2013-2012 Interest expense $ (265.3 ) $ (265.5 ) $ (201.8 ) $ 0.2 $ (63.7 ) Capitalized interest 126.7 68.9 29.4 57.8 39.5 Other (expense) income (40.8 ) 17.1 21.8 (57.9 ) (4.7 ) Interest income 15.3 20.0 15.2 (4.7 ) 4.8 Total non-operating income (expense) $ (164.1 ) $ (159.5 ) $ (135.4 ) $ (4.6 ) $ (24.1 ) 2014-2013: Non-operating income and expense were a net expense of $164.1 million in 2014 compared to a net expense of $159.5 million in 2013. The $4.6 million increase in net expense in 2014 was mainly due to: · $32.7 million of higher miscellaneous expenses principally at our Peruvian operations, including unrecovered insurance expense, and, · $18.4 million income in 2013 from the return of funds from Coimolache, expended during the exploration stage of the Tantahuatay mine, partially offset by, · $57.8 million of higher capitalized interest which decreased non-operating expense due to increased capital expenditures at our Mexican operations. 2013-2012: Non-operating income and expense were a net expense of $159.5 million in 2013 compared to a net expense of $135.4 million in 2012. The $24.1 million increase in 2013 was a net expense mainly due to: · $63.7 million of higher interest expense as a result of the $1.5 billion notes issued in November 2012, · $18.2 million less of a 2012 gain in the sale of our shares of Compania Internacional Minera, a mining company in which we had a minority participation, partially offset by · $39.5 million of higher capitalized interest due to increased capital expenditures principally at our Mexican operations, and · $18.4 million received in 2013 from Coimolache as a return of funds provided during the exploration stage of the Tantahuatay mine. These funds were originally expensed on our financial statements. Income taxes 2014 2013 2012 Provision for income taxes $ 754.6 $ 769.3 $ 1,080.9 Effective income tax rate 36.5 % 32.4 % 36.3 % The income tax provision includes Peruvian, Mexican and U.S. federal and state income taxes. 77 Table of Contents Components of income tax provision for 2014, 2013 and 2012 include the following ($ in million): 2014 2013 2012 Statutory income tax provision $ 630.6 $ 743.8 $ 1,031.3 Peruvian royalty 7.5 — — Mexican royalty 81.2 — — Peruvian special mining tax 35.3 25.5 49.6 Total income tax provision $ 754.6 $ 769.3 $ 1,080.9 The increase in the effective tax rate in 2014 from the prior year is primarily due to the new Mexican royalty tax instituted for 2014, which added 4.0% to the effective tax rate and the provision for environmental remediation, which is a non-deductible expense. The higher effective income tax rate in 2012 was principally due to a $316.2 million one-time payment of legal fees related to the SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit, which is being treated as a non-deductible expense. In 2014, the Peruvian government enacted tax law changes to both the income tax and dividend tax rates that become effective on January 1, 2015. The rate in effect for 2014 was 30%, with a 4.1% dividend tax rate. The new rates are as follows: Year Income Tax Rate Dividend Tax Rate 2015- 2016 28 % 6.8 % 2017- 2018 27 % 8.0 % 2019 and later 26 % 9.3 % The recalculation of the deferred tax liability in the Peruvian jurisdiction using future tax rates did not have a material effect on the deferred tax liability and the Company’s financial statements. In 2013, the Mexican Congress enacted tax law changes that became effective on January 1, 2014. Among other things the law maintains the statutory rate at 30%, eliminating rate decreases scheduled to take effect for 2014 and 2015. In addition, the law has made the tax consolidation rules more restrictive. The impact of these changes increased our deferred income tax provision in 2013 by $34.7 million. Please see Note 7 “Income taxes” for a more complete description of the tax changes. Equity earnings of affiliate In 2014, 2013 and 2012 we have recognized $23.9 million, $20.9 million and $48.7 million, respectively of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2014 was $5.0 million, compared to $5.7 million in 2013, and $6.7 million in 2012, decreases in 2014 and 2013 of $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. These decreases were the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2014 was $1,333.0 million, compared to $1,618.5 million in 2013 and $1,934.6 million in 2012. Net income attributable to SCC decreased mainly as a result of the decrease in metal prices and other factors described above.

Other Liquidity Considerations We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2015 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required. As of December 31, 2014, $37.7 million of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $722.0 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. The Company had provided a deferred tax liability of $7.4 million as of December 31, 2013 for the U.S. income tax effects of $76.2 million of foreign earnings that may potentially be repatriated in the future. At December 31, 2014 Minera Mexico has determined that it has no remittable earnings available for dividends to the United States due to its internal financial obligations and current expansion, and that at the end of 2014 it has met the indefinite reversal criteria of ASC 740-30-25-17 that it intends to reinvest its earnings indefinitely. Any distribution of earnings from our Mexican subsidiaries to the United States is subject to a U.S. federal income tax that equates to approximately 10% of the amount of the distribution after considering foreign tax credit utilization. Distributions of earnings from our Peruvian branch to the United States are not subject to repatriation taxes. Our Peruvian operations are not foreign subsidiaries. Rather they are mainly comprised of operations that are treated as a branch of our U.S. operations from a tax perspective. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our BOD authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2014, we have purchased 79.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1,842.3 million. These shares will be available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - SCC common stock repurchase plan.” Dividend: On January 29, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock payable on March 3, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2015. SCC shareholder derivative lawsuit: On October 9, 2012, we received from AMC, our majority shareholder, $2.1 billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the Court of Chancery of Delaware which concluded that we paid an excessive price to AMC in the 2005 merger between the Company and Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. From the aforementioned sum received from AMC, we paid $316.2 million to the plaintiff’s attorneys to satisfy the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. The effect of these transactions was recorded in our 2012 results. 85 Table of Contents FINANCING In November 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate unsecured notes with a discount of $22.5 million, which is being amortized over the term of the related debt. This debt was issued in two tranches, $300 million due in 2022 at an annual interest rate of 3.5% and $1.2 billion due in 2042 at an annual interest rate of 5.25%. Net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our capital expenditure program. In 2013, World Finance, an international business magazine, recognized this debt as the best international debt issuance of the year in the mining industry. Our total debt at December 31, 2014 was $4,206.0 million, compared to $4,204.9 million at December 31, 2013, net of the unamortized discount of notes issued under par of $45.1 million and $46.2 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 41.8% at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.1% at December 31, 2013. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 39.7% at December 31, 2014, compared to 31.3% at December 31, 2013. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt can we take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” below. Please see Note 10 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital expenditures from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014: Payments due by Period Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 4,251.1 $ 200.0 — — — — $ 4,051.1 Interest on debt 5,443.0 256.4 $ 248.9 $ 248.9 $ 249.0 $ 249.0 4,190.8 Uncertain tax position(a) 319.4 — — — — — — Workers’ participation 200.3 200.3 — — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 40.5 8.2 2.6 2.5 2.7 2.9 21.6 Asset retirement obligation 116.1 13.7 — — — — 102.4 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 9,749.5 509.7 537.1 492.9 454.8 472.4 7,282.7 Capital expenditure projects 590.1 523.0 67.1 — — — — Total $ 20,710.0 $ 1,711.3 $ 855.7 $ 744.3 $ 706.5 $ 724.3 $ 15,648.6 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2014 the liability recognized by the Company is $319.4 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet. 86 Table of Contents Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account of $45.1 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2014. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 11 “Benefit Plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 9 “Asset Retirement Obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. In June 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with the state company Electroperu S.A., which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2037. Also in July 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa, which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2027. Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies — Other commitments.” Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital expenditure projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine. 87 Table of Contents NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 69) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below: 2014 2013 2012 $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) $ 2,840.5 $ 1.96 $ 2,871.3 $ 2.15 $ 2,769.2 $ 2.01 Add: Selling, general and administrative 103.4 0.07 102.5 0.08 101.3 0.08 Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges (44.2 ) (0.03 ) (36.9 ) (0.03 ) (8.8 ) (0.01 ) Less: Workers’ participation (204.4 ) (0.14 ) (226.5 ) (0.17 ) (268.6 ) (0.19 ) Cost of metals purchased from third parties (161.7 ) (0.11 ) (203.0 ) (0.15 ) (241.9 ) (0.18 ) Royalty charge and other, net (15.0 ) (0.01 ) (88.9 ) (0.07 ) (123.8 ) (0.09 ) Inventory change 226.4 0.15 122.9 0.09 148.8 0.11 Operating Cash Cost without by-product revenues $ 2,745.0 $ 1.89 $ 2,541.4 $ 1.90 $ 2,376.2 $ 1.73 Add: By-product revenues (1) (1,202.6 ) (0.83 ) (1,189.5 ) (0.89 ) (1,386.5 ) (1.01 ) Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties (10.1 ) (0.01 ) (17.9 ) (0.01 ) (18.8 ) (0.01 ) Add: Total by-product revenues (1,212.7 ) (0.84 ) (1,207.4 ) (0.90 ) (1,405.3 ) (1.02 ) Operating Cash Cost with by-product revenues $ 1,532.3 $ 1.05 $ 1,334.0 $ 1.00 $ 970.9 $ 0.71 Total pounds of copper produced (in millions) 1,453.2 1,338.8 1,377.4 (1) By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following: 2014 2013 2012 $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound $ million $ per pound Molybdenum $ (506.9 ) (0.35 ) $ (388.2 ) (0.29 ) $ (450.4 ) (0.33 ) Silver (239.4 ) (0.17 ) (305.8 ) (0.23 ) (381.4 ) (0.28 ) Zinc (209.8 ) (0.14 ) (202.3 ) (0.15 ) (196.1 ) (0.14 ) Sulfuric Acid (121.5 ) (0.08 ) (154.5 ) (0.12 ) (210.9 ) (0.15 ) Gold (41.3 ) (0.03 ) (51.1 ) (0.04 ) (60.8 ) (0.04 ) Other products (83.7 ) (0.06 ) (87.6 ) (0.06 ) (86.9 ) (0.07 ) Total $ (1,202.6 ) (0.83 ) $ (1,189.5 ) (0.89 ) $ (1,386.5 ) (1.01 ) The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 137 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties. 88 Table of Contents Net debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: 2014 2013 Total debt $ 4,206.0 $ 4,204.9 Cash and cash equivalent balance (364.0 ) (1,672.7 ) Net debt 3,842.0 2,532.2 Net capitalization: Net debt 3,842.0 2,532.2 Equity 5,836.6 5,561.8 Net capitalization $ 9,678.6 $ 8,094.0 Net debt/net capitalization (*) 39.7 % 31.3 % (*) Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. For 2015, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged, giving no effects to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.0 Annual change in net income attributable to SCC (in millions) $ 99.3 $ 27.8 $ 12.7 $ 7.5 Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper and molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. Following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at December 31, 2014: Sales volume (million lbs.) Priced at (per pound) Month of settlement Copper 7.4 2.873 From January 2015 to April 2015 Molybdenum 11.7 9.00 From January 2015 to March 2015 Provisional sales price adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at December, 31, 2014 were $(9.6) million for copper and $(16.5) million for molybdenum Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian nuevos soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the nuevo sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 3.2 % 2.9 % 2.6 % Initial exchange rate 2.796 2.551 2.697 Closing exchange rate 2.989 2.796 2.551 Appreciation/(devaluation) (6.9 )% (9.6 )% 5.4 % Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 4.1 % 4.0 % 3.6 % Initial exchange rate 13.077 13.010 13.979 Closing exchange rate 14.718 13.077 13.010 Appreciation/(devaluation) (12.6 )% (0.5 )% 6.9 % 90 Table of Contents Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2014, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian nuevo sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ 11.0 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. nuevo sol $ (12.9 ) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 23.5 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (28.8 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are nuevo sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2014.

1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” the” Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business - Cautionary Statement.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. In 2015, we invested $1,250.0 million in capital programs, including the $100.4 million El Pilar acquisition, along with $48.8 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate. We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2015, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, totaled 70.1 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations: Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 33,275 Peruvian operations 24,767 IMMSA 218 Development projects 11,843 Total 70,103 Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following: · Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2015, the average LME copper price was $2.50 per pound and the average COMEX copper price was $2.51 per pound, about 19.6% lower than in 2014. In 2015, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $2.05 to $2.92. Average molybdenum, zinc and silver prices decreased in 2015 by, 41.7%, 10.2% and 17.6%, respectively, compared to 2014. · Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 78% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 7% from molybdenum, 5% from silver, 4% from zinc and 6% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials. · Copper: Regarding the copper market, we maintain our long term confidence in the positive fundamentals of this market. During last year, demand was affected by macroeconomic headwinds, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank interest rate increase and the 63 Table of Contents effect of the sharp decline in oil prices, as well as concerns about the Chinese economy’s copper consumption and the market balance. China is the world’s major copper consumer with about 46% of world consumption. We believe China’s demand for copper will increase 3.5% in 2016, led by the partial recovery of the Chinese housing market and a speeding up of their national grid investment program. On a longer term view, we want to emphasize that China is an emerging market and as such, their middle class is hungry for housing, cars, appliances and other consumer goods. So we believe we will see a strong copper demand coming from this country in the future, as it will evolve towards a consumption driven economy. Additionally, we believe that demand for copper from developed economies such as United States, Europe and Japan, will be positive and we expect an increase of about 1.5%. These economies represent about 30% of worldwide refined copper demand. On the supply side, we have noted production cut announcements in 2015 of about 600,000 tons and we expect these cuts to materialize, as well as some additional production cuts if this price environment persists. On a more structural view, as we have expressed in the past, we believe that supply will be affected in the coming quarters from delays in project startups, technical problems, labor unrest, excess government taxation and other difficulties. We do not see the physical market under pressure. Inventories have trended consistently down after the second quarter of 2015. At its peak in April 2015, the sum of inventories at the LME, Comex and Shanghai warehouses was 612,561 tons. At December 31, 2015, this sum was 478,262 tons lower by 22% from the 2015 peak. Current copper inventories at the warehouses are approximately equal to 8 days of worldwide annual refined copper consumption. Finally, we want to emphasize that copper prices at current levels are not sufficient to promote the necessary future supply growth to meet future market needs. Thus, we believe that current market circumstances are improving the strong long-term fundamentals of our industry. In 2015, we produced 742,993 tons of copper, a new production record. This allowed us to increase 2015´s copper sales volume by 12.3%. The additional copper units have a very low cost per pound improving our overall cash cost and competitiveness. For 2016, we expect to have a new copper production record of 903,300 tons of copper, an increase of 160,300 tons or a 21.6% production growth. · Molybdenum: This metal represented 4.7% of the Company sales in 2015. In 2015 we saw a molybdenum price deterioration consistent with our outlook for more supply growth coming from our Buenavista operation as well as from Sierra Gorda, Toromocho and Caserones, among other projects. Demand for molybdenum was weak in 2015 and will be affected in 2016 by lower expected consumption for special alloys coming from the oil drilling industry. Even though the current scenario for molybdenum prices is not positive, it is important to note that we have already had two quarters with market deficits in molybdenum. This has given support to its market price at a level slightly higher than $5.00 dollars per pound. Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. · Silver: Regarding this metal, we believe that prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.5% of our sales in 2015. · Zinc: Zinc has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns. In the last 12 months zinc inventories have consistently decreased, improving this market’s fundamentals. We are expecting an increasing price scenario for zinc in the next few years. Zinc represented 4.2% of our sales in 2015. · Production: For 2016, improvements in operational practices, exchange rate depreciation where we operate, lower fuel costs and capital investments will reduce unit costs and increase our copper and molybdenum production. We plan to increase our copper production to 903,300 tons, which is 160,307 tons (21.6%) higher than 2015 production of 742,993 tons. In the 2015-16 two-year period, we will have increased copper production by 225,000 tons. 64 Table of Contents We expect to produce 21,800 tons of molybdenum, lower by 6.6% from last year’s production of 23,347 tons. Additionally, we expect to produce 16.0 million ounces of silver, about 20.3% higher than the 2015 production of 13.3 million ounces due to higher IMMSA production. Regarding zinc production, for 2016 we expect to produce 86,900 tons of zinc from our mines, 40.4% higher than 2015’s production, mainly due to the recovery of the Santa Eulalia mine, whose production was affected by a flood in 2015 and from higher Charcas mine production. · Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three-years ended December 2015 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Operating costs and expenses (in millions) $ 3,631.5 $ 3,555.0 $ 3,420.8 Percentage increase from prior year 2.2 % 3.9 % 5.5 % Operating costs and expenses in 2015 increased $76.5 million, compared to 2014, principally due to higher production, which lead to higher costs of sales and due to higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our operations; partially offset by lower environmental remediation and exploration expense. Operating costs and expenses in 2014 increased $134.2 million, compared to 2013, principally due to higher production, a $91.4 million environmental remediation provision for the spill at Buenavista, higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our operations and higher exploration spending. · Capital investments: Capital investments were $1,250.0 million for 2015, including the El Pilar acquisition in Sonora, Mexico. This is 18.3% lower than in 2014, and represented 169.7% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. In addition, the Buenavista expansion program is largely completed. For 2016, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,577.8 million to make the final payments for the Buenavista projects, to initiate the construction of a new concentrator in Toquepala, with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons of copper and 3,100 tons of molybdenum, and for the Tia Maria project. With these projects we are continuing our investment program to increase copper production capacity by more than 90% from our 2013 production level of 617,000 tons to 1.2 million tons by 2018. KEY MATTERS We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts): Variance 2015 2014 2013 2015-2014 2014-2013 Net sales $ 5,045.9 $ 5,787.7 $ 5,952.9 $ (741.8 ) $ (165.2 ) Operating income $ 1,414.4 $ 2,232.7 $ 2,532.1 $ (818.3 ) $ (299.4 ) Net income attributable to SCC $ 736.4 $ 1,333.0 $ 1,618.5 $ (596.6 ) $ (285.5 ) Earnings per share $ 0.93 $ 1.61 $ 1.92 $ (0.68 ) $ (0.31 ) Dividends per share $ 0.34 $ 0.46 $ 0.68 $ (0.12 ) $ (0.22 ) Pounds of copper sold 1,625.8 1,448.0 1,382.4 177.8 65.6 Net sales decreased in the three-year period from 2013 to 2015, due to lower metal prices for copper, molybdenum and silver, partially offset by an increase in copper sales volume. The 2015 copper sales volume increased by 12.3%. The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2015, cost of sales increased by $87.1 million and depreciation, 65 Table of Contents amortization and depletion increased by $65.7 million. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher production, as well as higher cost of metals purchased from third parties, net foreign currency transaction effect and higher sales volume; partially offset by lower fuel and power costs, workers’ participation expense, labor costs, and sales expenses. The increase in depreciation was mainly due to investment and maintenance capital acquisitions at most of our operations. In addition, the 2014 operating costs include a $91.4 million charge for costs of remediating the spill at Buenavista, in 2015, this cost was $45.0 million. Net income attributable to SCC in 2015 was 44.8% lower mainly due to the above noted factors. Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2015: Variance (million pounds, except silver — 2015-2014 2014-2013 million ounces) 2015 2014 2013 Volume % Volume % Copper 1,638.0 1,491.6 1,360.3 146.4 9.8 % 131.3 9.7 % Molybdenum 51.5 51.0 43.9 0.5 1.0 % 7.1 16.2 % Zinc 136.5 146.9 219.1 (10.4 ) (7.1 )% (72.2 ) (33.0 )% Silver 13.3 13.0 13.5 0.3 2.3 % (0.5 ) (3.9 )% The tables below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2015: Variance Copper 2015-2014 2014-2013 (in million pounds): 2015 2014 2013 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 316.6 309.7 306.6 6.9 2.2 % 3.1 1.0 % Cuajone 392.8 393.2 371.7 (0.4 ) (0.1 )% 21.5 5.8 % La Caridad 288.9 278.4 266.2 10.5 3.8 % 12.2 4.6 % Buenavista 627.4 498.8 401.7 128.6 25.8 % 97.1 24.2 % IMMSA 12.3 11.5 14.1 0.8 7.3 % (2.6 ) (18.7 )% Total mined copper 1,638.0 1,491.6 1,360.3 146.4 9.8 % 131.3 9.7 % 2015 compared to 2014: Mined copper in 2015 increased 146.4 million pounds, compared to 2014 production. This increase was due to: · Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to higher throughput at the concentrator and better ore grades, as well as higher production from the SX-EW III plant. · Higher production at the Toquepala mine and La Caridad mine due to better ore grades and recoveries. · Higher production at the IMMSA mines due to higher throughput at the concentrators, slightly reduced by · Lower production at the Cuajone mine due to lower ore grades. Molybdenum production increased 0.5 million pounds in 2015, compared to 2014, and silver production increased 0.3 million ounces in 2015. Zinc production decreased by 10.4 million pounds in 2015, continuing the slide seen in the prior year. We expect zinc production to increase in 2016 as production problems at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines have been resolved. 2014 compared to 2013: Mined copper in 2014 increased 131.3 million pounds, compared to 2013 production. This increase was due to: · Higher production at our Buenavista mine due to higher throughput at the concentrator and better ore grades and recoveries, as well as higher production from the SX-EW III plant. · Higher production at the Toquepala mine and La Caridad mine due to better ore grades and recoveries. · Higher production at the Cuajone mine resulting from higher ore grades and increased throughput from the HPGR production process, slightly reduced by · Lower production at IMMSA mines due to problems at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines; an accident occurred at the Charcas mine that temporarily restricted production while the Santa Eulalia mine experienced flooding problems. 66 Table of Contents Molybdenum production increased 7.1 million pounds in 2014, compared to 2013, mainly at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines. Zinc mine production decreased by 72.2 million pounds in 2014, 33.0% lower than in 2013, mainly as a result of lower grades at all our IMMSA mines and lower production at the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines, as discussed above. Our silver production decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 production due to lower production at the IMMSA mines offset by higher production at the Toquepala, Cuajone, Buenavista and La Caridad mines. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation”, beginning on page 85. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both without and with the inclusion of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced with by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, with by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs, without by-product revenues allows us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern as copper is our main source of revenues. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper with by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allow us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2015: 67 Table of Contents Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced (1) (In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) Variance 2015-2014 2014-2013 2015 2014 2013 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost without by-product revenues $ 2,643.9 $ 2,739.3 $ 2,541.4 $ (95.4 ) (3.5 )% $ 197.9 7.8 % Total by-product revenues (866.8 ) (1,186.4 ) (1,207.4 ) 319.6 26.9 % 21.0 1.7 % Total operating cash cost with by-product revenues $ 1,777.1 $ 1,552.9 $ 1,334.0 $ 224.2 14.4 % $ 218.9 16.4 % Total pounds of copper produced (2) 1,589.5 1,453.2 1,338.8 136.3 9.4 % 114.4 8.5 % Operating cash cost per pound without by-product revenues 1.66 1.89 1.90 (0.23 ) (11.8 )% (0.01 ) (0.5 )% Operating cash cost per pound with by-product revenues 1.12 1.07 1.00 0.05 4.6 % 0.07 7.0 % (1) These are non-GAAP measures, see page 85 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. (2) Net of metallurgical losses. 2015 compared to 2014: As seen on the chart above, our 2015 operating cash cost per pound of copper without by-product revenues was $0.23 per pound lower than in 2014, a decrease of 11.8%. This was due to lower costs per pound from production costs, as a result of higher production, lower labor expenses, fuel and power costs; and lower costs per pound from selling, general and administrative expenses and capitalized leachable material included in cost of sales, partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges and premium. Our cash cost per pound for 2015 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.12 per pound, compared to $1.07 per pound in 2014, an increase of 4.6%. This was due to lower credits of our by-products, mainly because of lower prices. 2014 compared to 2013: As seen on the chart above, our 2014 operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by-product revenues was slightly lower than in 2013, a decrease of 0.5% mainly due to the diluting effect on unit cost of higher production at all our open pit mines, most significantly from Buenavista. This increase in production volume offset the cost of higher inflation, which increased fuel, power and other operating materials for our production process. Our cash cost per pound for 2014 when calculated with by-product revenues was $1.05 per pound, compared to $1.00 per pound in 2013. The by-product credit in 2014 was six cents less than in 2013. This was due to lower prices for silver and gold, and lower sales volume of silver and zinc. Higher prices for zinc and molybdenum and higher sales volume for molybdenum and gold helped to offset some of the negative factors. Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments. For 2016, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: 68 Table of Contents Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver — per ounce) $ 0.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.10 $ 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) $ 115.8 $ 28.1 $ 13.2 $ 9.7 Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities. Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 18 “Segment and Related Information” of our consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information. Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $1,250.0 million in 2015, including the El Pilar acquisition, $1,534.8 million and $1,703.3 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. The table below sets forth our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions): Peruvian projects: 2015 2014 2013 Cuajone projects $ 0.8 $ 7.0 $ 9.6 Cuajone mine south area stability program — 10.6 59.4 HPGR system —Toquepala 5.6 — — Ilo 3 power sub-station 6.5 4.4 5.9 In-pit crushing and conveyor (IPCC) Project 50.0 31.3 2.7 New business planning system 4.5 10.2 0.5 Replacement of tailing thickeners — Cuajone 1.3 — — Tailings disposal — Quebrada Honda dam 0.7 2.9 0.9 Tia Maria — Arequipa 7.9 8.5 41.1 Toquepala projects 56.5 65.7 56.7 Sub-total projects 133.8 140.6 176.8 Maintenance and replacement 188.5 213.2 195.5 Capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid (37.1 ) — — Total Peruvian expenditures 285.2 353.8 372.3 Mexican projects: Buenavista mine expansion — 6.7 167.9 New Buenavista concentrator 238.4 465.2 388.3 Buenavista projects infrastructure 89.6 65.8 39.0 Buenavista SX-EW plant III 11.0 175.8 226.7 Buenavista crusher and conveyors system for leach material (Quebalix III) — — 8.1 Quebalix IV 99.4 70.4 54.0 Buenavista molybdenum plant — — 19.0 El Arco feasibility study, land and water rights — 0.9 1.3 La Caridad flash furnace and acid plant modernization 2.8 23.2 39.5 Santa Eulalia pumping system — — 1.8 New system recovery solutions 14.9 66.2 42.4 Other projects 169.8 61.3 46.2 Sub-total projects 625.9 935.5 1,034.2 Maintenance and replacement 216.9 235.8 287.8 Capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid 19.8 (5.0 ) — Total Mexican expenditures 862.6 1,166.3 1,322.0 Other projects: El Pilar mine 100.4 — — Angangueo Project 1.8 9.7 9.0 Total other projects 102.2 9.7 9.0 Total capital investments $ 1,250.0 $ 1,529.8 $ 1,703.3 69 Table of Contents In 2016, we plan to invest $1,577.8 million in capital projects. Our investment program aims to increase copper production capacity by approximately 90% from our 2013 production level of 617,000 tons to 1.2 million tons by 2018. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following: Projects in Mexico: Buenavista Projects: We continue developing our $3.5 billion investment program at this unit where we have already invested $3.0 billion. Excluding the Quebalix project and some infrastructure facilities, all the other facilities of this program are currently operating and we are expecting to produce 460,000 tons of copper in 2016 and 500,000 tons in 2017. The Buenavista program is being completed under budget and with practically no execution risk. The new copper-molybdenum concentrator has an annual production capacity of 188,000 tons of copper and 2,600 tons of molybdenum. The project will additionally produce 2.3 million ounces of silver and 21,000 ounces of gold per year. The new concentrator is in its ramping-up phase with five out of the six mills already in operation and the other, in the commissioning process. In September 2015, we obtained the first copper concentrate lot and the plant is now running at 90% capacity. Due to the promising initial results, we expect to gradually increase production until the plant reaches full capacity by the second quarter of 2016. The total capital budget of the project is $1,383.6 million and through December 31, 2015, the project has a 99% progress with an investment of $1,162.0 million. Regarding the mine equipment acquisition for the Buenavista expansion, through December 31, 2015 we have invested $510.9 million and have received sixty-one 400-ton capacity trucks, seven shovels and eight drills required for the mine expansion. All of this equipment is currently in operation. Regarding the SX-EW III plant, in July 2015, the Mexican authorities approved the initiation of activities for the Tinajas 1 leaching pad. This will allow us to achieve the designed annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of low cost copper cathodes by the first quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we have invested $526.4 million. The crushing, conveying and spreading system for leachable ore project (Quebalix IV) will increase production by improving SX-EW copper recovery, reducing processing time and mining and hauling costs. The project has a crushing and conveying capacity of 80 million tons of ore per year and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the project has an 87% progress with an investment of $209 million out of the approved capital budget of $340 million. The remaining projects to complete the $3.5 billion budgeted program include investments in infrastructure, including power lines and substations, water supply, tailings dam, mine equipment shops, internal roads and others. Projects in Peru: Toquepala Projects: Through December 31, 2015, we have invested $392.0 million in the Toquepala concentrator expansion projects. On April 14, 2015 the construction permit for the project was approved, allowing us to continue its development. We had previously received the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) confirming that our project complies with the highest environmental standards of the Peruvian authorities, which corroborates our position as a sustainable company. Once in operation, the Toquepala expansion will increase annual production capacity by 100,000 tons of copper to 235,000 tons in 2018, and will also increase annual molybdenum production by 3,100 tons at an estimated capital cost of $1.2 billion. It is 70 Table of Contents estimated that the project will generate 2,200 jobs during the construction phase and 300 additional jobs once finished, which will add to current 1,500 permanent employees at Toquepala. The project is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2018. The project to improve the crushing process at Toquepala with the installation of a High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) system, which will act as a quaternary crusher, has as its main objective, to ensure that the concentrator will operate at its maximum capacity of 60,000 tons per day, even with an increase of the ore material hardness index. Additionally, recoveries will be improved with a better ore crushing. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated the project engineering and the procurement process. Meanwhile, we will start the planning process for the dismantling of certain structures to provide adequate plant space. The budget approved for this project is $40 million and as of December 31, 2015, we have invested $5.5 million in this project. We expect that it will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017. Cuajone Projects: The In-Pit Crushing and Conveyor (IPCC) Project consists of installing a primary crusher at the mine pit with a conveyor system for moving the ore to the concentrator. The purpose of this project is to optimize the hauling process by replacing rail haulage, thereby reducing operating and maintenance costs as well as the environmental impact of the Cuajone mine. The crusher will have a processing capacity of 43.8 million tons per year. We are completing the detailed engineering. The main components including the crusher and the overland belt have been acquired and we have started the preparation of the land and civil works. As of December 31, 2015, we have invested $80.1 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $165.5 million. The project is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2017. The project to replace tailing thickeners at the concentrator will replace two of the three existing thickeners with a new hi-rate thickener. The purpose is to streamline the concentrator flotation process and improve water recovery efficiency, increasing the tailings solids content from 54% to 61%, thereby reducing fresh water consumption by replacing it with recovered water. As of December 31, 2015, we finalized the commercial negotiations and started the engineering and procurement process. We have invested $1.3 million in this project out of the approved capital budget of $30 million, and we expect it to be completed by the first quarter of 2017. Tia Maria project: While we have received approval of Tia Maria´s EIA, the issuance of the project´s construction permit has been delayed by the Peruvian authorities due to certain pressures from anti-mining groups. The Peruvian government has recommended a dialogue roundtable for the resolution of these differences. The Company has established a multi-faceted encounter plan to explain the merits of the Tia Maria project. A national media campaign was launched in May and, after it, the Company conducted a door-to-door campaign in the neighboring district of Cocachacra. This campaign had the purpose of explaining the relevant environmental topics of the project that concerned the local community, as the anti-mining groups had wrongfully confused the community with respect to the project’s water source and consumption, as well as to the alleged emissions into the atmosphere. Tia Maria, when completed, will represent an investment of approximately $1.4 billion to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year. This project will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process and consequently, no emissions into the atmosphere are released. The project will only use seawater, transporting this more than 25 kilometers and at 1,000 meters above sea level, constructing a desalinization plant representing an investment of $95 million. In this manner, we guarantee that the Tambo river water resources and the water resources from the wells of the areas will be used solely for farming and human consumption, as it has been done until today. We expect the project to generate 3,500 jobs during the construction phase. When in operation, Tia Maria will directly employ 600 workers and indirectly another 2,000. Through its expected twenty-year life, the project related services will create significant business opportunities in the Arequipa region. Tia Maria has complied with all existing requirements and regulations and therefore the Company trusts that it will soon receive from government authorities the construction licenses and permits required in order to begin construction of this project. Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We are developing the engineering and procurement to improve and increase the dam’s embankment with a new cyclone battery station that will allow us to place more slurry at the dams. The project has a total budgeted cost of $66.0 million with $53.4 million invested through December 31, 2015. 71 Table of Contents Potential projects We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, and environmental concerns, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. El Arco: This is a world class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves over 1.5 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.416% and 0.14 grams of gold per ton. In 2010, we concluded the feasibility study and an investment of $56.4 million was approved for land acquisition required for the project. This project, when developed, is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Through December 31, 2015 we have invested $41.3 million on studies, exploration and land acquisition for the project. In 2015, we are continuing to invest in land acquisition and exploration. In addition, we will begin an engineering study to determine the best way to optimize the investment in the project. Angangueo: With an estimated investment of $174.7 million, Angangueo will include a concentrator plant with an estimated average annual production of 10,400 tons of copper and 7,000 tons of zinc in the first seven years. Over the life of the mine, average annual concentrate production is expected to contain 2.4 million ounces of silver and 1,500 ounces of gold. Through December 31, 2015, we have invested $27.4 million on the project. The project is on hold waiting for the environmental permits. The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, leachable material and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $9.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term. However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2015: 2015 2014 2013 Average 2015-2013 Copper ($ per pound) 2.51 3.12 3.34 2.99 Molybdenum ($ per pound) 6.59 11.30 10.26 9.38 72 Table of Contents Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices), for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 “Properties - caption Ore reserves.” Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Through the third quarter of 2014, the cost attributed to the produced leach material was charged to cost of sales over a five-year period, which was the average estimated recovery period based on the recovery percentages of each mine. However, the improvements in efficiency in production and use of leachable material, as a result of the completion of construction of a new plant during the fourth quarter of 2014, resulted in a change in amortization of leachable material to the units of production method. This was accounted for prospectively in 2014 and will better match costs with revenues resulting from the increases in production stemming from the new plant. As the plant entered into operation in the fourth quarter of 2014, the impact to results in 2014 was not considered significant and totaled approximately $17 million recognized within cost of sales. The Company expects that the impacts in future periods will be significant as a result of the increased production levels, which can be seen in the increased production in Buenavista due to the new SX-EW III plant. Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7). Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense. 73 Table of Contents Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Taxes” to record these liabilities. (See Note 8 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, reflective of what the Company believes is the lower level of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $1.75 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.90 to 4.90 times such carrying amount. In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value.

Equity earnings of affiliate In 2015, 2014 and 2013 we have recognized $16.8 million, $23.9 million and $20.9 million, respectively of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine. Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2015 was $4.7 million, compared to $4.9 million in 2014, and $5.7 million in 2013, decreases in 2015 and 2014 of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. These decreases were the result of lower earnings at our Peruvian operations. Income attributable to SCC Our net income attributable to SCC in 2015 was $736.4 million, compared to $1,333.0 million in 2014 and $1,618.5 million in 2013. Net income attributable to SCC decreased mainly as a result of the decrease in metal prices and other factors described above.

At December 31, 2015, and 2014, our Mexican subsidiary has determined that it has no remittable earnings available for dividends to the United States due to its internal financial obligations and current expansion, and that at the end of 2015 it has met the indefinite reversal criteria of ASC 740-30-25-17 that it intends to reinvest its earnings indefinitely. Any distribution of earnings from our Mexican subsidiaries to the United States is subject to a U.S. federal income tax that equates to approximately 10% of the amount of the distribution after considering foreign tax credit utilization. Distributions of earnings from our Peruvian branch to the United States are not subject to repatriation taxes. Our Peruvian operations are not foreign subsidiaries. Rather they are mainly comprised of operations that are treated as a branch of our U.S. operations from a tax perspective. Share repurchase program: In 2008, our BOD authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2015, we have purchased 116.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.8 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - SCC common stock repurchase plan.” Dividend: On January 28, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.03 per share of common stock payable on March 1, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016. FINANCING Our total debt at December 31, 2015 was $5,951.5 million, compared to $4,180.9 million at December 31, 2014, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par of $99.6 million and $70.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.89%. On April 20, 2015, we issued $2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. This debt was issued in two tranches, $500 million due 2025 at an annual interest rate of 3.875% and $1.5 billion due 2045 at an annual interest rate of 5.875%. These notes will be general unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of the Company´s capital investment program. The notes were issued with an underwriters’ discount of $20.2 million. Additionally, issuance costs of $11.8 million associated with these notes were paid and deferred. The unamortized balance of the discount and the costs are presented net of the carrying value of the debt issued and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the loan. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 52.9 % at December 31, 2015, compared to 41.7% at December 31, 2014. Also the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 48.9% at December 31, 2015, compared to 37.3% at December 31, 2014. We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” below. Please see Note 11 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt. 83 Table of Contents Capital investment programs A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015: Payments due by Period Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 6,051.1 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 400.0 $ 5,651.1 Interest on debt 7,970.3 356.5 356.5 356.5 356.5 341.3 6,203.0 Uncertain tax position(a) 400.0 — — — — — Workers’ participation 124.9 124.9 — — — — Pension and post-retirement obligations 28.8 8.8 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.3 11.2 Asset retirement obligation 190.9 70.7 — — — — 120.2 Purchase obligations: Commitment to purchase energy 6,180.0 455.3 400.1 365.3 367.3 369.2 4,222.8 Capital investment projects 2,225.7 676.7 657.0 677.0 215.0 — — Total $ 23,171.7 $ 1,692.9 $ 1,415.7 $ 1,401.0 $ 941.0 $ 1,112.8 $ 16,208.3 (a) The above table does not include any future payment related to uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2015, the liability recognized by the Company is $400 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $99.6 million. Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2015. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities. Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law. Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit Plans” of our consolidated financial statements. Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation.” We have a commitment to purchase power for our Peruvian operations from Enersur through April 2017. In June 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with the state company Electroperu S.A., which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2037. Also in July 2014, we signed a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa, which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2027. 84 Table of Contents Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies — Other commitments”. Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts principally for our Mexican projects at the Buenavista mine, and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity price risk: For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to “Metal Prices” in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 18 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales. Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2015, are provided in the table below: 2015 2014 2013 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 4.4 % 3.2 % 2.9 % Initial exchange rate 2.989 2.796 2.551 Closing exchange rate 3.413 2.989 2.796 Appreciation/(devaluation) (14.2 )% (6.9 )% (9.6 )% Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 2.1 % 4.1 % 4.0 % Initial exchange rate 14.718 13.077 13.010 Closing exchange rate 17.207 14.718 13.077 Appreciation/(devaluation) (16.9 )% (12.6 )% (0.5 )% Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2015, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: Effect in net earnings ($ in millions) Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ (2.2 ) Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol $ 2.3 Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ 2.7 Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso $ (3.3 ) The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2015.

1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2020,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” “Southern Copper,” “the Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results.​This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business—Cautionary Statement.”​EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW​Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices.​We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico.​Net sales in 2019 were $7.3 billion, the highest amount in Southern Copper history.​In 2019, we invested $707.5 million in capital programs, along with $30.0 million in our exploration efforts. We believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our Company, our investors, our neighboring communities, and the countries in which we operate.​We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. At December 31, 2019, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $2.90 per pound, totaled 67.6 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations:​​​​Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tonsMexican open‑pit 31,004Peruvian operations 21,718IMMSA 248Development projects 14,604Total 67,574​Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following:​●Changes in copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc prices: In 2019, the average LME and COMEX per pound copper prices were $2.72, approximately 8.1% and 7.2% lower than 2018, respectively. In 2019, per pound LME spot copper prices ranged from $2.51 to $2.98. The average silver price increased by 3.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. Average molybdenum and zinc prices decreased in 2019 by 5.0% and 12.8%, respectively, compared to 2018. 66 Table of Contents●Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 81.0% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 6.7% from molybdenum, 4.4% from zinc, 4.3% from silver and 3.6% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials.​●Copper: During the last quarter of 2019, the LME copper price decreased, from an average of $2.80 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $2.67(-4.6%). As of today, we are seeing prices in the range of $2.55-$2.60 per pound as a reflection of the worldwide concern regarding the effect of COVID-19 disease, also known as Coronavirus. The world is now starting to feel the financial and economic impacts from the outbreak but at this point, it is difficult to assess the full effect of this event on copper demand. However, we hope that the outbreak, if timely contained, would have a milder impact on the global economy ending in a V shape recovery for copper demand.​For supply, we maintain our view of it growing at 2.0% to 2.5% for this year, contingent of not being affected significantly by the disease. Consequently, we expect a mild copper market surplus for this year.​●Molybdenum: It represented approximately 7.6% of our sales in 2019. Molybdenum prices averaged $11.27 per pound in 2019, compared to $11.86 in 2018, a 4.9% decrease.​Molybdenum is mainly used for the production of special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production.​●Zinc: It has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and the expected production. Zinc represented 3.8% of our sales in 2019.​●Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.5% of our sales in 2019.​●Production: In the second quarter of 2019, we reached full production at the new Toquepala concentrator which produced 101,738 tons of copper in 2019. For 2020, we expect to produce 998,400 tons of copper, in line with the 993,822 tons we produced in 2019.​We also expect to produce 23.7 million ounces of silver, about 16% higher than the 2019 production of 20.3 million ounces mainly resulting from the important contribution of the San Martin and Santa Barbara operations of IMMSA. In 2020, we expect to produce 80,600 tons of zinc from our mines, up 9% from 2019 production of 73,922 tons, as result of the recovery of production at the San Martin mine. Additionally, we expect to produce 26,700 tons of molybdenum, in line with 2019 production of 26,885 tons.​●Cost: Our operating costs and expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2019 have increased in total in each of the years. Our comparison of costs for the three year period is as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​ ​ Variance ​​2019 2018 2017 Value %​Operating costs and expenses (in millions)​$ 4,532.6​$ 4,215.5​$ 4,035.6​$ 317.1​​ 7.5%​Operating costs and expenses in 2019 increased $317.1 million, compared to 2018, mainly due to higher cost of sales in all our operating segments, as well as higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Peruvian operations due to the completion of the Toquepala expansion project.​Operating costs and expenses in 2018 increased $179.9 million, compared to 2017, mainly due to higher cost of sales in all our operating segments, as well as higher depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Mexican operations. This was partially offset by lower depreciation, amortization and depletion at our Peruvian operations, lower exploration expenses and a $10.2 million credit related to a previously accrued environmental remediation cost at our Mexican operations which was reversed in the first quarter of 2017.​67 Table of Contents●Capital investments: Capital investments were $707.5 million for 2019. This is 36.9% lower than in 2018, and represented 47.0% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our copper volume production to 1.5 million tons by 2028 with the development of new projects.​For 2020, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,146.7 million.​KEY MATTERS​We discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program.​Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2019 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​ ​ Variance​​2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017Copper price LME​​ 2.72​​ 2.96​​ 2.80​​ (0.24) ​ 0.16Pounds of copper sold​​ 2,173.8​​ 1,952.9​​ 1,959.2​​ 220.9 ​ (6.3)Net sales​$ 7,285.6​$ 7,096.7​$ 6,654.5​$ 188.9​$ 442.2Operating income​$ 2,753.0​$ 2,881.2​$ 2,618.9​$ (128.2)​$ 262.3Income before income taxes​$ 2,426.5​$ 2,589.4​$ 2,302.7​$ (162.9)​$ 286.7Net income attributable to SCC​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,543.0​$ 728.5​$ (57.2)​$ 814.5Earnings per share​$ 1.92​$ 2.00​$ 0.94​$ (0.08)​$ 1.06Dividends per share​$ 1.60​$ 1.40​$ 0.59​$ 0.20​$ 0.81​Net sales in 2019 of $7.3 billion were the highest in our history and were higher than in 2018 by $188.9 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+11.3%), molybdenum (+21.7%) and silver (+5.7%) sales volumes, partially offset by lower copper (−8.1%) and molybdenum (−5.0%) prices. Net sales in 2018 were higher than in 2017 by $442.2 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+5.7%) and molybdenum (+45.9%) prices and higher sales volumes of silver (+15.3%) and molybdenum (+3.3%), partially offset by lower silver prices (−8.1%) and lower zinc sales volume (−1.0%).​The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods above. In 2019, cost of sales increased by $197.4 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $90.1 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2019 was mainly due to higher repairing materials and operating contractors’ costs, as well as lower capitalized leachable material. This was partially offset by a lower cost of metals purchased from third parties. In 2018, cost of sales increased by $156.2 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $3.2 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2018 was mainly due to higher fuel costs, higher workers’ participation expense and inventory consumption.​Despite the higher sales volumes reported at competitive costs, net income attributable to SCC in 2019 was 3.6% lower than in 2018 mainly due to lower prices for copper and molybdenum, as mentioned previously. Net income attributable to SCC in 2018 was 111.8% higher than in 2017 mainly due to the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million recorded in 2017 as result of the U.S. income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 7 “Income Taxes”, of our consolidated financial statements.​Production: The table below highlights, mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2019:68 Table of Contents​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2019 - 2018​2018 - 2017 ​​2019 2018 2017 Volume %​Volume % Copper (in million pounds) 2,191.0 1,948.2 1,933.4 242.8 12.5% 14.8 0.8%Molybdenum (in million pounds) 59.3 48.5 47.0 10.8 22.3% 1.5 3.2%Zinc (in million pounds) 163.0 156.0 151.4 7.0 4.4% 4.6 3.0%Silver (in million ounces) 20.3 17.3 15.9 3.0 17.1% 1.4 8.8%​The table below highlights copper production data at each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2019 - 20182018 - 2017 Copper (in million pounds):​2019 2018 2017 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 568.8 375.4 326.4 193.4 51.5% 49.0 15.0%Cuajone 344.8 354.0 348.5 (9.2) (2.6)% 5.5 1.6%La Caridad 293.4 292.1 296.9 1.3 0.4% (4.8) (1.6)%Buenavista 965.8 913.0 949.5 52.8 5.8% (36.5) (3.8)%IMMSA 18.2 13.7 12.1 4.5 32.9% 1.6 13.2%Total mined copper 2,191.0 1,948.2 1,933.4 242.8 12.5% 14.8 0.8%​2019 compared to 2018:​Copper mine production in 2019 increased 12.5% to 2,191.0 million pounds from 1,948.2 million pounds in 2018. This increase was due to:​●Higher production at the Toquepala mine (+51.5%), as a result of additional copper production of 93,108 tons from the successful ramping up of the new concentrator. ●Higher production at the Buenavista mine (+5.8%) due to operating improvements at our new Buenavista plants, the SX/EW (+12.2%) and concentrator (+4.0%).●Higher production at the IMMSA operations (+32.9%), as result of the restoration of the San Martin mine operations.​Molybdenum production increased 22.3% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher production at all of our mines, principally at the Toquepala mine (+75%) due to the successful ramping up of the new molybdenum plant that started production in April 2019.​Zinc production increased 4.4% in 2019, as a result of higher production at our Santa Barbara mine due to higher grades and recoveries, as well as the restored production of 5,837 tons from our San Martin mine.​Mined silver production increased 17.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala (+60.5%), IMMSA (+22.9%) and Buenavista (+11.5%) operations, partially offset by lower production at the La Caridad (-6.6%) and Cuajone (-3.2%) mines.​2018 compared to 2017:​Copper mine production in 2018 increased 0.8% to 1,948.2 million pounds from 1,933.4 million pounds in 2017. This increase was due to:​●Higher production at the Toquepala and Cuajone mines due to higher ore grades and recoveries, which was partially offset by●Lower production at the Buenavista mine due to lower SX-EW copper production (−20.1%). In 2018, the Company initiated a 12-month corrective program to overcome this temporary reduction in production. The program includes depositing the minerals in different leaching pads depending on the characteristics of the ore. Also, the Company 69 Table of Contentshas implemented improvements and controls in the ore fragmentation that occurs in the blasting, to avoid the fine materials that may cause clogging in the recovery process.​Molybdenum production increased 3.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, principally due to higher production at the Buenavista mine due to higher recoveries. This increase was partially offset by lower production at our Peruvian mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries.​Zinc production increased 3.1% in 2018, due to higher production at our Santa Eulalia and Santa Barbara mines due to higher mineral milled.​Mined silver production increased 8.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, as we had increased silver production at all of our mines, except for our Cuajone mine.​​Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” on page 91. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties.In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to cover part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost.​We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address with operating management areas of concern. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our 70 Table of Contentsresources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry in determining whether to move forward with the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile.​Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2019:Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019 - 2018​2018 - 2017 ​​2019 2018 2017 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,230.9​$ 2,904.4​$ 2,797.5​$ 326.5 11.2% $ 106.9 3.8%Total by‑product revenues​$ (1,359.2)​$ (1,267.7)​$ (1,080.4)​$ (91.5) 7.2% (187.3) 17.3%Total operating cash cost net of by‑product revenues​$ 1,871.7​$ 1,636.7​$ 1,717.1​$ 235.0 14.4% $ (80.4) (4.7)%Total pounds of copper produced(2)​ 2,133.3​ 1,886.8​ 1,874.5​ 246.5 13.1% 12.3 0.7%Operating cash cost per pound before by‑product revenues​$ 1.52​$ 1.54​$ 1.49​$ (0.02) (1.3)% $ 0.05 3.4%By‑products per pound revenues​$ (0.64)​$ (0.67)​$ (0.57)​$ 0.03 (4.5)% $ (0.10) 17.5%Operating cash cost per pound net of by‑product revenues​$ 0.88​$ 0.87​$ 0.92​$ 0.01 1.1% $ (0.05) (5.4)%(1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 91 for reconciliation to GAAP measure.(2)Net of metallurgical losses.​2019 compared to 2018:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2019 was 1.3% lower when compared with 2018. This decrease was the result of the unit cost effect of 13.1% higher production. Meanwhile, our cash cost per pound when calculated net of by-product revenues for 2019 was 1.1% higher than in the same period of 2018 due to the higher production noted, as well as lower by-product revenues due to the additional copper volume effect.​2018 compared to 2017:​Our cash cost per pound before by-product revenues in 2018 was $1.54, 3.4% higher than in 2017. This increase in operating cash cost was mainly due to higher production costs, principally at our Peruvian operations. However, our per pound cash cost for 2018, when calculated net of by-product revenues was 5.4% lower than in 2017. This improvement was mainly the result of higher prices for our major by-products.​Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver.​We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments.​71 Table of ContentsFor 2020, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, that 2019 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effect to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Copper Molybdenum Zinc SilverChange in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce)​$ 0.10​$ 1.00​$ 0.10​$ 1.00Change in net earnings (in millions)​$ 140.1​$ 35.1​$ 14.5​$ 9.3​Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines, a coal mine, and several industrial processing facilities.​Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 18 “Segment and Related Information” of our consolidated financial statements.​Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we do believe such changes have not had a material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information.​Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $707.5 million in 2019, $1,121.4 million in 2018 and $1,023.5 million in 2017. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments.​72 Table of ContentsThe table below sets forth our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2019 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Peruvian projects:​​​​​​​​​Toquepala expansion project​$ 41.1​$ 392.4​$ 362.0Toquepala mine equipment acquisition​ —​ —​ 39.7Heavy mineral management optimizing project—Cuajone​ —​ 17.0​ 81.7Ilo 3 substation​ —​ 1.0​ 29.9HPGR system—Toquepala​ 7.6​ 7.8​ 18.8Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam​ 1.0​ 23.7​ 15.5Ilo sulfuric acid plant N°1 modification​ 5.1​ 15.3​ 4.4Pumping system neutralization plant - Toquepala​​ 8.0​​ —​​ —Other projects​ 37.8​ 24.1​ 10.0Sub‑total projects​ 100.6​ 481.3​ 562.0Maintenance and replacement​ 216.3​ 201.4​ 153.1Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ 33.2​ 91.3​ (29.7)Total Peruvian expenditures​ 350.1​ 774.0​ 685.4Mexican projects:​ ​​ ​ New Buenavista concentrator​ 1.0​ 5.8​ 24.7Buenavista projects infrastructure​ 1.1​ 2.3​ 1.9Buenavista SX‑EW plant III​ —​ —​ 1.1Quebalix IV​ 0.7​ 2.0​ 17.6New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine​ 35.8​ 56.7​ 79.2Over elevation of tailings deposit N° 7 at La Caridad mine​ 25.4​ 18.3​ —Sonora River water restitution system in Moritas Basin​ 1.8​ 6.0​ —Solutions system improvements of Tinajas​ 6.0​ 1.3​ 14.5San Martin mine restoration​​ 48.9​​ 13.5​​ —Other projects​ 85.7​ 63.5​ 63.0Sub‑total projects​ 206.4​ 169.4​ 202.0Maintenance and replacement​ 148.6​ 169.3​ 144.7Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ 2.4​ 8.7​ (8.6)Total Mexican expenditures​ 357.4​ 347.4​ 338.1Total capital investments​$ 707.5​$ 1,121.4​$ 1,023.5​In 2020, we plan to invest $1,146.7 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following:​Projects in Mexico:​Buenavista Zinc—Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. Currently, we have completed the basic engineering and obtained all environmental permits for the project. The project´s budget is $413 million, and we expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the Company’s zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. The process of bidding for the site preparation has started and the purchase orders for the major equipment have been placed.​Pilares—Sonora: This project, located six kilometers from La Caridad, will be developed as an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. The ore will be transported from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator through a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks, and will significantly improve the over-all mineral ore grade (combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with 0.34% from La Caridad). The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expect it to start production during the first half of 2022. The connection road between Pilares mine and La Caridad mine is now under construction.​73 Table of ContentsEl Pilar - Sonora: This is a low capital intensity copper greenfield project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. We estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. The construction of the pilot plant is finished and the production tests have recently begun. We expect this project to start production during 2023.​The San Martin mine restoration program: After eleven years of an illegal stoppage, we resumed control of the San Martin mine in August 2018. The San Martin facilities deteriorated during this period and we undertook a major renovation in order to restart operations during the second quarter of 2019. Currently, the mine has 200,000 tons of ore and the concentrator has initiated production. In 2019, we produced 5,837 tons of zinc, 1.2 million ounces of silver and 1,335 tons of copper. The budget of the restoration program is $97.7 million. At December 31, 2019 the program had a total expense of $73.6 million.​Projects in Peru:​Our main capital projects in Peru are the following:​Toquepala Expansion Project - Tacna: This $1,320 million project includes a new state-of-the-art concentrator which increased Toquepala’s annual copper production to 258,000 tons in 2019, a 51.5% production increase, when compared to 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we have invested $1,280.1 million in this expansion. Construction of the project was completed and production began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Full production was reached in the second quarter of 2019.​The project to improve the crushing process at Toquepala with the installation of a High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) system, has as its main objective, to ensure that our existing concentrator will operate at its maximum annual production capacity of 117,000 tons of copper while reducing operating costs through ore crushing efficiencies, even with an increase of the ore material hardness index. The budget for this project is $52 million and as of December 31, 2019, we have invested $51.9 million. We are in the administrative close-out process for this project, which was added to operations during the fourth quarter of 2018.​Cuajone tailing thickeners project - Moquegua: This project will replace two of the three existing thickeners at the concentrator with a new hi-rate thickener. The purpose is to streamline the concentrator flotation process and improve water recovery efficiency, increasing the tailings solids content from 54% to 61%, thereby reducing fresh water consumption and replacing it with recovered water. As of December 31, 2019, we have invested $31 million out of the approved budget of $31.3 million in this project. This project was finished in October 2019.​Tailings disposal at Quebrada Honda - Moquegua: This project increases the height of the existing Quebrada Honda dam to impound future tailings from the Toquepala and Cuajone concentrators and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by 25 years. The first stage and construction of the drainage system for the lateral dam is finished. We finished the second stage with the installation of a new cyclone battery station that allows us to place more slurry at the dams. We are evaluating improvements in operational processes of this facility. The project has a total budgeted cost of $116 million and we have invested $107.2 million through December 31, 2019. ​Potential projects:​We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy or market conditions. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our annual copper production to 1.5 million tons by 2028 with the development of new projects, which include the following:​74 Table of ContentsEl Arco - Baja California: This is a world class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves of over 2.7 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.399% and 0.11 grams of gold per ton. This project, includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations with an estimated production of 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. We are currently in the land acquisition process for the project.​Tia Maria - Arequipa: On July 8, 2019, we received the construction permit for this 120,000 ton annual SX-EW copper greenfield project with a total capital budget of $1,400 million. This permit was obtained after completing an exhaustive review process of environmental and social matters, complying with all established regulatory requirements and addressing all observations raised. ​The challenges to the construction permit were overcome when on October 30, 2019, the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines ratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project.​In coordination with the Peruvian Government, Southern Copper continues to work on common grounds for dialogue with the neighboring communities to address any concerns they may have on the project and is awaiting the proper economic and political conditions to move ahead with the project. Meanwhile, we reiterate our commitment to delay the construction of the project.​We guarantee to the population of Islay that the Tia Maria project will not adversely affect other local economic activities because we will use desalinated seawater for our operations and, for the transport of our supplies and copper production, we will build a 32 kilometer industrial railway and an access road at a safe distance from the Tambo Valley. ​Our social programs in education, healthcare and productive development will continue to improve the quality-of-life, and the agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley, as well as fishing and tourism in Islay. During the construction and operation phase, hiring local labor will be a priority. For this purpose, we have successfully launched in June 2019, the free technical training program “Forging the Future”, which will benefit 700 persons in this province in 2019-20. After training, the participants will be eligible to apply for one of the estimated 9,000 jobs (3,600 direct and 5,400 indirect) required during the Tia Maria construction phase. We believe that the initiation of construction activities for Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region.​When in operation, we expect Tia Maria will generate a significant contribution through mining royalties and taxes from day-one and will directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200 workers.​This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process with no emissions released into the atmosphere. ​Los Chancas—Apurimac: This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates indicate the presence of 545 million tons of mineralized material with a copper content of 0.59%, molybdenum content of 0.04% and 0.039 grams of gold per ton, as well as 181 million tons of mineralized leachable material with a total copper content of 0.357%. Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to annually produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum. The estimated capital investment is $2,800 million and is expected to be in operation in 2026. In 2018 and 2019, we developed social and environmental improvement programs for the local communities. For 2020, we plan to continue with these activities and to conclude the environmental impact assessment of the project.​Michiquillay Project—Cajamarca: On June 12, 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract and made an initial payment of $12.5 million for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. The Company has created a multidisciplinary management team to plan the development of this project. As part of this plan, the Company has established contact with the local authorities and communities in order to promote programs for the sustainable development of the area. In 2019, we developed social and environmental programs for the local communities and began a semi-detailed environmental impact assessment. This will allow us to begin a 40,000 meter diamond drilling program in 2020, to verify and update the estimated mineralized materials of the project.75 Table of ContentsMichiquillay is a world class mining project with estimated mineralized material of 1,150 million tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.63%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years, at a competitive cash-cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2026, with Michiquillay becoming one of Peru´s largest copper mines. The project will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the national, regional and local governments.​The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate.​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.​Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, ore stockpiles on leach pads and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, determination of discount rates related to the operating lease liabilities, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.​Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $2.90 per pound for copper and $7.50 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term.​However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ Average​​2019​2018​2017 ​2019 - 2017Copper ($per pound)​$ 2.72​$ 2.93​$ 2.80​$ 2.82Molybdenum ($per pound)​$ 11.35​$ 11.94​$ 8.21​$ 10.50​Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes to our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices), for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 “Properties—Ore reserves.”​76 Table of ContentsOre stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include on our balance sheet, current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method.​Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation.​Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to our consolidated financial statements included herein.​Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in few cases perhaps a few further months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7).​Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted.​A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.​Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Taxes” to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is 77 Table of Contentsmaterially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.​On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the TCJA”). The Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. In 2017, the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for income tax effects of the TCJA in accordance with SAB 118. For further information, see Note 7 “Income Taxes”, of our consolidated financial statements.​Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, reflective of what we believe is the lower level of the current price environment, for our impairment tests. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 times such carrying amount.​In recent years our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation reverse in the future with three year average prices below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value.​Leases: In 2019, the Company adopted the new leases standard and it resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations on the Company´s balance sheet. After the analysis of this standard, the Company concluded that all of its existing lease contracts are operating lease contracts. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation by the Company to make lease payments which arise from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the inception date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease contracts do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the inception date in order to determine the present value of lease payments.​​78 Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Statement of Earnings Data​2019 2018 2017​2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017Net sales​$ 7,285.6​$ 7,096.7​$ 6,654.5​$ 188.9​$ 442.2Operating costs and expenses​ (4,532.6)​ (4,215.5)​ (4,035.6)​ (317.1)​ (179.9)Operating income​ 2,753.0​ 2,881.2​ 2,618.9​ (128.2)​ 262.3Non‑operating income (expense)​ (326.5)​ (291.8)​ (316.2)​ (34.7)​ 24.4Income before income taxes​ 2,426.5​ 2,589.4​ 2,302.7​ (162.9)​ 286.7Income taxes​ (966.3)​ (1,105.0)​ (951.7)​ 138.7​ (153.3)Deferred income taxes​ 21.0​ 51.5​ (641.7)​ (30.5)​ 693.2Equity earnings of affiliate​ 10.7​ 12.3​ 23.1​ (1.6)​ (10.8)Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest​ (6.1)​ (5.2)​ (3.9)​ (0.9)​ (1.3)Net income attributable to SCC​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,543.0​$ 728.5​$ (57.2)​$ 814.5​NET SALES​2019-2018: Net sales in 2019 were $7,285.6 million, compared to $7,096.7 million in 2018, an increase of $188.9 million.

This brings the total recorded effect of the 2017 U.S. tax reform on the Company’s financial statements for 2017 and 2018 to a non-cash tax provision of $816.8 million.​Equity earnings of affiliate​In 2019, 2018 and 2017 we have recognized $10.7 million, $12.3 million and $23.1 million, respectively, of equity earnings of affiliate, from our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine.​Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest​Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2019 was $6.1 million, compared to $5.2 million in 2018, and $3.9 million in 2017. It increased in 2019 and 2018 by $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. These changes were the result of higher earnings at our Peruvian operations in both years.​Income attributable to SCC​Our net income attributable to SCC in 2019 was $1,485.8 million, compared to $1,543.0 million in 2018 and $728.5 million in 2017. Net income attributable to SCC decreased mainly due to increases in cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion. The increase in 2018 net income was mainly due to higher sales and lower taxes as the 2017 financial results included the one-time, non-cash income tax adjustment of $785.9 million recorded in 2017 as a result of the U.S. income tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. ​82 Table of ContentsSEGMENT RESULTS ANALYSIS​We have three segments: the Peruvian operations, the Mexican open-pit operations and the Mexican underground mining operations.

In 2017, we recorded a non-cash tax charge of $785.9 million related to the U.S. tax law change enacted in December 2017.​2019: Net income was $1,491.9 million, approximately 78% of the net cash provided from operating activities. A net decrease in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flow by $347.0 million and included:​●$(184.9) million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which included principally income taxes and workers’ participation payments as a result of higher earnings at our Mexican and Peruvian operations in 2018.●$(10.5) million increase in trade accounts receivable mainly because of higher sales volumes at our Peruvian operations.●$(88.7) million of net increase in inventory, which included $(83.2) million of higher leaching inventory and $(17.6) million of higher finished goods mainly at our Mexican operations.●$(62.9) million increase in other operating assets and liabilities which included principally an increase in prepaid taxes in our Mexican operations due to changes in tax legislation.​2018: Net income was $1,548.2 million, approximately 69% of the net cash provided from operating activities.

These included $357.4 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $350.1 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see “Capital Investment Program” under this Item on page 73.​The 2019 investing activities also include net sales of short-term investments of $133.1 million.​2018: Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 included $1,121.4 million for capital investments. These included $347.4 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $774.0 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see “Capital Investment Program” under this Item on page 73.​The 2018 investing activities also include net purchases of short-term investments of $163.3 million.​2017: Net cash used for investing activities in 2017 included $1,023.5 million for capital investments. These included $338.1 million of investments at our Mexican operations and $685.4 million of investments at our Peruvian operations. For further information, please see “Capital Investment Program” under this Item on page 73.​The 2017 investing activities also include net sales of short-term investments of $1.0 million.​Net cash used in financing activities:​2019: Net cash used in financing activities in 2019 was $262.2 million and mainly included:​●A dividend distribution of $1,236.9 million.●Gross proceeds of $987.3 million from the issuance of senior notes by our Mexican subsidiary.●Payment of debt issuance costs of $9.8 million.​2018: Net cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $1,083.4 million and included a dividend distribution of $1,082.3 million.​2017: Net cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $456.1 million and included a dividend distribution of $456.1 million.​Other Liquidity Considerations​We expect that we will meet our cash requirements for 2020 and beyond from cash on hand and internally generated funds. In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required.​As of December 31, 2019, $1,106.7 million of the Company´s total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $2,005.8 million were held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. At December 31, 2017, Minera Mexico had determined that it had earnings available for dividends to the United States of $555.5 million. The 2017 U.S. tax reform introduced a one-time transition tax that is based upon the higher of the Company’s total accumulated post-1986 deferred income as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017, estimated to be $8.9 billion, the majority of which was previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes were provided. During 2018, the Company finalized its transition tax at $153.1 million, which was fully offset by foreign tax credits. Upon enactment of the 2017 U.S. tax reform, the Company had calculated and recorded in 2017 a provisional amount of $181.1 million and reduced it by $28 million in 2018 when the calculation was finalized. Earnings of the Company’s Peruvian branch are not subject to transition taxes since they are taxed in the United States on a current basis.​88 Table of ContentsShare repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors (“BOD”) authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2018, we have purchased 119.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.9 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—SCC common stock repurchase plan.”​Dividend: On February 20, 2020, the BOD authorized a dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on March 24, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2020. ​FINANCING​Our total debt at December 31, 2019 was $6,940.8 million, compared to $5,960.1 million at December 31, 2018, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par of $110.4 million and $94.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.69%.​The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 50.2% at December 31, 2019, compared to 47.4% at December 31, 2018. In addition, the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 41.8% at December 31, 2019, compared to 42.6% at December 31, 2018.​We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities, and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” below.​Please see Note 11 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt.​Capital investment programs​A discussion of our capital investment programs is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7.​89 Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS​The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Payments due by Period​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ 2025 and​​Total​2020​2021​2022​2023​2024 Thereafter​​​​ (dollars in millions)Long‑term debt​$ 7,051.1​$ 400.0​$ —​$ 300.0​$ —​$ —​$ 6,351.1Interest on debt​ 7,890.0​ 378.8​ 380.0​ 378.4​ 369.4​ 369.5​ 6,013.9Uncertain tax position(a)​ 68.9​ 9.8​ 0.7​ —​ —​ —​ —Workers’ participation​ 174.9​ 174.9​ —​ —​ —​ —​ —Pension and post‑retirement obligations​ 40.1​ 4.5​ 3.2​ 3.3​ 3.4​ 3.7​ 22.0Operating leases​​ 1,386.5​​ 116.1​​ 116.0​​ 112.9​​ 111.6​​ 103.6​​ 826.3Asset retirement obligation​ 262.3​ -​ —​ —​ —​ —​ 262.3Purchase obligations:​ ​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Commitments to purchase energy​ 3,077.5​ 237.3​ 239.5​ 239.5​ 257.6​ 257.6​ 1,846.0Capital investment projects​ 198.2​ 198.2​ —​ —​ —​ —​ —Total​$ 20,149.5​$ 1,519.6​$ 739.4​$ 1,034.1​$ 742.0​$ 734.4​$ 15,321.6(a)The above table does not include any scheduled payments related to U.S. uncertain tax position liabilities because there is often a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows. As of December 31, 2019, the tax liability recognized by the Company is $68.9 million and is included as non-current liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet. Please refer to Note 7 “Income Taxes” of our consolidated financial statements.​Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $110.3 million.​Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2019. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities.​Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers following determination of final results for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary is distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law.​Operating leases include lease payments for power generating facilities to MGE, vehicles and properties. Please refer to Note 9 “Leases” of our consolidated financial statements.​Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit Plans” of our consolidated financial statements.​Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of the closure and remediation costs of our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation.”​In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (“MW”) with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (“Kallpa”), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, 90 Table of Contentsunder which Kallpa will supply energy for the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first.​Also we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments”.​Amounts indicated on the above table are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects, and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine.​CYBERSECURITY:​Our operations depend upon information technology systems which may be subject to disruption, damage or failure from different sources, including, without limitation, installation of malicious software, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks and defects in design. In recent years, cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have implemented appropriate preventative measures to mitigate potential risks by implementing an information security management system, which ensures putting into effect controls that are frequently reviewed and tested, including a risk matrix that considers all the possible threats with an impact and probability analysis, actions to avoid or mitigate them and the corresponding testing plan.​NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION​Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 70) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019 2018 2017​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundCost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)​$ 3,606.4​$ 1.69​$ 3,409.0​$ 1.81​$ 3,252.8​$ 1.74Add:​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​ ​ ​Selling, general and administrative​ 131.8​ 0.06​ 102.6​ 0.05​ 93.1​ 0.05Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges​ 28.7​ 0.02​ 13.9​ 0.01​ 22.4​ 0.01Less:​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Workers’ participation​ (214.5)​ (0.10)​ (226.1)​ (0.12)​ (196.2)​ (0.11)Cost of metals purchased from third parties​ (263.4)​ (0.12)​ (384.5)​ (0.20)​ (363.2)​ (0.19)Royalty charge and other, net​ (125.7)​ (0.06)​ (125.0)​ (0.07)​ (150.5)​ (0.08)Inventory change​ 67.6​ 0.03​ 114.5​ 0.06​ 139.1​ 0.07Operating Cash Cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,230.9​$ 1.52​$ 2,904.4​$ 1.54​$ 2,797.5​$ 1.49Add:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ By‑product revenues(1)​ (1,307.3)​ (0.61)​ (1,211.4)​ (0.64)​ (1,030.2)​ (0.55)Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties​ (51.9)​ (0.03)​ (56.3)​ (0.03)​ (50.2)​ (0.02)Total by‑product revenues​ (1,359.2)​ (0.64)​ (1,267.7)​ (0.67)​ (1,080.4)​ (0.57)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating Cash Cost net of by‑product revenues​ 1,871.7​ 0.88​ 1,636.7​ 0.87​ 1,717.1​ 0.92​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total pounds of copper produced (in millions)​ 2,133.3​ ​ 1,886.8​ ​ 1,874.5​ 91 Table of Contents(1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019 2018 2017​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundMolybdenum​$ (549.4)​$ (0.26)​$ (509.9)​$ (0.27)​$ (353.4)​$ (0.19)Silver​ (278.3)​ (0.13)​ (244.5)​ (0.13)​ (254.9)​ (0.14)Zinc​ (211.5)​ (0.10)​ (229.5)​ (0.12)​ (221.6)​ (0.12)Sulfuric Acid​ (158.8)​ (0.07)​ (111.3)​ (0.06)​ (71.9)​ (0.04)Gold​ (53.2)​ (0.03)​ (53.1)​ (0.03)​ (61.7)​ (0.03)Other​ (56.1)​ (0.02)​ (63.1)​ (0.03)​ (66.7)​ (0.03)Total​$ (1,307.3)​$ (0.61)​$ (1,211.4)​$ (0.64)​$ (1,030.2)​$ (0.55)​The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 150 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​Net debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018​Total debt​$ 6,940.8​$ 5,960.1​Cash and cash equivalents​ (1,925.1)​ (844.6)​Short‑term investments​ (80.7)​ (213.8)​Net debt​ 4,935.0​ 4,901.7​Net capitalization:​ ​ ​Net debt​ 4,935.0​ 4,901.7​Equity​ 6,858.2​ 6,612.8​Net capitalization​$ 11,793.2​$ 11,514.5​Net debt/net capitalization(*)​ 41.8% 42.6%(*)Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.​Total debt to total capitalization: Total debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018​Total debt​$ 6,940.8​$ 5,960.1​Capitalization​ ​ ​Debt​ 6,940.8​ 5,960.1​Equity​ 6,858.2​ 6,612.8​Total capitalization​$ 13,799.0​$ 12,572.9​Total debt/total capitalization(*)​ 50.3% 47.4%(*)Represents debt divided by total capitalization.​92 Table of Contents​ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK​Commodity price risk:For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to “Metal Prices” in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report.​Open sales risk:Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales.​Foreign currency exchange rate risk:​Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Since our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2019, are provided in the table below:​​​​​​​​​​ Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2019 2018 2017​Peru: ​Peruvian inflation rate 1.9% 2.5% 1.5%Initial exchange rate 3.379 3.245 3.360​Closing exchange rate 3.317 3.379 3.245​Appreciation/(devaluation) 1.8% (4.1)% 3.4%Mexico: ​Mexican inflation rate 2.8% 4.8% 6.8%​​​​​​​​Initial exchange rate 19.683 19.735 20.664​Closing exchange rate 18.845 19.683 19.735​Appreciation/(devaluation) 4.3% 0.3% 4.5%​Change in monetary position:​Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2019, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows:​​​​​ Effect in net​ earnings​ ($ in millions)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ 18.0Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ (22.0)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ (9.7)Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ 11.8​The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated at December 31, 2019.​Short-term investments:​For additional information on our trading securities and available-for-sale investments, refer to Note 3 Short-term Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.​93 Table of Contents​",2023-12-30 21:06:50.580200
1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2021,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” “Southern Copper,” “the Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results.​This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business—Cautionary Statement.”​EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW​Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales and our principal operations are in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. ​We believe we hold the world’s largest copper reserve position. As of December 31, 2020, our copper ore reserves, calculated at a copper price of $3.00 per pound, totaled 67.7 million tons of contained copper, at the following locations:​​​​Copper contained in ore reserves Thousand tonsMexican open‑pit 30,346Peruvian operations 22,439IMMSA 256Development projects 14,647Total 67,688​Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following:​●Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 81.0% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 7.0% from molybdenum, 4.0% from zinc, 5.0% from silver and 3.0% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials.​●Copper: In the last quarter of 2020, the LME copper price increased, from an average of $2.67 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $3.25 (+21.7%). Currently, we are seeing prices over $3.60 per pound, which bodes a positive outlook for the 2021 copper market. We believe the following factors are influencing the market:​●A worldwide recovery in copper demand for industrial uses, driven mainly by a sustained recovery in economic activity in China and other Asian economies and in the European auto industry.●Regarding China, it should also be noted that copper scrap imports have decreased by 48% in the last 10 months of 2020, which led to a subsequent increase in Chinese consumption of refined copper.69 Table of Contents●The combined inventories of the LME, Comex, Shanghai and Bonded warehouses closed 2020 at their lowest levels since December 2014.​Given the current market outlook for supply and demand, we have a positive view for this year and for the long-term evolution of the copper market. ​●Molybdenum: It represented approximately 6.4% of our sales in 2020. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.57 per pound in 2020, compared to $11.27 in 2019, a 24.0% decrease.​Molybdenum is mainly used to produce special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production.​●Zinc: Although average zinc prices decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 (-11.0%), we believe zinc has very good long-term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and expected production. Zinc represented 3.1% of our sales in 2020.​●Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 5.6% of our sales in 2020.​●Production: In 2021 and 2022, we expect to produce 943,000 tons of copper given that production during these periods will be affected by a temporary reduction in ore grade and recovery at our Peruvian operations.​We expect our copper production to recover by 2023 and reach 1,031,000 tons of production as we get Peruvian production back on track and generate new production on our Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista-Zinc Concentrator projects. ​We also expect to produce 21.4 million ounces of silver in 2021, in line with 2020 production. In 2021, we expect to produce 76,200 tons of zinc from our mines, up 10.5% from 2020 production level. Additionally, we expect to produce 26,800 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 11.3% compared to 2020 production levels.​●Capital investments: Capital investments were $592.2 million for 2020. This is 16.3% lower than in 2019, and represented 37.7% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan to increase our copper volume production to 1.9 million tons by 2028 with the development of new projects.​For 2021, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,431.3 million.​COVID-19​In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on a rapid increase in global transmission rates. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will continue and the magnitude of the impact on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future operating results is uncertain. Senior management is actively monitoring the global situation´s effect on the Company´s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce and is focusing principally on the health, safety and well-being of our employees, their families and the communities where we have operations. As of December 31, 2020, there have been no major delays in the supply of the materials and services critical for operations and sales. In addition, the supply of non-critical materials and services for the operations is gradually being restored. Additionally, shipments of products and collections experienced no known major delays in the fourth quarter of 2020.​As of December 31, 2020, we continued to see a positive trend in the copper price, which closed at $3.51 per pound (LME) after it registered a drop to $2.18 per pound at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Considering the market outlook previously described, we have a positive view for 2021 and for the long-term evolution of the copper market. ​70 Table of ContentsThe Company maintains a solid financial position and performance level. We believe this has allowed and will continue to allow us to deal with the effects of the pandemic in a way that prevents adverse material effects on our operations and financial results. The table below compares some of our financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:​20202019​($ in millions, except ratios)​Cash and cash equivalents2,183.61,925.1​Accounts receivable1,136.6911.8​Total assets16,946.516,407.4​Long term debt6,544.26,541.0​Sales7,984.97,285.6​​RATIOS​Current assets to current liabilities3.492.83​Accounts receivable turnover (1)7.037.99​Total debt ratio (2)0.390.42​Net income margin (3)19.7%20.4%​(1)Represents net sales divided by accounts receivable.(2)Represents total debt divided by total assets.(3)Represents net income divided by net sales, as a percentage.​Governmental authorities in Mexico and Peru have declared that essential economic activities must continue during the COVID-19 health emergency. These activities include industrial mining and/or any other activity necessary to ensure the provision of essential services such as electricity; provide elements to install medical and hospital infrastructure; and manufacture health-related supplies and technological equipment. We believe that industrial mining stands as the most efficient and timely supplier of inputs that are critical to the productive chain to fight the pandemic.​Given the nature of mining operations, which are highly automated, conducted in remote locations and with mandatory use of personal safety equipment at all the mines, it is easier to implement and comply with COVID-19 protective measures, such as physical isolation and control of access to facilities. Industrial mining uses advanced and reliable machinery and does not require high physical concentration of employees. In many cases, workers fulfill their duties maintaining distances of more than 100 meters from their closest coworkers. ​At the present time, our operations are in compliance with all sanitary and government regulations and maintain proper environmental safeguards. Our COVID-19 emergency protocol has reinforced preventive measures such as disinfecting, clinical monitoring before work, cleaning and sanitizing of work areas and respect for social distancing. We have also restricted the access of contractors, suppliers and personnel to our facilities if visits are not indispensable and enforced multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to COVID-19 by imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings and urging frequent hand washing, as well as adhering to all other health, safety and social distancing measures required by governmental authorities. At December 31, 2020, approximately 92% of the workforce in Mexico was working on site or at home under strict safety measures; the remaining 8% of the workforce was not working, including all individuals at high risk due to age and/or preexisting medical conditions. At our Peruvian operations, approximately 63% of the workforce was working onsite or at home under strict safety measures, while the remaining 37% was not working, including all individuals at high risk due to age and/or preexisting medical conditions. Through December 31, 2020, SCC incurred approximately $27.6 million in COVID-19 related production costs that include protective equipment and labor costs. These costs have been expensed to cost of sales in the Company´s consolidated statement of earnings.71 Table of Contents​KEY MATTERS​Below, we discuss several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program.​Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​ ​ Variance​​2020 2019 2018 2020 - 2019 2019 - 2018Copper price LME​​ 2.80​​ 2.72​​ 2.96​​ 0.08 ​ (0.24)Pounds of copper sold​​ 2,305.9​​ 2,173.8​​ 1,952.9​​ 132.1 ​ 220.9Net sales​$ 7,984.9​$ 7,285.6​$ 7,096.7​$ 699.3​$ 188.9Operating income​$ 3,120.7​$ 2,753.0​$ 2,881.2​$ 367.7​$ (128.2)Income before income taxes​$ 2,745.8​$ 2,426.5​$ 2,589.4​$ 319.3​$ (162.9)Net income attributable to SCC​$ 1,570.4​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,543.0​$ 84.6​$ (57.2)Earnings per share​$ 2.03​$ 1.92​$ 2.00​$ 0.11​$ (0.08)Dividends per share​$ 1.50​$ 1.60​$ 1.40​$ (0.10)​$ 0.20​Net sales in 2020 of $8.0 billion were the highest in our history and exceeded those recorded in 2019 by $699.3 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+6.1%), molybdenum (+12.7%) and silver (+8.8%) sales volumes, as well as higher copper (+2.9%) and silver (+27.6%) prices; this effect was partially offset by lower molybdenum (-24.0%) prices. Net sales in 2019 of $7.3 billion were higher than in 2018 by $188.9 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+11.3%), molybdenum (+21.7%) and silver (+5.7%) sales volumes and was partially offset by lower copper (−8.1%) and molybdenum (−5.0%) prices.​The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion, both of which increased in each of the years in the periods shown above. In 2020, cost of sales increased by $323.4 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $11.2 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2020 was mainly due to an increase in the cost of metals purchased from third parties and a decrease in the capitalization of leachable material. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of diesel and fuel. In 2019, cost of sales increased by $197.4 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $90.1 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2019 was mainly due to higher repairing materials and operating contractors’ costs, as well as a decrease in capitalized leachable material. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of metals purchased from third parties.​Net income attributable to SCC in 2020 was 5.7% higher than reported in 2019; this was mainly due to higher sales volumes and to higher copper and silver prices. Net income attributable to SCC in 2019 was 3.6% lower than in 2018; this was primarily driven by a decrease in prices for copper and molybdenum, despite an increase in sales volumes.​​72 Table of ContentsProduction: The table below contains mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2020 - 2019​2019 - 2018 ​​2020 2019 2018 Volume %​Volume % Copper (in million pounds) 2,207.6 2,191.0 1,948.2 16.6 0.8% 242.8 12.5%Molybdenum (in million pounds) 66.7 59.3 48.5 7.4 12.5% 10.8 22.3%Zinc (in million pounds) 152.0 163.0 156.0 (11.0) (6.8)% 7.0 4.5%Silver (in million ounces) 21.5 20.3 17.3 1.2 6.2% 3.0 17.3%​The table below contains copper production data from each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2020 - 20192019 - 2018 Copper (in million pounds):​2020 2019 2018 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 562.4 568.8 375.4 (6.4) (1.1)% 193.4 51.5%Cuajone 371.8 344.8 354.0 27.0 7.8% (9.2) (2.6)%La Caridad 298.8 293.4 292.1 5.4 1.8% 1.3 0.4%Buenavista 951.9 965.8 913.0 (13.9) (1.4)% 52.8 5.8%IMMSA 22.7 18.2 13.7 4.5 24.6% 4.5 32.8%Total mined copper 2,207.6 2,191.0 1,948.2 16.6 0.8% 242.8 12.5%​2020 compared to 2019:​Copper mine production in 2020 increased 0.8% to 2,207.6 million pounds, up from 2,191.0 million pounds in 2019. This increase was due to:​●Higher production at the Cuajone mine (+7.8%), which was driven by an increase in ore grades and recoveries. ●Higher production at the La Caridad mine (+1.8%).●Higher production at the IMMSA operations (+24.6%), which was attributable to an increase in ore grades.​Molybdenum production increased 12.5% in 2020 compared to the level in 2019 due to an increase in production at our Toquepala (+37.7%), Cuajone (+28.6%) and La Caridad (+3.2%) operations; this was partially offset by a decrease in production at our Buenavista (-10.6%) mine.​Zinc production decreased 6.8% in 2020, which was driven by a decrease in ore grades and in production at our Santa Eulalia (-96.0%) and Los Charcas (-5.0%) operations; this was partially offset by an increase in production at our San Martin (+151.0%) mine, which restored production to full capacity at the end of the third quarter of 2019.​Mined silver production increased 6.2% in 2020 compared to the level recorded in 2019; this was mainly due to an increase in production at our Cuajone (+8.8%), La Caridad (+16.4%) and IMMSA (+15.0%) operations, which was partially offset by a decrease in production at the Toquepala (-2.4%) and Buenavista (-3.6%) mines.​2019 compared to 2018:​Copper mine production in 2019 increased 12.5% to 2,191.0 million pounds from 1,948.2 million pounds in 2018. This increase was due to:​●Higher production at the Toquepala mine (+51.5%), as a result of additional copper production of 93,108 tons from the successful ramping up of the new concentrator. ●Higher production at the Buenavista mine (+5.8%) due to operating improvements at our new Buenavista plants, the SX/EW (+12.2%) and concentrator (+4.0%).73 Table of Contents●Higher production at the IMMSA operations (+32.9%), as result of the restoration of the San Martin mine operations.​Molybdenum production increased 22.3% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher production at all of our mines, principally at the Toquepala mine (+75%) due to the successful ramping up of the new molybdenum plant that started production in April 2019.​Zinc production increased 4.4% in 2019, as a result of higher production at our Santa Barbara mine due to higher grades and recoveries, as well as the restored production of 5,837 tons from our San Martin mine.​Mined silver production increased 17.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala (+60.5%), IMMSA (+22.9%) and Buenavista (+11.5%) operations, partially offset by lower production at the La Caridad (-6.6%) and Cuajone (-3.2%) mines.​Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” on page 96. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additional exclusions from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we believe is one of the lowest of all copper-producing companies of similar size.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to covering part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost.​We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address areas of concern within operating management. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in 74 Table of Contentsthe copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry to determine whether to move forward or not in the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile.​Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2020:​Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020 - 2019​2019 - 2018 ​​2020 2019 2018 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost before by‑product revenues​$ 2,923.7​$ 3,230.9​$ 2,904.4​$ (307.2) (9.5)% $ 326.5 11.2%Total by‑product revenues​$ (1,455.9)​$ (1,359.2)​$ (1,267.7)​$ (96.7) 7.1% (91.5) 7.2%Total operating cash cost net of by‑product revenues​$ 1,467.8​$ 1,871.7​$ 1,636.7​$ (403.9) (21.6)% $ 235.0 14.4%Total pounds of copper produced(2)​ 2,136.1​ 2,133.3​ 1,886.8​ 2.8 0.1% 246.5 13.1%Operating cash cost per pound before by‑product revenues​$ 1.37​$ 1.52​$ 1.54​$ (0.15) (9.9)% $ (0.02) (1.3)%By‑products per pound revenues​$ (0.68)​$ (0.64)​$ (0.67)​$ (0.04) 6.3% $ 0.03 (4.5)%Operating cash cost per pound net of by‑product revenues​$ 0.69​$ 0.88​$ 0.87​$ (0.19) (21.7)% $ 0.01 1.1%(1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 96 for reconciliation to GAAP measure.(2)Net of metallurgical losses.​2020 compared to 2019:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2020 was 9.9% lower than that recorded in 2019. This reduction is mainly attributable to a temporary decrease in production costs, as some operating, stripping and maintenance costs were reduced or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues for 2020 was 21.7% below that seen for the same period of 2019 and was also attributable to the temporary decrease in production costs outlined above.​2019 compared to 2018:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2019 was 1.3% lower when compared with 2018. This decrease was the result of the unit cost effect of 13.1% higher production. Meanwhile, our cash cost per pound when calculated net of by-product revenues for 2019 was 1.1% higher than in the same period of 2018 due to the higher production noted, as well as lower by-product revenues due to the additional copper volume effect.​Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver.​We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments.75 Table of Contents​For 2021, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved; 2020 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects relative to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Copper Molybdenum Zinc SilverChange in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce)​$ 0.10​$ 1.00​$ 0.10​$ 1.00Change in net earnings (in millions)​$ 122.2​$ 35.8​$ 14.3​$ 13.5​Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines and several industrial processing facilities.​Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 18 “Segment and Related Information” of the consolidated financial statements.​Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we believe these changes have had no material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information.​Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $592.2 million in 2020, $707.5 million in 2019 and $1,121.4 million in 2018. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments.​76 Table of ContentsThe table below contains information on our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2020 2019 2018Peruvian projects:​​​​​​​​​Toquepala expansion project​$ 5.1​$ 41.1​$ 392.4Quebrada Honda dam expansion​ 30.9​ —​ —Heavy mineral management optimizing project—Cuajone​ —​ —​ 17.0Toquepala mine truck acquisition​ 9.7​ —​ —HPGR system—Toquepala​ —​ 7.6​ 7.8Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam​ 0.4​ 1.0​ 23.7Ilo sulfuric acid plant N°1 modification​ 2.0​ 5.1​ 15.3Pumping system neutralization plant - Toquepala​​ 5.1​​ 8.0​​ —Other projects​ 46.8​ 37.8​ 25.1Sub‑total projects​ 100.0​ 100.6​ 481.3Maintenance and replacement​ 109.4​ 216.3​ 201.4Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ (14.4)​ 33.2​ 91.3Total Peruvian expenditures​ 195.0​ 350.1​ 774.0Mexican projects:​ ​​ ​ New Buenavista concentrator​ 68.3​ 1.0​ 5.8Pilares Mine​​ 33.4​​ —​​ —Buenavista projects infrastructure​ —​ 1.1​ 2.3Solutions system improvements of Tinajas​ 10.0​ 6.0​ 1.3Quebalix IV​ 0.1​ 0.7​ 2.0New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine​ 27.0​ 35.8​ 56.7Over elevation of tailings deposit N° 7 at La Caridad mine​ 11.0​ 25.4​ 18Sonora River water restitution system in Moritas Basin​ —​ 1.8​ 6San Martin mine restoration​​ 21.1​​ 48.9​​ 13.5Other projects​ 109.5​ 85.7​ 63.5Sub‑total projects​ 280.4​ 206.4​ 169.4Maintenance and replacement​ 132.5​ 148.6​ 169.3Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ (15.7)​ 2.4​ 8.7Total Mexican expenditures​ 397.2​ 357.4​ 347.4Total capital investments​$ 592.2​$ 707.5​$ 1,121.4​In 2021, we plan to invest $1,431.3 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following:​Projects in Mexico:​Buenavista Zinc - Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering study has reached 81% completion. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment, some of which is currently being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits. The project´s budget is $413 million, and we expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, we anticipate that this new facility will double the Company’s zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. ​Pilares - Sonora: This project, located six kilometers from La Caridad, will be developed as an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. The ore will be transported from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator through a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks, which is under construction, and will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade (combining the 0.78% 77 Table of Contentsexpected from Pilares with 0.34% from La Caridad). The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of 2022. ​El Pilar - Sonora: This is a low-capital intensity copper development project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.301%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. We estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. Construction at the pilot plant and experimental pads has ended and tests are being performed. The results from experimental pads on leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. We expect this project to start production in 2023 with an expected mine life of 13 years.​The San Martin mine recovery program. After eleven years of illegal stoppage, we resumed control of the San Martin mine in August 2018. The San Martin facilities deteriorated during this period but we made a major renovation and restarted operations during the second quarter of 2019. In 2020, we produced 14,361 tons of zinc, 2.8 million ounces of silver, 3,601 tons of copper, and 1,425 tons of lead. The budget for the restoration program is $97.7 million. As of December 31, 2020 the program reported a total expense of $86.4 million.​Projects in Peru:​Quebrada Honda dam expansion – Tacna: This project aims to enlarge the main and lateral dams in Quebrada Honda and includes the relocation of some facilities due to dam growth and implementation of other facilities for water recovery, among other factors. As of December 31, 2020, the engineering study is complete and we have initiated the procurement process for the necessary materials and equipment. This project has a total budget of $140.0 million, of which we have invested $32 million as of December 31, 2020. Progress on the Project is 41% according to the plan.​Tia Maria - Arequipa: On July 8, 2019, we were granted the construction permit for this 120,000 ton annual SX-EW copper greenfield project with a total capital budget of $1,400 million. The Government awarded the permit after completing an exhaustive review process, complying with all established regulatory requirements and addressing all observations raised. The challenges surrounding the construction permit were overcome when on October 30, 2019, the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines ratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project.​The Company has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality-of-life in the region. We also have promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.​We consider that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs (3,600 direct and 5,400 indirect) that we expect to generate during Tia Maria’s construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day one of our operations, we will generate significant contributions to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.​This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process with no emissions released into the atmosphere. ​Potential projects:​We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other 78 Table of Contentsfactors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy, market conditions or the COVID-19 pandemic. ​El Arco - Baja California: This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves of 2.4 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.422%, 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288% and 0.11 grams of gold per ton. This project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined concentrator and SX-EW operations, with an estimated production capacity of 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. The project has an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The Company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. We are currently in the final stage of the land acquisition process for the project.​Los Chancas—Apurimac: This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates indicate the presence of 545 million tons of mineralized material with a copper content of 0.59%, molybdenum content of 0.04% and 0.039 grams of gold per ton, as well as 181 million tons of mineralized leachable material with a total copper content of 0.357%. Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is $2,600 million and the project is expected to be in operation in 2027. In 2019, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities. In 2020, we continued to work on these activities and plan to conclude the environmental impact assessment for the project in 2021.​Michiquillay Project—Cajamarca: On June 12, 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract and made an initial payment of $12.5 million for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. The Company has created a multidisciplinary management team to plan the development of this project. As part of this plan, the Company has established contact with the local and regional authorities and communities to promote programs to sustainably develop the area. In 2020, we continued to develop social and environmental programs for the local communities and are concluding a semi-detailed environmental impact assessment. This will allow us to begin a 50,000 meter diamond drilling program in 2021 to verify and update the project´s estimated mineralized materials.​Michiquillay is a world class mining project with estimated mineralized material of 1,150 million tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.63%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash-cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2028. We believe that Michiquillay will become one of Peru´s largest copper mines. The project will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments.​The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate.​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.​Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to 79 Table of Contentsmanagement. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, ore stockpiles on leach pads and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, determination of discount rates related to the operating lease liabilities, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.​Ore Reserves: For internal ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $3.00 per pound for copper and $9.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term and are based on internal estimates for the curves of long-term metal prices.​However, pursuant to SEC guidance, the reserve information in this report is calculated using average metal prices for the most recent three-year period, except as otherwise stated. We refer to these three-year average metals prices as “current average prices.” Our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by COMEX, and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated using prices published in Platt’s Metals Week. Unless otherwise stated, reserve estimates in this report use the following three years average prices for copper and molybdenum as of December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ Average​​2020​2019​2018 ​2020 - 2018Copper ($per pound)​$ 2.80​$ 2.72​$ 2.93​$ 2.82Molybdenum ($per pound)​$ 8.69​$ 11.35​$ 11.94​$ 10.66​Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes in our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. A 20% increase or decrease in three-year average copper prices (current prices) for mineral reserves estimation, which is a reasonable possibility, would not materially affect our statement of earnings as the amount of reserves would not change significantly. Please see Item 2 “Properties—Ore reserves.”​Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory on our balance sheet. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method.​On January 1, 2020, the Company aligned its capitalization method for its Peruvian and Mexican operations to capitalize based on the allocation of copper content recoverable between ore and leach material. In addition, inventory consumption is now valued at the average unit cost, instead of the declining percentages of recovery method used previously. As a result of these changes, during 2020 the value of capitalized material decreased by $196.4 million and consumption decreased by $29.3 million when compared to the previous capitalization method.​Management has evaluated ASC 250-10 and considered appropriate guidance to conclude that the aforementioned classifies as a change in accounting estimate, and therefore should affect accounting books prospectively. Management believes that this new method will result in a more accurate valuation of this material.​Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the 80 Table of Contentsamounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. In 2020, the Company made a change in the estimate for the asset retirement obligation for its Mexican operations, mainly due to a detailed review of the closing activities required for each facility. The effect of this change was an increase in the asset retirement obligation of $269.3 million, which was recorded in December 2020.​Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to the consolidated financial statements included herein.​Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in a few cases, in a period that can exceed three months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7).​Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted.​A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.​Our Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We follow the guidance of ASC 740 “Income Taxes” to record these liabilities. (See Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.​On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from 35% to a flat 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system; and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. To address circumstances that could arise because of the late passage of TCJA in 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant lacked sufficient information prepared or analyzed 81 Table of Contentsin reasonable detail, to complete accounting under ASC 740 “Accounting For Income Taxes” during the following year (2018). ​Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, which reflect what we believe, for impairment test purposes, is the lower range of the current price environment. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound, showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.3 to 4.3 times such carrying amount.​In recent years, our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation change in the future with three-year average prices falling below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three-year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment compared to fair value.​Leases: In 2019, the Company adopted the new leases standard and it resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations on the Company´s balance sheet. After the analysis of this standard, the Company concluded that all of its existing lease contracts are operating lease contracts. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation by the Company to make lease payments that arise from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the inception date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease contracts do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the inception date to determine the present value of lease payments.​​82 Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Statement of Earnings Data​2020 2019 2018​2020 - 2019 2019 - 2018Net sales​$ 7,984.9​$ 7,285.6​$ 7,096.7​$ 699.3​$ 188.9Operating costs and expenses​ (4,864.2)​ (4,532.6)​ (4,215.5)​ (331.6)​ (317.1)Operating income​ 3,120.7​ 2,753.0​ 2,881.2​ 367.7​ (128.2)Non‑operating income (expense)​ (374.9)​ (326.5)​ (291.8)​ (48.4)​ (34.7)Income before income taxes​ 2,745.8​ 2,426.5​ 2,589.4​ 319.3​ (162.9)Income taxes​ (1,237.9)​ (966.3)​ (1,105.0)​ (271.6)​ 138.7Deferred income taxes​ 63.5​ 21.0​ 51.5​ 42.5​ (30.5)Equity earnings of affiliate​ 6.4​ 10.7​ 12.3​ (4.3)​ (1.6)Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest​ (7.4)​ (6.1)​ (5.2)​ (1.3)​ (0.9)Net income attributable to SCC​$ 1,570.4​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,543.0​$ 84.6​$ (57.2)​NET SALES​2020-2019: Net sales in 2020 were $7,984.9 million, compared to $7,285.6 million in 2019, which represented an increase of $699.3 million.

The $48.4 million increase in net expense in 2019 was mainly due to:​●$ 20.5 million increase in the miscellaneous expense, net, principally due to a $24.2 million provision related to rain damages at our Peruvian operations.●$ 20.5 million increase in interest expense, which was attributable to the Minera Mexico debt issuance in September 2019;●$ 5.4 million decrease in capitalized interest, given that completed projects in Peru have been transferred to operations, and●$ 2.0 million of lower interest income.​2019-2018: Non-operating income and expense were a net expense of $326.5 million in 2019 compared to a net expense of $291.8 million in 2018. The $34.7 million increase in net expense in 2019 was mainly due to:​●$ 51.6 million of lower capitalized interest, as completed projects in Peru have been transferred to operations.●$ 12.0 million of higher interest expense due to the Minera Mexico debt issuance in September 2019; partially offset by,●$ 23.7 million of lower miscellaneous expense, net, which includes a $25.0 million insurance payment due to rain damages suffered in our Peruvian operations, and●$ 5.2 million of higher interest income.​Income taxes​​​​​​​​​​​​ Year Ended ​​December 31, ​​2020 2019​2018​Provision for income taxes ($ in millions)​$ 1,174.4​$ 945.3​$ 1,053.5​Effective income tax rate​ 42.8% ​ 39.0% ​ 40.7%​The income tax provision includes Peruvian, Mexican and U.S. federal and state income taxes.​85 Table of ContentsComponents of income tax provision for 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the following ($ in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2020 2019 2018Statutory income tax provision​$ 1,020.9​$ 831.4​$ 903.4Tax reform adjustment​ —​ —​ 30.9Peruvian royalty​ 31.4​ 14.2​ 9.0Mexican royalty​ 72.1​ 61.6​ 79.6Peruvian special mining tax​ 50.0​ 38.1​ 30.6Total income tax provision​$ 1,174.4​$ 945.3​$ 1,053.5​The increase in the 2020 effective income tax rate from the prior year was primarily attributable to a movement in exchange gains and losses from the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the Peruvian sol against the U.S. dollar; an increase in the Peruvian special mining tax; and an increase in the Mexican and Peruvian royalty. In 2018 the Company, pursuant to SAB 118, completed its analysis of the effects of the 2017 U.S. tax reform and recorded a non-cash tax provision of $30.9 million in addition to the non-cash amount of $785.9 recorded in 2017. After applying the conditions of US tax reform in 2017, the aforementioned led to a total non-cash tax provision for 2017 and 2018 to $816.8 million.​Equity earnings of affiliate​In 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recognized $6.4 million, $10.7 million and $12.3 million in equity earnings, respectively, which were associated with our 44.2% interest in the Tantahuatay mine.​Net Income attributable to the non-controlling interest​Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in 2020 was $7.4 million, compared to $6.1 million in 2019, and $5.2 million in 2018. This increased in 2020 and 2019 by $1.3 million and $0.9 million respectively. These changes were the result of higher earnings at our Peruvian operations in both years.​Income attributable to SCC​Our net income attributable to SCC in 2020 was $1,570.4 million, compared to $1,485.8 million in 2019 and $1,543.0 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 net income attributable to SCC was mainly due to growth in net sales. Net income attributable to SCC decreased in 2019, which was mainly due to increases in the cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion. ​SEGMENT RESULTS ANALYSIS​We have three segments: the Peruvian operations, the Mexican open-pit operations and the Mexican underground mining operations.

In addition, we believe that we will be able to access additional external financing on reasonable terms, if required.​As of December 31, 2020, $1,297.3 million of the Company´s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2,594.4 million were held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments maintained in our foreign operations are generally used to cover local operating and investment expenses. Earnings of the Company’s Peruvian branch are not subject to transition taxes since they are taxed in the United States on a current basis.​Share repurchase program: In 2008, our Board of Directors (“BOD”) authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2020, we have purchased 119.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.9 billion. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. For further details please see Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—SCC common stock repurchase plan.”​Dividend: On January 21, 2021, the BOD authorized a dividend of $0.60 per share to be paid on February 24, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021. ​FINANCING​Our total debt at December 31, 2020 was $6,544.2 million, compared to $6,940.8 million at December 31, 2019, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs of notes issued under par for $107.0 million and $110.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.69%.​The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 47.4% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 50.2% as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 35.2% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 41.8% as of December 31, 2019.​We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and of the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” below.​Please see Note 11 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt.​Capital Investment Program​A discussion of our capital investment program is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources.

As of December 31, 2020, the tax liability recognized by the Company is $66.1 million and is netted against the deferred tax asset in the consolidated Balance Sheet. Please refer to Note 7 “Income Taxes” of the consolidated financial statements.​Long-term debt payments do not include the debt discount valuation account and issuance costs of $107.0 million.​Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2020. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities.​Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers after final results are determined for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary are distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law.​Operating leases include lease payments for power generating facilities to MGE, vehicles and properties. Please refer to Note 9 “Leases” of the consolidated financial statements.​Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit Plans” of the consolidated financial statements.​Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of closure and remediation costs for our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation.”​In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (“MW”) with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (“Kallpa”), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, 94 Table of Contentsunder which Kallpa will supply energy to the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and to other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first.​Additionally, we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments”.​Amounts indicated in the table above are based on our long-term estimated power costs, which are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. ​Capital investment projects include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects and for our Peruvian expansion projects at Tia Maria and the Toquepala mine.​CYBERSECURITY​Our operations depend upon information technology systems that may be subject to disruption, damage or failure from different sources, including, without limitation, installation of malicious software, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks and defects in design. In recent years, cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have implemented appropriate preventative measures to mitigate potential risks by implementing an information security management system, which ensures implementing controls that are frequently reviewed and tested, including a risk matrix that considers the possible threats through an impact and probability analysis, actions to avoid or mitigate them and the corresponding testing plan. In 2020, we did not have any material cybersecurity breaches in our systems.​CLIMATE CHANGE​Peruvian operations: On April 17, 2018, the Peruvian government enacted Law N. 30754, establishing a Climate Change Framework. Through this law, promoting public and private investments in climate change management is declared to be of national interest. The law proposes to create an institutional framework to address climate change in Peru, outlining new measures, particularly with respect to climate change mitigation. It includes, for example, provisions regarding: increasing carbon capture and use of carbon sinks; afforestation and reforestation practices; land use changes; and sustainable systems of transportation, solid waste management, and energy systems. This is the first climate change framework law in Latin America to incorporate obligations from the Paris Agreement. Regulations to this law were enacted by Supreme Decree 013-2019, which was published on December 31, 2019 and are applicable to all Peruvian institutions and agencies. It is expected that further Peruvian regulations will be applicable to non-governmental entities. The Company anticipates initiating a multi-year process to adopt applicable reporting recommendations of the Task-Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) once new Peruvian climate change regulations applicable to non-governmental entities are implemented. The Company is committed to the environment and to managing climate-related impacts. The Company’s focus is to seek continuous improvement in the responsible use of natural resources while complying with strict applicable legal standards for prevention, mitigation, control and remediation of environmental impacts. Implementing continuous improvement in the Company’s processes improves efficiency in the use and consumption of energy, water, and other natural resources.​Mexican operations: Grupo Mexico, the indirect parent of SCC has issued sustainability reports under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for more than 10 years. Grupo Mexico also participates in different Mexican and international reporting programs such as the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) Mexico Program and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). In 2013, GHG and CDP signed a memorandum of understanding to work on aligning their reporting frameworks. Grupo Mexico’s 2018 CDP questionnaire included responses to the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure or TCFD concerns. In compliance with the 2012 Mexican Climate Change Law, Grupo Mexico’s GHG emissions are reported and verified independently. Grupo Mexico’s Sustainability Reports, which disclose inventories of GHG emissions, can be found at “https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/development.aspx”. On October 18, 2017, Grupo Mexico was selected to join the S&P Sustainability Indices MILA Pacific Alliance (DJSI MILA).

The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings in each period prior to settlement. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales.​Foreign currency exchange rate risk:​Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Given that our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements.

1001838,SCCO,SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/,2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” “Southern Copper,” “the Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results.​This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business—Cautionary Statement.”​EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW​Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales and our principal operations are in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. ​We believe we hold one of the world’s largest copper reserves and resources positions. As of December 31, 2021, our copper mineral reserves, calculated at a copper price of $3.30 per pound, totaled 93,497 million pounds of contained copper, at the following locations:​​​​Copper contained in ore reserves Million poundsMexican open‑pit 24,954Peruvian operations 50,072Development projects 18,471Total 93,497​Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following:​●Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 81.0% of our revenues came from the sale of copper, 8.0% from molybdenum, 5.0% from silver, 3.0% from zinc, and 3.0% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials.​●Copper: In the last quarter of 2021, the LME copper price increased from an average of $3.25 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $4.40 (+35.4%). Currently, we are seeing prices in the range of $4.40 to $4.50 per pound, still higher than the 2021 average of $4.23 per pound and bodes a positive outlook for the Company. We believe the following factors are influencing the market:​●The most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market balance for 2022.83 Table of Contents●This assumes a growth in demand of 3% in 2022, particularly in terms of cathode consumption in the U.S. and Europe. An economic slowdown is expected in China, with growth estimated at 5.1% (according to the World Bank) due to its real estate troubles and the impact of the Omicron variant. ●The combined inventories of the LME, Comex, Shanghai and Bonded warehouses remain at very low levels. The combined sum of these inventories fell from 569,000 tonnes in September 2021 to 369,000 tonnes at the end of December 2021; a 35% reduction. This unusually low inventory represents about one week of consumption.●The uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the world supply.​●Molybdenum: It represented approximately 9.6% of our sales in 2021. Molybdenum prices averaged $15.51 per pound in 2021, compared to $8.57 in 2020, a 81.0% increase.​Molybdenum is mainly used to produce special alloys of stainless steel that require significant hardness, corrosion and heat resistance. A new use for this metal is in lubricants and sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production.​●Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.3% of our sales in 2021.​●Zinc: Average zinc prices increased by 32.0% in 2021 compared with 2020. We believe zinc has very good long-term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption and expected production. Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales in 2021.​●Production: For 2022, we expect to produce 922,000 tonnes of copper, a decrease of 3.8% compared to 2021; as production will still be affected by a temporary reduction in ore grade and recovery at our Peruvian operations.​We expect our copper production to recover by 2023 and reach 992,000 tonnes of production as we get Peruvian production back on track and generate new production on our Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista-Zinc Concentrator projects. ​We also expect to produce 25,100 tonnes of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 17.2% compared to 2021 production levels. In 2022, we expect to produce 19.0 million ounces of silver, in line with 2021 production. Additionally, we expect to produce 71,200 tonnes of zinc from our mines, up 6.3% from 2021 production level. ​●Capital investments: Capital investments were $892.3 million for 2021. This is 50.7% higher than in 2020, and represented 26.3% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan whose goal is to increase our copper volume production to 1.8 million tonnes by the end of this decade.​For 2022, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,542.4 million.​COVID-19​The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide is not yet known and, accordingly, the magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future operating results is still uncertain. However, we believe we are beginning a new stage in the COVID-19 crisis, where outbreaks will be better controlled worldwide, which, we hope, will bode well for a strong recovery across the globe in the near future. Senior Management continues to actively monitor the global situation´s effect on the Company´s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce and is focusing principally on the health, safety and well-being of our employees, their families and the communities where we have operations. As of December 31, 2021, the strong global economic recovery has generated significant challenges for the global shipping industry, which have led to congestion at ports, shortage of containers and a lack of space on ships. This situation has caused the Company to experience some delays in the 84 Table of Contentsreception of imported materials as well as in the shipment of its products and receivable collections. This, however, has had no material impact on the financial position of the Company.​Considering the market outlook previously described, we have a positive view for the copper market in the near future.​The Company maintains a solid financial position and performance level. We believe this has allowed and will continue to allow us to deal with the effects of the pandemic in a way that prevents adverse material effects on our operations and financial results.

Our COVID-19 emergency protocol has reinforced preventive measures such as disinfecting, clinical monitoring before work, cleaning and sanitizing of work areas and respect for social distancing. We have also restricted the access of contractors, suppliers and personnel to our facilities if visits are not indispensable and enforced multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to COVID-19 by imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings and urging frequent hand washing, as well as adhering to all other health, safety and social distancing measures required by governmental authorities. ​For the full year 2021, our production facilities in Mexico and Peru were working at approximately 95% of their production capacity. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 96% of the workforce in Mexico and 74% of the workforce in Peru was working on site or at home under strict safety measures; the remaining labor force was not working, including all individuals at high risk due to age and/or preexisting medical conditions. We have also fully restored exploration activities at all of our locations.​The Company has launched several programs and initiatives in all of the regions where we operate to help communities combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In Peru, a partnership was established with the government in July 2021 to help vaccinate 40% of the population in the five regions where Southern Copper Corporation has operations (Apurimac, Arequipa, Cajamarca, Moquegua and Tacna). The Company donated over $2.45 million to help build, modernize, equip and operate vaccination centers. In the context of this partnership, more than one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in these five regions of Peru. This achievement surpassed our intial goal of administering 850 thousand doses and reached 48% of the target population. As of December 31, 2021, 96.1% of our workforce was fully vaccinated against COVID-19.​In addition, Minera Mexico has invested approximately $600,000 to purchase and operate a molecular laboratory for PCR tests in the community of Cananea, Sonora. This facility is offering testing to members of the community and beneficiaries of the Federal Public Health System. The federal healthcare authority is currently using the Company 85 Table of Contentsfacilities as vaccination sites, where Minera México’s personnel are providing medical support, food and technical assistance to register vaccination in the official portal of the Mexican Federal Government. ​KEY MATTERS​Below, we discuss several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program.​Earnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2021 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​ ​ Variance​​2021 2020 2019 2021 - 2020 2020 - 2019Copper price LME​​ 4.23​​ 2.80​​ 2.72​​ 1.43 ​ 0.08Pounds of copper sold​​ 2,052.9​​ 2,305.9​​ 2,173.8​​ (253.0) ​ 132.1Net sales​$ 10,934.1​$ 7,984.9​$ 7,285.6​$ 2,949.2​$ 699.3Operating income​$ 6,065.1​$ 3,120.7​$ 2,753.0​$ 2,944.4​$ 367.7Income before income taxes​$ 5,696.8​$ 2,745.8​$ 2,426.5​$ 2,951.0​$ 319.3Net income attributable to SCC​$ 3,397.1​$ 1,570.4​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,826.7​$ 84.6Earnings per share​$ 4.39​$ 2.03​$ 1.92​$ 2.36​$ 0.11Dividends per share​$ 3.20​$ 1.50​$ 1.60​$ 1.70​$ (0.10)​Net sales in 2021 of $10.9 billion were the highest in our history and exceeded those recorded in 2020 by $2,949.2 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+51.1% - LME), molybdenum (+81.0%), silver (+22.1%) and zinc (+32.0%) prices; this effect was partially offset by lower copper (-11.0%), silver (-14.1%) and zinc (-12.6%) sales volumes, which were mainly attributable to lower production and a decrease in sales of copper purchased from third parties. Net sales in 2020 of $8.0 billion exceeded those recorded in 2019 by $699.3 million. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+6.1%), molybdenum (+12.7%) and silver (+8.8%) sales volumes, as well as higher copper (+2.9%) and silver (+27.6%) prices; this effect was partially offset by lower molybdenum (-24.0%) prices.​The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion. In 2021, cost of sales decreased by $35.4 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $30.4 million. The decrease in cost of sales in 2021 was mainly due to a significant decrease in the cost of metals purchased from third parties; which was partially offset by increases in fuel, power and operating contractors costs. In 2020, cost of sales increased by $323.4 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion increased by $11.2 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2020 was mainly due to an increase in the cost of metals purchased from third parties and a decrease in the capitalization of leachable material. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of diesel and fuel.​Net income attributable to SCC in 2021 was 116.3% higher than reported in 2020; this was mainly due to higher metal prices and our strict cost control measures. Net income attributable to SCC in 2020 was 5.7% higher than reported in 2019; this was mainly due to higher sales volumes and to higher copper and silver prices.​​86 Table of ContentsProduction: The table below contains mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2021:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2021 - 2020​2020 - 2019 ​​2021 2020 2019 Volume %​Volume % Copper (in million pounds) 2,112.5 2,207.6 2,191.0 (95.1) (4.3)% 16.6 0.8%Molybdenum (in million pounds) 66.7 66.7 59.3 — —% 7.4 12.5%Zinc (in million pounds) 147.6 152.0 163.0 (4.4) (2.9)% (11.0) (6.7)%Silver (in million ounces) 19.0 21.5 20.3 (2.5) (12.0)% 1.2 5.9%​The table below contains copper production data from each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2021:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2021 - 20202020 - 2019 Copper (in million pounds):​2021 2020 2019 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 505.7 562.4 568.8 (56.7) (10.1)% (6.4) (1.1)%Cuajone 372.6 371.8 344.8 0.8 0.2% 27.0 7.8%La Caridad 282.4 298.8 293.4 (16.4) (5.5)% 5.4 1.8%Buenavista 932.6 951.9 965.8 (19.3) (2.0)% (13.9) (1.4)%IMMSA 19.2 22.7 18.2 (3.5) (15.4)% 4.5 24.7%Total mined copper 2,112.5 2,207.6 2,191.0 (95.1) (4.3)% 16.6 0.8%​2021 compared to 2020:​Copper mine production in 2021 decreased 4.3% to 2,112.5 million pounds, from 2,207.6 million pounds in 2020. This decrease was due to a decrease in production at the Toquepala mine (-10.1%; lower grades and recoveries), a decrease in production at the La Caridad mine (-5.5%; lower ore grades), a decrease in production at the Buenavista operations (-2.0%; lower ore grades). This was offset by a slight increase in production at the Cuajone mine (+0.2%).​Molybdenum production maintained the same level in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increase in production at our Toquepala (+6.2%) operations; this was offset by a decrease in production at our Buenavista (-4.4%), La Caridad (-3.2%) and Cuajone (-0.8%) mines.​Zinc production decreased 2.9% in 2021, driven by decreases in production at our Santa Barbara (-22.1%) and Charcas (-11.0%) operations due to lower ore grades; this was partially offset by an increase in production at our San Martin (+4.3%) mine.​Mined silver production decreased 12.0% in 2021 compared to the level recorded in 2020; this was mainly due to a decrease in production at our Toquepala (-19.7%), IMMSA (-17.5%), Buenavista (-14.0%) and La Caridad (-1.7%) operations, which was partially offset by an increase in production at the Cuajone (+12.1%) mine.​2020 compared to 2019:​Copper mine production in 2020 increased 0.8% to 2,207.6 million pounds, up from 2,191.0 million pounds in 2019. This increase was due to:​●Higher production at the Cuajone mine (+7.8%), which was driven by an increase in ore grades and recoveries. ●Higher production at the La Caridad mine (+1.8%).●Higher production at the IMMSA operations (+24.6%), which was attributable to an increase in ore grades.​Molybdenum production increased 12.5% in 2020 compared to the level in 2019 due to an increase in production at our Toquepala (+37.7%), Cuajone (+28.6%) and La Caridad (+3.2%) operations; this was partially offset by a decrease in production at our Buenavista (-10.6%) mine.87 Table of ContentsZinc production decreased 6.8% in 2020, which was driven by a decrease in ore grades and in production at our Santa Eulalia (-96.0%) and Los Charcas (-5.0%) operations; this was partially offset by an increase in production at our San Martin (+151.0%) mine, which restored production to full capacity at the end of the third quarter of 2019.​Mined silver production increased 6.2% in 2020 compared to the level recorded in 2019; this was mainly due to an increase in production at our Cuajone (+8.8%), La Caridad (+16.4%) and IMMSA (+15.0%) operations, which was partially offset by a decrease in production at the Toquepala (-2.4%) and Buenavista (-3.6%) mines.​Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” on page 113. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additional exclusions from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we believe is one of the lowest of all copper-producing companies of similar size.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to covering part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost.​We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address areas of concern within operating management. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry to determine whether to move forward or not in the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile.88 Table of ContentsOur operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2021:​Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021 - 2020​2020 - 2019 ​​2021 2020 2019 Variance % Variance % Total operating cash cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,357.4​$ 2,923.7​$ 3,230.9​$ 433.7 14.8% $ (307.2) (9.5)%Total by‑product revenues​$ (1,997.7)​$ (1,455.9)​$ (1,359.2)​$ (541.8) 37.2% (96.7) 7.1%Total operating cash cost net of by‑product revenues​$ 1,359.7​$ 1,467.8​$ 1,871.7​$ (108.1) (7.4)% $ (403.9) (21.6)%Total pounds of copper produced(2)​ 2,041.7​ 2,136.1​ 2,133.3​ (94.4) (4.4)% 2.8 0.1%Operating cash cost per pound before by‑product revenues​$ 1.64​$ 1.37​$ 1.52​$ 0.27 19.7% $ (0.15) (9.9)%By‑products per pound revenues​$ (0.97)​$ (0.68)​$ (0.64)​$ (0.29) 42.6% $ (0.04) 6.3%Operating cash cost per pound net of by‑product revenues​$ 0.67​$ 0.69​$ 0.88​$ (0.02) (2.9)% $ (0.19) (21.6)%(1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 113 for reconciliation to GAAP measure.(2)Net of metallurgical losses.​2021 compared to 2020:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2021 was 19.7% higher than that recorded in 2020. This result was mainly attributable to an increase in production costs and to the unit cost effect generated by a decrease in pounds of copper produced. Our cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues for 2021 was 2.9% below that seen for the same period of 2020 and was mainly attributable to an increase in by-product revenue credits, which was partially offset by an uptick in production costs.​2020 compared to 2019:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2020 was 9.9% lower than that recorded in 2019. This reduction is mainly attributable to a temporary decrease in production costs, as some operating, stripping and maintenance costs were reduced or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues for 2020 was 21.6% below that seen for the same period of 2019 and was also attributable to the temporary decrease in production costs outlined above.​Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver.​We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. For instance, during the period from January 2012 through December 2021, the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement price varied from a low of $1.96 per pound in 2016 to a record high of $4.86 per pound in 2021, and the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of $4.46 per pound in 2015 to a high of $20.01 per pound in 2021. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, as described further in Item 1A Risk Factors. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments.​89 Table of ContentsFor 2022, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved; 2021 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects relative to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Copper Molybdenum Zinc SilverChange in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce)​$ 0.10​$ 1.00​$ 0.10​$ 1.00Change in net earnings (in millions)​$ 119.4​$ 33.6​$ 14.5​$ 11.3​Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines and several industrial processing facilities.​Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 19 “Segment and Related Information” of the consolidated financial statements.​Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, we believe these changes have had no material effect on our results and financial position. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information.​Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $892.3 million in 2021, $592.2 million in 2020 and $707.5 million in 2019. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments.​90 Table of ContentsThe table below contains information on our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2021 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020 2019Peruvian projects:​​​​​​​​​Toquepala expansion project​$ 21.8​$ 5.1​$ 41.1Quebrada Honda dam expansion​ 86.3​ 30.9​ 1.6Relocation of facilities at Toquepala​ 23.8​ 6.6​ 0.3Toquepala mine truck acquisition​ —​ 9.7​ —Fresh water pipeline replacement at Suches​ 6.2​ 14.3​ —Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam​ 0.8​ 0.4​ 1.0Ilo sulfuric acid plant N°1 modification​ 0.2​ 2.0​ 5.1Building of the containment dike N°4 at Quebrada Santallana​​ 6.5​​ 9.5​​ —Other projects​ 28.8​ 21.5​ 51.5Sub‑total projects​ 174.4​ 100.0​ 100.6Maintenance and replacement​ 150.6​ 109.4​ 216.3Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ (4.1)​ (14.4)​ 33.2Total Peruvian expenditures​ 320.9​ 195.0​ 350.1Mexican projects:​ ​​ ​​​​New Buenavista concentrator​ 18.9​ 68.3​ 1.0Buenavista Zinc project​​ 126.1​​ 58.4​​ 1.2Pilares Mine​​ 30.9​​ 33.4​​ —Expansion of mine pit at Buenavista​ 24.6​ 23.9​ —Lime plant - Sonora​​ 30.7​​ 9.3​​ 1.4Solutions system improvements of Tinajas​ 0.7​ 10.0​ 6.0Quebalix IV​ 2.8​ 0.1​ 0.7New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine​ 59.7​ 27.0​ 35.8Over elevation of tailings deposit N° 7 at La Caridad mine​ 1.4​ 11.0​ 25.4Sonora River water restitution system in Moritas Basin​ —​ —​ 1.8San Martin mine restoration​​ 20.7​​ 21.1​​ 48.9Other projects​ 59.2​ 17.9​ 84.2Sub‑total projects​ 375.7​ 280.4​ 206.4Maintenance and replacement​ 184.0​ 132.5​ 148.6Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ 11.7​ (15.7)​ 2.4Total Mexican expenditures​ 571.4​ 397.2​ 357.4Total capital investments​$ 892.3​$ 592.2​$ 707.5​In 2022, we plan to invest $1,542.4 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following:​Projects in Mexico:​Buenavista Zinc - Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tonnes of zinc and 20,000 tonnes of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Procurement has progressed 96% and all the main equipment is on site. Additionally, construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits. The project´s budget is $413 million, and we expect to initiate operations in 2023. As of December 31, 2021, we had invested $217 million in this project. When completed, we anticipate that this new facility will double the Company’s zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. ​Pilares - Sonora: This project, located six kilometers from La Caridad, will be developed as an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad 91 Table of Contentscopper concentrator. This will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade (combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with 0.34% from La Caridad). The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expect the project to begin production in the second half of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had invested $75.9 million in this project.​El Pilar - Sonora: This is a low-capital intensity copper development project strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tonnes of ore with an average copper grade of 0.301%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tonnes of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. We estimate a development investment of approximately $310 million. The results from experimental pads in leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. We expect this project to start production in 2023 with an expected mine life of 13 years. The basic engineering study is finished and the Company continues developing project and site environmental activities.​Lime plant - Sonora: As part of our cost improvement projects, we are building a new lime plant with a production capacity of 600 metric tonnes per day, which will be the largest lime plant of Mexico. This facility will allow us to reduce to approximately 50% our current lime cost at our Mexican operations. The total budget for the plant is $63 million, of which we have spent $41 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect this project initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022.​The San Martin mine recovery program. After eleven years of illegal stoppage, we resumed control of the San Martin mine in August 2018. The San Martin facilities deteriorated during this period but we made a major renovation and restarted operations during the second quarter of 2019. Currently, the mine has 200,000 tonnes of ore and the concentrator has initiated production. In 2020, we produced 14,361 tonnes of zinc, 2.8 million ounces of silver, 3,601 tonnes of copper, and 1,425 tonnes of lead. As of December 2021, the Company had completed most of the rehabilitation plan to restore operations at the San Martin mine with a total expense of approximately $90.5 million; the mine has since reached full operating capacity.​Projects in Peru:​Quebrada Honda dam expansion – Tacna: This project aims to enlarge the main and lateral dams in Quebrada Honda and includes the relocation of some facilities due to dam growth and implementation of other facilities for water recovery, among other factors. As of December 31, 2021, construction and pre-commissioning activities are in progress with work on three fronts. This project has a total budget of $140.0 million, of which we had committed $6.8 million and invested $114.6 million as of December 31, 2021.​Tia Maria - Arequipa: On July 8, 2019, we were granted the construction permit for this 120,000 ton annual SX-EW copper greenfield project with a total capital budget of $1,400 million. The Government awarded the permit after completing an exhaustive review process, complying with all established regulatory requirements and addressing all observations raised. The challenges surrounding the construction permit were overcome when on October 30, 2019, the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines ratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project.​The Company has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality-of-life in the region. We also have promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.​On January 7, 2021, the mayor of the Islay province (Arequipa, Peru) awarded a City Diploma to SPCC in recognition of the Company’s efforts to assist the population of Islay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, SPCC also provided a portable oxygen plant to a local hospital and financed a COVID monitoring unit that aided more than 7,000 people in 2021. This year, SPCC fortified its relation with the regional government and successfully overcame its opposition to project initiation. This new consensus was reflected in an agreement for “works for taxes” for projects relative to health facilities and roads. Our efforts to ensure the current and long-term welfare of the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project were recognized by several local associations, which sent letters to the National Government to 92 Table of Contentsrequest project initiation. In July 2021, the Ministry of Energy and Mines sent a missive to Southern Copper recognizing its progress in securing social acceptance of the Tia Maria project.​We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs (3,600 direct and 5,400 indirect) that we expect to generate during Tia Maria’s construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day one of our operations, we will generate significant contributions to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.​We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru´s economy and, consequently, take the necessary steps to provide SCC with adequate support to initiate construction.​This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry due to their technical process with no emissions released into the atmosphere. ​Potential projects:​We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy, market conditions or the COVID-19 pandemic. ​El Arco - Baja California: This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with mineral reserves of over 1.3 billion tonnes with an ore grade of 0.39%, 0.14 0.14 grams of gold per ton and 1.8 grams of silver per ton, and 140 million tonnes of leach material with an ore grade of 0.27%. This project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined concentrator and SX-EW operations, with an estimated production capacity of 190,000 tonnes of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. The project has an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The Company has started the baseline study and it is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area; this process was completed in 2020.​Los Chancas—Apurimac: This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates include 52 million tonnes of sulfide indicated mineral resources with a copper grade of 0.59%, as well as 98 million tonnes of oxide indicated mineral resources with a copper content of 0.45%. Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tonnes of copper and 7,500 tonnes of molybdenum anually. The estimated capital investment is $2,600 million and the project is expected to be in operation in 2027. In 2020, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities. In 2021, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities and we worked in the environmental impact assessment for the project.​Michiquillay Project—Cajamarca: On June 12, 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract and made an initial payment of $12.5 million for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. In June 2021, the Company paid an additional $12.5 million to acquire the project. The Company has created a multidisciplinary management team to plan the development of this project. As part of this plan, the Company has established contact with the local and regional authorities and communities in order to promote programs for the sustainable development of the area. In 2020, we continued to develop social and environmental programs for the local communities. On September 3, 2021 the Company signed a Social Agreement with the Michiquillay Community and on November 12, 2021, the Company signed a Social Agreement with the Encañada Community. Additionally, on October 1, 2021 the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the semi-detailed Environmental Impact Study for the project. 93 Table of ContentsThe Social Agreements with the Michiquillay and the Encañada communities represent an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residents of those communities via our strong social programs and backed by a solid framework for technical work at the project level. These events are important steps that will allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in the first semester of 2022. ​Michiquillay is a world class mining project with estimated inferred mineral resources of 2,288 million tonnes with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years, at a competitive cash-cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2028 and that Michiquillay will become one of Peru´s largest copper mines. The project will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region; generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments.​The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate.​ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) ​We believe acting in a responsible and transparent manner in the social, economic and environmental fields is essential to a sustainable development for the Company and the regions where we operate. In Southern Copper Corporation we are committed to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Compact principles. Caring for the environment, tackling climate change, respecting human rights, and having a responsible production are at the center of our sustainability strategy, which is comprised of specific goals and objectives in areas such as water management, climate change and mining waste, human talent, occupational safety and health, labor relations, and community development, among others. ​The Company has updated a range of sustainability-related corporate policies, which are publicly disclosed on Grupo Mexico’s website: https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/Politicsds.aspx. These policies, which are applicable to SCC and its subsidiaries, formalize our vision, commitments and objectives to promote sustainable development and generate shared value for our stakeholders. ​The Company’s performance with respect to these commitments and ESG matters is reported annually in the sustainability report of our indirect parent company, Grupo Mexico. Information and performance of SCC can be found in the sustainability reports. These have followed the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI) since 2006, and since 2020 the sustainability reports also have included the metrics of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).​We are committed to improving our ESG performance by adopting best practices. Southern Copper Corporation has been consistent in increasing its scores on the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) of S&P since 2018, achieving a score of 61 in 2021. As a result, the Company has been integrated for the third consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index MILA (which stands for “Integrated Latin-American Markets” in Spanish). SCC’s 2021 score was 79% higher than the Mining and Metals industry average. Additionally, the Company was included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2022 for being a top performer in this industry. The company achieved good performances in issues such as business ethics, labor practice, human rights, climate strategy, water management, social impact on communities, corporate citizenship and philanthropy, operational ecoefficiencies, environmental and social reporting, among others.​HEALTH AND SAFETY​At Southern Copper Corporation, the health and safety of our employees is what matters the most. Therefore, respecting human rights and taking care of the health, safety and well being of our employees and contractors is a core value and is 94 Table of Contentsan essential part of our activities. Safety at work is not negotiable at SCC; it is everyone’s responsibility and is a condition for employment.​The Company seeks to continue strengthening operational risk management processes by implementing preventive and corrective measures. For instance, traffic management plans have been implemented in all open pit mines, haul trucks have been equipped with antifatigue systems, and health and safety performance expectations have been included in suppliers and contractors’ code of conduct. ​Two business units of SCC were recognized by the Mining Chamber of Mexico for obtaining top safety performance in their respective categories in 2020. La Caridad mine received the “Silver Helmet” award (“Casco de Plata”) in the category for open-pit mining operations with more than 500 employees, and the refinery and metallurgical plants received the same distinction in the category for metallurgical plants and smelters with up to 500 employees. In 2021, the Company also updated its health & safety policy and key commitments, as disclosed on Grupo Mexico’s website.​COMMUNITY OUTREACH ​For Southern Copper Corporation it is our priority to be a good neighbor in the localities close to our operations. Working together with the communities, we have the opportunity to collaborate and forge a path based on our common objectives related to social and economic development, while supporting the fulfillment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. For this reason, we believe that community outreach must be based on transparency and trust, promoting long-lasting ties.​We have implemented several sustainable development policies designed to integrate the Company´s operations with local communities in areas where we operate. Some of the relevant policies include the General Policy for Sustainable Development; a Community Outreach Policy; a General Policy of Respect for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Communities, a Human Rights Policy Statement. These policies focus on creating permanent and positive relationships to generate optimal social conditions and promote sustainable development in the areas where we operate. We continue to make significant expenditures for community programs. ​Since 2018, the Interamerican Bank of Development (BID) has made reference to SCC’s community outreach model as one of the best practices in the extractive industry in Latin America. In 2021, BID has reaffirmed this once again, and pointed out the Company’s success in adapting its community outreach programs in the context of the global pandemic through the “Casa Grande Virtual” strategy implemented. Additionally, the government of Sonora recognized Southern Copper Corporation for being a “Culturally Responsible Company” for the voluntary initiatives implemented to promote and safeguard the state’s history, culture and traditions. Three of the community programs launched by the Company were pinpointed as particularly relevant: the Itinerant Documentary Cinema Workshop, which led to the creation of over 200 films; the funding provided for organizing the “Festival Alfonso Ortiz Tirado” (“FAOT”) in Nacozari and Cananea; and the creation of Youth Orchestras, which has led to the creation of six orchestras and four choirs . These educational music programs are offered to more than 2,100 children in the communities surrounding our mining operations in Mexico and Peru.​For additional information on our community programs, refer to Corporate Social Responsibility under Note 13 “Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements. For further information on our disclosure on Human Capital Resources, see the section included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.​ENVIRONMENT​Southern Copper Corporation seeks to attend to the needs of future generations by promoting a development that benefits us all, today and tomorrow. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our environmental performance and to promoting the adoption of the best environmental practices in our operations in order to contribute to the transition towards a green economy. We are also committed to preserving and improving the environment by implementing actions to generate a positive impact on biodiversity through our operations. To fulfil this commitment, which is outlined in the Company’s Environmental Policy, we have developed action plans for biodiversity management that are aligned with the guide for Good Practice Guidance for Mining and Biodiversity published by the International 95 Table of ContentsCouncil on Mining and Metals (ICMM). We believe these plans further improve the Company’s capacity to implement effective mitigation measures and contribute to the preservation and improvement of the environment at our operations. Furthermore, as part of our commitment to certify our environmental systems with the international norm ISO 14001, in 2021 the business units of La Caridad and the Limestone Plant in México obtained their ISO 14001 certification.​Additionally, Southern Copper Corporation has also committed to embrace the Copper Mark, a voluntary assurance framework involving onsite verifications by an independent auditor, that aims to promote responsible production practices in the copper industry that contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The La Caridad open pit mine and the Sonora Metallurgical Complex (smelter and refinery) are the first business units to start the certification process. Throughout our operations we strive to protect the environment as well as the health, safety and human rights of our people, stakeholders and communities where we operate. SCC’s commitment with the Copper Mark is a testament to our commitment to transparency and responsible production practices. Through this third-party verification, our stakeholders can be confident that the copper we produce upholds the highest possible sustainability standards.​CLIMATE CHANGE​SCC recognizes the importance and urgency of tackling climate change, and the Company is committed to support the objective of the Paris Agreement on climate change, preserve the environment, minimize the environmental footprint of our operations, and efficiently manage climate-related risks and opportunities. We recognize that climate change will likely influence our strategy in various ways, and we aim to meet the expectations of the global business trends that are moving to demand products with lower carbon footprint. Our focus is to seek continuous improvement in the responsible use of natural resources while complying with applicable legal standards for prevention, mitigation, control and remediation of environmental impacts. ​The Company is committed to continually improve its management performance with respect to the aforementioned issues, which is why it has initiated a multi-year process to align its disclosures on climate change with the TCFD recommendations. As a result, beginning in 2020, Grupo Mexico’s Sustainable Development Report includes sections on climate-related risks and opportunities, and more detailed information on climate targets, strategy and governance mechanisms, as well as new emissions and energy metrics informed by SASB standards. The report can be accessed at https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/development.aspx. We are referring our investors to Grupo Mexico's internet site for details on the aforementioned initiatives for informative purposes only. We do not intend for this internet link to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this Report on Form 10-K.​Since 2016, Grupo Mexico has been participating annually in the evaluation on Climate Change of CDP (formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project). In 2021, its score improved two levels from C to B, which is superior to the Metal, smelting, refining & forming average, the averages in the region where the Company operates, and the global average. The Company’s operational greenhouse gases emissions have decreased significantly over the last three years, and we strive to further reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and products by, among other things, increasing the use of renewable energy and implementing resources efficiency measures intended to minimize the consumption of energy, water, and other natural resources. Thanks to our new 168 MW wind farm Fenicias in northern Mexico, the Company’s electricity consumption coming from renewable sources is expected to surpass 25%. ​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.​Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other 96 Table of Contentsinformation available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: mineral reserves, revenue recognition, ore stockpiles on leach pads and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, determination of discount rates related to the operating lease liabilities, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.​Mineral Reserves: For ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $3.30 per pound for copper and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term and are based on internal estimates for the curves of long-term metal prices.​Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes in our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. ​Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory on our balance sheet. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method.​On January 1, 2020, the Company aligned its capitalization method for its Peruvian and Mexican operations to capitalize based on the allocation of copper content recoverable between ore and leach material. In addition, inventory consumption is now valued at the average unit cost, instead of the declining percentages of recovery method used previously. As a result of these changes, during 2020 the value of capitalized material decreased by $196.4 million and consumption decreased by $29.3 million when compared to the previous capitalization method.​Management has evaluated ASC 250-10 and considered appropriate guidance to conclude that the aforementioned classifies as a change in accounting estimate, and therefore should affect accounting books prospectively. Management believes that this new method will result in a more accurate valuation of this material.Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. In 2020, the Company made a change in the estimate for the asset retirement obligation for its Mexican operations, mainly due to a detailed review of the closing activities required for each facility. The effect of this change was an increase in the asset retirement obligation of $269.3 million, which was recorded in December 2020.​Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to the consolidated financial statements included herein.​Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in a few cases, in a period that can exceed three months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The 97 Table of Contentsprovisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7).​Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted.​A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.​The Company’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties can arise in the application of complex tax regulations. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including audits and negotiations with tax authorities. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, final taxes paid may be materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If its estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, or payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be more than the recorded amounts, the difference would be recognized in the period when the Company determines the change.​Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, which reflect what we believe, for impairment test purposes, is the lower range of the current price environment. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound, showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.8 to 5.7 times such carrying amount.​In recent years, our assumptions for long-term average prices resulted in stricter evaluations for impairment analysis than using the three year average prices for copper and molybdenum prices. Should this situation change in the future with three-year average prices falling below the long-term price assumption, we would assess the need to use the three-year average prices in our evaluations. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment compared to fair value.​Leases: In 2019, the Company adopted the new leases standard and it resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations on the Company´s balance sheet. After the analysis of this standard, the Company concluded that all of its existing lease contracts are operating lease contracts. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation by the Company to make lease payments that arise from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the inception date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease contracts do not provide an implicit 98 Table of Contentsrate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the inception date to determine the present value of lease payments.​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Statement of Earnings Data​2021 2020 2019​2021 - 2020 2020 - 2019Net sales​$ 10,934.1​$ 7,984.9​$ 7,285.6​$ 2,949.2​$ 699.3Operating costs and expenses​ (4,869.0)​ (4,864.2)​ (4,532.6)​ (4.8)​ (331.6)Operating income​ 6,065.1​ 3,120.7​ 2,753.0​ 2,944.4​ 367.7Non‑operating income (expense)​ (368.3)​ (374.9)​ (326.5)​ 6.6​ (48.4)Income before income taxes​ 5,696.8​ 2,745.8​ 2,426.5​ 2,951.0​ 319.3Income taxes​ (2,425.5)​ (1,237.9)​ (966.3)​ (1,187.6)​ (271.6)Deferred income taxes​ 126.3​ 63.5​ 21.0​ 62.8​ 42.5Equity earnings of affiliate​ 13.6​ 6.4​ 10.7​ 7.2​ (4.3)Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest​ (14.1)​ (7.4)​ (6.1)​ (6.7)​ (1.3)Net income attributable to SCC​$ 3,397.1​$ 1,570.4​$ 1,485.8​$ 1,826.7​$ 84.6​NET SALES​2021-2020: Net sales in 2021 were $10,934.1 million, compared to $7,984.9 million in 2020, which represented an increase of $2,949.2 million. This 36.9% increase was mainly the result of higher copper (+51.1% - LME), molybdenum (+81.0%), zinc (+32.0%) and silver (+22.1%) prices.

This debt is all denominated in dollars at fixed interest rates, weighed at 5.71%.​The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 44.4% as of December 31, 2021, compared to 47.4% as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the ratio of net debt to net capitalization was 27.1% as of December 31, 2021, compared to 35.2% as of December 31, 2020.​We define net debt as total debt, including current maturities, minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. We believe that net debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We define net capitalization as the sum of net debt and equity. We use the net debt to net capitalization ratio as measure of our indebtedness position and to determine how much debt we can take in addition to the use of the equity and of the balance sheet in general. We define total capitalization as the sum of the carrying values of our total debt, including current maturities and equity. A reconciliation of our net debt to net capitalization and total debt to total capitalization as included in the consolidated balance sheet is presented under the sub heading “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” below.​Please see Note 11 “Financing” for a discussion about the covenants requirements related to our long-term debt.​Capital Investment Program​A discussion of our capital investment program is an important part of understanding our liquidity and capital resources. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these capital investments from cash on hand, internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required. For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7.​CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS​As of December 31, 2021, our most significant contractual obligations include interest and principal on debt; workers’ participation, pension and post-retirement obligations, payments for operating leases, asset retirement obligations, and commitments for purchasing energy and for capital investment projects.​Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2021. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities.​Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers after final results are determined for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary are distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law.​Operating leases include lease payments for power generating facilities to MGE, vehicles and properties. Please refer to Note 9 “Leases” of the consolidated financial statements.110 Table of ContentsPension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit Plans” of the consolidated financial statements.​Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of closure and remediation costs for our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” of the consolidated financial statements.​In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (“MW”) with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (“Kallpa”), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, under which Kallpa will supply energy to the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and to other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first.​Additionally, we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments”.​Our long-term estimated power costs are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the Company has committed approximately $355.1 million for the development of its capital investment projects. These include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects and for our Peruvian expansion projects.​CYBERSECURITY​Our operations depend upon information technology systems that may be subject to disruption, damage or failure from different sources, including, without limitation, installation of malicious software, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks and defects in design. In recent years, cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have implemented appropriate preventative measures to mitigate potential risks by implementing an information security management system, which ensures implementing controls that are frequently reviewed and tested. ​On March 1, 2021, at approximately 02:00 hours Mexico City time, we experienced a Ransomware cyber-attack, which was operated by humans. This cyber-attack encrypted a total of 420 servers and pieces of personal equipment. However, due to the quick response of our IT team, our Enterprise Resource Planning software was not affected by the aforementioned attack.​After the attack, we immediately began a remediation and recovery process and completely restored the affected servers. So far, the forensic investigation has not identified any concrete evidence of information stolen during the attack. However, we maintain active lines of work in cyberintelligence and forensic investigation to continue monitoring the DarkWeb/DeepWeb and social networks to identify any publication or activity related to the Company; ensure that our systems infrastructure is safe and validate the technological controls affected during the attack. ​In March 2021, we appointed a new Head of Information Technology, who is implementing a new information security strategy to ensure business continuity based on processes (controls and corporate governance framework), technology and human capital (organizational culture). The areas of compliance, internal control, information technology and internal auditing work together on a permanent basis to create reference frameworks, risk management models and controls to implement the information security strategy and its programs.​Our information security strategy is being executed on a continuous basis. In July 2021, Grupo Mexico appointed a Chief Information Security Officer who has been actively involved in the development and implementation of this strategy. In addition, between July and September of 2021 we performed a cybernetic forensic analysis with the 111 Table of Contentsassistance of a specialized provider with global experience in this area. The recommendations received have already been integrated in current information security programs. The Company has set up a task force to oversee ongoing initiatives and to ensure that targets are met. We are actively following up on this matter with this task force, our internal audit team and will involve specialized third parties as needed.​As of December 31, 2021, we recorded $0.3 million in direct costs for maneuvers associated with the incident. In addition, for 2022 we have a non-material special budget to continue improvements in this area.112 Table of Contents​NON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION​Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 88) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021 2020 2019​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundCost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)​$ 3,894.4​$ 1.90​$ 3,929.8​$ 1.84​$ 3,606.4​$ 1.69Add:​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​ ​ ​Selling, general and administrative​ 125.2​ 0.06​ 126.2​ 0.06​ 131.8​ 0.06Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges​ (25.6)​ (0.01)​ 17.0​ 0.01​ 28.7​ 0.02Less:​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Workers’ participation​ (267.2)​ (0.13)​ (263.9)​ (0.13)​ (214.5)​ (0.10)Cost of metals purchased from third parties​ (225.8)​ (0.11)​ (495.2)​ (0.23)​ (263.4)​ (0.12)Royalty charge and other, net​ (158.6)​ (0.08)​ (171.6)​ (0.08)​ (125.7)​ (0.06)Inventory change​ 15.0​ 0.01​ (218.6)​ (0.10)​ 67.6​ 0.03Operating Cash Cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,357.4​$ 1.64​$ 2,923.7​$ 1.37​$ 3,230.9​$ 1.52Add:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ By‑product revenues(1)​ (1,974.8)​ (0.96)​ (1,375.9)​ (0.64)​ (1,307.3)​ (0.61)Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties​ (22.9)​ (0.01)​ (80.0)​ (0.04)​ (51.9)​ (0.03)Total by‑product revenues​ (1,997.7)​ (0.97)​ (1,455.9)​ (0.68)​ (1,359.2)​ (0.64)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating Cash Cost net of by‑product revenues​ 1,359.7​ 0.67​ 1,467.8​ 0.69​ 1,871.7​ 0.88​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total pounds of copper produced (in millions)​ 2,041.7​ ​ 2,136.1​ ​ 2,133.3​ (1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021 2020 2019​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundMolybdenum​$ (1,053.1)​$ (0.51)​$ (510.3)​$ (0.24)​$ (549.4)​$ (0.26)Silver​ (445.3)​ (0.22)​ (415.5)​ (0.19)​ (278.3)​ (0.13)Zinc​ (196.9)​ (0.10)​ (202.9)​ (0.10)​ (211.5)​ (0.10)Sulfuric Acid​ (164.6)​ (0.08)​ (135.9)​ (0.06)​ (158.8)​ (0.07)Gold​ (67.5)​ (0.03)​ (73.6)​ (0.03)​ (53.2)​ (0.03)Other​ (47.4)​ (0.02)​ (37.7)​ (0.02)​ (56.1)​ (0.02)Total​$ (1,974.8)​$ (0.96)​$ (1,375.9)​$ (0.64)​$ (1,307.3)​$ (0.61)​The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 171 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​113 Table of ContentsNet debt to net capitalization: Net debt to net capitalization as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020​Total debt​$ 6,547.6​$ 6,544.2​Cash and cash equivalents​ (3,002.0)​ (2,183.6)​Short‑term investments​ (486.9)​ (410.8)​Net debt​ 3,058.7​ 3,949.8​Net capitalization:​ ​ ​Net debt​ 3,058.7​ 3,949.8​Equity​ 8,207.8​ 7,276.0​Net capitalization​$ 11,266.5​$ 11,225.8​Net debt/net capitalization(*)​ 27.1% 35.2%(*)Represents net debt divided by net capitalization.​Total debt to total capitalization: Total debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:​​​​​​​​​​ 2021 2020​Total debt​$ 6,547.6​$ 6,544.2​Capitalization​ ​ ​Debt​ 6,547.6​ 6,544.2​Equity​ 8,207.8​ 7,276.0​Total capitalization​$ 14,755.4​$ 13,820.2​Total debt/total capitalization(*)​ 44.4% 47.4%(*)Represents debt divided by total capitalization.​114 Table of Contents​ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK​Commodity price risk:For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to “Metal Prices” in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report.​Open sales risk:Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings in each period prior to settlement. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales.​Foreign currency exchange rate risk:​Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Given that our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2021 are provided in the table below:​​​​​​​​​​ Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2021 2020 2019​Peru: ​Peruvian inflation rate 6.4% 2.0% 1.9%​​​​​​​​Initial exchange rate 3.624 3.317 3.379​Closing exchange rate 3.998 3.624 3.317​Appreciation/(devaluation) (10.3)% (9.3)% 1.8%​​​​​​​​Mexico: ​Mexican inflation rate 7.4% 3.2% 2.8%​​​​​​​​Initial exchange rate 19.949 18.845 19.683​Closing exchange rate 20.584 19.949 18.845​Appreciation/(devaluation) (3.2)% (5.9)% 4.3%​Change in monetary position:​Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2021, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows:​​​​​ Effect in net​ earnings​ ($ in millions)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ 50.5Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ (61.7)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ 7.5Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ (9.1)​The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated as of December 31, 2021.​115 Table of ContentsShort-term investments:​For additional information on our trading securities and available-for-sale investments, refer to Note 3 Short-term Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.​Derivative Instruments:​From time to time, we use derivative instruments to manage our cash flows exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate that the possibility exists that future activity will expose our future cash flows to deterioration. Derivative contracts for commodities are entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of the commodities that we use in our manufacturing process.​Cash Flow Hedges of Natural Gas​The Company’s objective in using natural gas derivatives is to protect the stability of natural gas costs and manage exposure to natural gas price increases. To protect natural gas costs from estimated price increases in the coming winter season, in the third quarter of 2021, the Company acquired two derivative instruments that began in November 2021 and end in March 2022.​Derivative instruments balances as of December 31, 2021, are as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​Call​Financial Swap​Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815​Option​Cash Settlement​Commodity contracts​​Natural gas​​Natural gas​Gas volume (MMBTUs)​​ 5,285,000​​ 5,285,000​Fixed price ($)​​ 0.55​​ 3.75​Total option premium (millions of $)​ 1.7​​N/A​Estimated fair value of assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2021 (millions of $)​ (0.9)​​ 0.1​(Favorable) unfavorable effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated Statement of Earnings (millions of $)​ 1.2​​ (3.0)​(Favorable) unfavorable effect in OCI - net of deferred income taxes (millions of $)​​ (0.6)​​(*)​(*) Less than $0.1 million.​The Company assessed these derivative instruments as Cash Flow Hedges. As such, the effective portions of said hedges are initially reported in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and are reclassified as earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portions of these derivatives would be reported in earnings during the current period.​As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any derivative instruments.​​116 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:09.365078

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to and should be read together with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “SCC,” “Southern Copper,” “the Company,” “our,” and “we”) on a consolidated basis for all periods. Our financial results may not be indicative of our future results.​This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See Item 1 “Business—Cautionary Statement.”​EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW​Business: Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world’s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales and our principal operations are in Peru and Mexico. We also have an active ongoing exploration program in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. ​We believe we hold one of the world’s largest copper reserves and resources positions. As of December 31, 2022, our copper mineral reserves, calculated at a copper price of $3.30 per pound, totaled 99,502 million pounds of contained copper, at the following locations:​​​​Copper contained in ore reserves Million poundsMexican open‑pit 34,941Peruvian operations 45,287Development projects 19,274Total 99,502​Outlook: Various key factors affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following:​●Sales structure: In the last three years, approximately 79.0% of our revenues have come from the sale of coppe; 10.0% from molybdenum; 5.0% from silver; 3.0% from zinc; and 3.0% from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid and other materials.​●Copper: In the last quarter of 2022, the LME copper price decreased from an average of $4.40 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $3.63 (-17.5%), reflecting concerns about a possible recession in the US and Europe, that were partially offset by good news on a possible Chinese recovery. Current prices for copper are over $4.10 per pound, reflecting a relatively more positive outlook for this market, due to the following factors:​●A reduction in global inflation, which may slow down or even stop the interest rate hike cycle led by the FED and the ECB.●The turnaround in China´s policies regarding COVID-19 after the government embraced proven practices. Stimulus measures have been implemented to shore up a weak real estate market.91 Table of Contents●The most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market in balance or a small surplus for 2023. This assumes a growth in demand of about 2-3% this year.●There is uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the global supply.●Inventories dropped and stood at 241,000 tonnes as of December 31, 2022. This level represents 3.5 days of consumption, which is extremely low. ​It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long-term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of low prices will be short-lived.​●Molybdenum: Represented approximately 11.9% of our sales in 2022. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.61 per pound in 2022, compared to $15.51 in 2021, a 20.0% increase.​Regarding this by-product, we believe that prices will be supported by global supply shortages and strong demand in China and the U.S.​●Silver: We believe that silver prices will have support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. Silver represented 4.3% of our sales in 2022.​●Zinc: Average zinc prices increased by 16.2% in 2022 compared with 2021. We consider zinc has very good long-term fundamentals due high levels of industrial consumption and expected production. Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales in 2022.​●Production: For 2023, we expect our copper production to reach 925,800 tonnes, an increase of 3.5% over final production in 2022. This growth will unfold as we get Peruvian production back on track and will be complemented by new production in our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista Zinc Concentrator projects.​We also expect to produce 22,200 tonnes of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 15.3% compared to 2022 production levels. In 2023, we expect to produce 20.5 million ounces of silver, and increase of 10.2% compared with 2022 production. Additionally, we expect to produce 116,800 tonnes of zinc from our mines, up 94.7% from 2022´s production level. This growth will be driven by production start-up at the Buenavista Zinc operations and by recovery at the IMMSA mines, where better ore grade areas have been identified. For 2024 and on we expect to produce over 200,000 tonnes per year.​●Capital investments: Capital investments were $948.5 million for 2022. This is 6.3% higher than in 2021, and represented 36.2% of net income. Our growth program to develop the full production potential of our Company is underway. We are currently developing a new organic growth plan whose goal is to increase our copper volume production to 1.7 million tonnes by the end of this decade.​For 2023, the Board of Directors approved a capital investment program of $1,099.6 million.​KEY MATTERS​Below, we discuss several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition. These matters include (i) earnings, (ii) production, (iii) “operating cash costs” as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program.92 Table of ContentsEarnings: The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2022 (in millions, except copper price and per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​ ​ ​ Variance​​2022 2021 2020 2022 - 2021 2021 - 2020Copper price LME​​ 4.00​​ 4.23​​ 2.80​​ (0.23) ​ 1.43Pounds of copper sold​​ 1,920.4​​ 2,052.9​​ 2,305.9​​ (132.5) ​ (253.0)Net sales​$ 10,047.9​$ 10,934.1​$ 7,984.9​$ (886.2)​$ 2,949.2Operating income​$ 4,435.8​$ 6,065.1​$ 3,120.7​$ (1,629.3)​$ 2,944.4Income before income taxes​$ 4,247.8​$ 5,696.8​$ 2,745.8​$ (1,449.0)​$ 2,951.0Net income attributable to SCC​$ 2,638.5​$ 3,397.1​$ 1,570.4​$ (758.6)​$ 1,826.7Earnings per share​$ 3.41​$ 4.39​$ 2.03​$ (0.98)​$ 2.36Dividends per share​$ 3.50​$ 3.20​$ 1.50​$ 0.30​$ 1.70​Net sales in 2022 of $10.0 billion were close to our historical high in 2021 of $10.9 million. This decrease was driven by lower copper (-6.5%), molybdenum (-13.4%) and silver (-1.9%) sales volumes, and by a drop in copper (-5.4% - LME) and silver (-13.6%) prices; this effect was slightly offset by an increase in zinc (+10.5%) sales volumes and by higher prices for molybdenum (+20.0%) and zinc (+16.2%). Net sales in 2021 of $10.9 billion were the highest in our history and exceeded those recorded in 2020 by $2,949.2 million. Please see Management´s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Matters, Earnings on the 2021 Form 10-K for details on variations between 2021 and 2020.​The two largest components of operating costs and expenses are cost of sales and depreciation, amortization and depletion. In 2022, cost of sales increased by $754.7 million and depreciation, amortization and depletion fell $9.7 million. The increase in cost of sales in 2022 was mainly due to a significant increase in fuel, energy and operating contractors costs, an increase in the cost of metals purchased from third parties, growth in workers participation; a drop in inventory consumption and foreign currency effects. Please see Management´s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Matters, Earnings on the 2021 Form 10-K for details on variations between 2021 and 2020.​Net income attributable to SCC in 2022 was 22.3% below 2021’s net income; this was mainly due to higher costs of sales and a slight reduction in sales volumes. Net income attributable to SCC in 2021 was 116.3% higher than the figure reported in 2020; this was mainly due to higher metal prices and our strict cost control measures.​Production: The table below contains mine production data of our Company for the three years ended December 31, 2022:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2022 - 2021​2021 - 2020 ​​2022 2021 2020 Volume %​Volume % Copper (in million pounds) 1,972.5 2,112.5 2,207.6 (140.0) (6.6)% (95.1) (4.3)%Molybdenum (in million pounds) 57.8 66.7 66.7 (8.9) (13.3)% — —%Zinc (in million pounds) 132.3 147.6 152.0 (15.3) (10.4)% (4.4) (2.9)%Silver (in million ounces) 18.6 19.0 21.5 (0.4) (2.1)% (2.5) (11.6)%​93 Table of ContentsThe table below contains copper production data from each of our mines for the three years ended December 31, 2022:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​2022 - 20212021 - 2020 Copper (in million pounds):​2022 2021 2020 Volume % Volume % Toquepala 444.2 505.7 562.4 (61.5) (12.2)% (56.7) (10.1)%Cuajone 309.4 372.6 371.8 (63.2) (17.0)% 0.8 0.2%La Caridad 246.5 282.4 298.8 (35.9) (12.7)% (16.4) (5.5)%Buenavista 952.3 932.6 951.9 19.7 2.1% (19.3) (2.0)%IMMSA 20.1 19.2 22.7 0.9 4.8% (3.5) (15.4)%Total mined copper 1,972.5 2,112.5 2,207.6 (140.0) (6.6)% (95.1) (4.3)%​2022 compared to 2021:​Copper mine production in 2022 fell 6.6% to 1,972.5 million pounds, down from 2,112.5 million pounds in 2021. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in production at the Cuajone mine (-17.0%; due to stoppage), a decrese in production at Toquepala mine (-12.2%; lower ore grades) and a drop in production at the La Caridad mine (-12.7%; lower ore grades). This was offset by a slight increase in production at the Buenavista operations (+2.1%; SX-EW production) and IMMSA unit (+4.8% higher ore grades)​Molybdenum production decreased 13.3% to 57.8 million pounds, down from 66.7 million punds in 2021. This decrease was due to a reduction in production at our Toquepala (-27.8%; lower grades), Cuajone (-13.5%; lower recovery) and La Caridad (-6.3%; lower recovery) mines; this was offset by an increase in production at our Buenavista operations (+2.8%).​Zinc production fell 10.4% in 2022, driven by decreases in production at our Charcas (-16.0%) and Santa Barbara (-11.0%) operations due to lower ore grades.​Mined silver production fell 2.1% in 2022 in YoY terms; this was mainly due to a decrease in production at our Toquepala (17.2%), Cuajone (-14.6%) and La Caridad (-6.3%) operations, which was partially offset by an increase in production at the Buenavista (+9.1%) and IMMSA (+2.4%) operations.​Please see Management´s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Matters, Production on the 2021 Form 10-K for details on variations between 2021 and 2020.​Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, “Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation” on page 118. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers’ participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers’ participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additional exclusions from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the 94 Table of Contentscharge. We believe these adjustments will allow our management and stakeholders to see a presentation of our controllable cash cost, which we believe is one of the lowest of all copper-producing companies of similar size.​We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to covering part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community’s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost.​We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address areas of concern within operating management. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project’s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry to determine whether to move forward or not in the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile.​Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined above, is presented in the table below for the three years ended December 31, 2022:​Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced(1)(In millions, except cost per pound and percentages)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022 - 2021​2021 - 2020 ​​2022 2021 2020 Value % Value % Total operating cash cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,825.7​$ 3,357.4​$ 2,923.7​$ 468.3 13.9% $ 433.7 14.8%Total by‑product revenues​$ (2,355.8)​$ (1,997.7)​$ (1,455.9)​$ (358.1) 17.9% (541.8) 37.2%Total operating cash cost net of by‑product revenues​$ 1,469.9​$ 1,359.7​$ 1,467.8​$ 110.2 8.1% $ (108.1) (7.4)%Total pounds of copper produced(2)​ 1,894.7​ 2,041.7​ 2,136.1​ (147.0) (7.2)% (94.4) (4.4)%Operating cash cost per pound before by‑product revenues​$ 2.02​$ 1.64​$ 1.37​$ 0.38 22.8% $ 0.27 19.7%By‑products per pound revenues​$ (1.24)​$ (0.97)​$ (0.68)​$ (0.27) 27.1% $ (0.29) 42.6%Operating cash cost per pound net of by‑product revenues​$ 0.78​$ 0.67​$ 0.69​$ 0.11 16.5% $ (0.02) (2.9)%(1)These are non-GAAP measures, see page 118 for reconciliation to GAAP measure.(2)Net of metallurgical losses.​2022 compared to 2021:​As seen in the table above, our per pound cash cost before by-product revenues in 2022 was 22.8% higher than that recorded in 2021. This result was mainly attributable to an increase in production costs and to the unit cost effect generated by a decrease in pounds of copper produced (-7.2%). Our cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues for 95 Table of Contents2022 was 16.5% above that seen for the same period of 2021 and was primarily driven by an increase in production costs and to the unit cost effect generated by a 7.2% decrease in pounds of copper produced . This result was partially offset by an increase in the by-product revenue credits.​Please see Management´s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Matters, Operating Cash Costs on the 2021 Form 10-K for details on variations between 2021 and 2020.​Metal Prices: The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, especially for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver.​We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices. For instance, during the period from January 2013 through December 2022, the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement price varied from a low of $1.96 per pound in 2016 to a record high of $4.87 per pound in 2022, and the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of $4.30 per pound in 2015 to a high of $31.85 per pound in 2022. Metal prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, as described further in Item 1A Risk Factors. These factors, which affect each commodity to varying degrees, include international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and cost of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by producers and others and, to a lesser degree, inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes due to economic concerns and financial investments.​For 2023, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved; 2022 tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects relative to potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors indicate the following change in estimated annual net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Copper Molybdenum Zinc SilverChange in metal prices (per pound except silver—per ounce)​$ 0.10​$ 1.00​$ 0.10​$ 1.00Change in net earnings (in millions)​$ 117.7​$ 29.5​$ 21.2​$ 12.3​Business Segments: We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines and several industrial processing facilities.​Segment information is included in our review of “Results of Operations” in this item and also in Note 19 “Segment and Related Information” of the consolidated financial statements.​Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, exchange rate volatility has been high but has had a limited effect on our results. Please see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more detailed information.​Capital Investment Program: We made capital investments of $948.5 million in 2022 and $892.3 million in 2021. In general, the capital investments and projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments.​96 Table of ContentsThe table below contains information on our capital investments for the three years ended December 31, 2022 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Peruvian projects:​​​​​​​​​Toquepala expansion project​$ 6.6​$ 21.8​$ 5.1Quebrada Honda dam expansion​ 20.3​ 86.3​ 30.9Relocation of facilities at Toquepala​ 6.3​ 23.8​ 6.6Toquepala mine truck acquisition​ —​ —​ 9.7Fresh water pipeline replacement at Suches​ 10.6​ 6.2​ 14.3Tailings disposal—Quebrada Honda dam​ 1.5​ 0.8​ 0.4Ilo sulfuric acid plant N°1 modification​ —​ 0.2​ 2.0Building of the containment dike N°4 at Quebrada Santallana​​ 0.7​​ 6.5​​ 9.5Other projects​ 104.5​ 28.8​ 21.5Sub‑total projects​ 150.5​ 174.4​ 100.0Maintenance and replacement​ 196.3​ 150.6​ 109.4Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ 8.2​ (4.1)​ (14.4)Total Peruvian expenditures​ 355.0​ 320.9​ 195.0Mexican projects:​ ​​ ​​​​New Buenavista concentrator​ 15.0​ 18.9​ 68.3Buenavista Zinc project​​ 99.8​​ 126.1​​ 58.4Pilares Mine​​ 29.6​​ 30.9​​ 33.4Expansion of mine pit at Buenavista​ 11.3​ 24.6​ 23.9Lime plant - Sonora​​ 19.3​​ 30.7​​ 9.3Solutions system improvements of Tinajas​ 0.2​ 0.7​ 10.0Quebalix IV​ 6.7​ 2.8​ 0.1New tailing disposal deposit at Buenavista mine​ 27.3​ 59.7​ 27.0Over elevation of tailings deposit N° 7 at La Caridad mine​ 2.8​ 1.4​ 11.0Sonora River water restitution system in Moritas Basin​ —​ —​ —San Martin mine restoration​​ 1.6​​ 20.7​​ 21.1Other projects​ 169.8​ 59.2​ 17.9Sub‑total projects​ 383.4​ 375.7​ 280.4Maintenance and replacement​ 212.2​ 184.0​ 132.5Net change in capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid​ (2.1)​ 11.7​ (15.7)Total Mexican expenditures​ 593.5​ 571.4​ 397.2Total capital investments​$ 948.5​$ 892.3​$ 592.2​In 2023, we plan to invest $1,099.6 million in capital projects. In addition to our ongoing capital maintenance and replacement spending, our principal capital programs include the following:​Projects in Mexico:​Buenavista Zinc - Sonora: This project is located within the Buenavista deposit, where a new concentrator is being built. This facility has a production capacity of 100,000 tonnes of zinc and 20,000 tonnes of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study and the project has all the necessary permits. When operating, this facility will double the Company’s zinc production capacity and will provide more than 2,000 operational jobs. We expect to initiate operations in the second half of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we have invested most of the $416 million budget.​Pilares - Sonora: Located six kilometers from La Caridad, this project consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade (combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with 0.29% from La Caridad). The budget for Pilares is $159 million, most of which has already been invested. Pilares is currently operating and delivering copper mineral oxides to the SX-EW facilities of the Caridad operation. We expect to produce mineral for the Caridad concentrator at full capacity in the second quarter of 2023.97 Table of ContentsEl Pilar - Sonora: This low-capital intensity copper greenfield project is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tonnes of ore with an average copper grade of 0.249%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tonnes of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. The results from experimental pads in leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. The basic engineering study is finished and the Company continues developing the project and engage in onsite environmental activities. The SX-EW plant EPCM project has been awarded to a contractor and has started. We expect production to begin in 2024 and mine life is estimated at 13 years.​Lime plant - Sonora: As part of our cost improvement projects, we built a new lime plant with a production capacity of 600 metric tonnes per day, which will be the largest lime plant of Mexico. This facility will allow us to reduce to approximately 50% our current lime cost at our Mexican operations. The total budget for the plant is $65.5 million, of which we have invested $62.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The furnace of the plant started operations in the second quarter of 2022, complying with the performance tests.​Projects in Peru:​Quebrada Honda dam expansion – Tacna: This project aims to enlarge the main and lateral dams in Quebrada Honda and includes the relocation and repowered of some facilities due to dam growth and implementation of other facilities for water recovery, among other factors. As of December 31, 2022, the drainage works and removal of Eolic material for the main and lateral dam had been completed; complementary operational works are underway and expected to finish in the first quarter 2023. This project has a total budget of $174.4 million, of which we have invested $153.6 million as of December 31, 2022.​Tia Maria - Arequipa: This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tonnes of SX- EW copper cathodes per year. SX-EW facilities are the most environmentally friendly in the industry as they do not require a smelting process and therefore, do not release any emissions into the atmosphere.​The Company has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality-of-life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.​We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during Tia Maria’s construction phase. Additionally, from day one of our operations, we will generate significant contributions to revenues in the Arequipa region.​Tia Maria’s project budget is approximately $1.4 billion, of which $329.8 million had been invested as of December 31, 2022 (Property net book value is $294.4 million). ​Potential projects:​We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, strategic and operating fit, expected return on investment, required investment, estimated production, estimated cash-flow profile, social and environmental considerations, among other factors. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy and market conditions. ​El Arco - Baja California: This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves of over 1,230 million tonnes with an average ore grade of 0.40% and 141 million tonnes of leach 98 Table of Contentsmaterial with an average ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open-pit mine with a combined concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tonnes of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. The Company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine and industrial facilities and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permits. ​Los Chancas—Apurimac: This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tonnes of oxides with a copper content of 0.45% and 52 million tonnes of sulfides with a copper content of 0.59%. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tonnes of copper and 7,500 tonnes of molybdenum anually. The estimated capital investment is $2,600 million and the project is expected to be in operation in 2030. In 2022, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities and worked on the project´s environmental impact assessment.​As of December 31, 2022, part of the project´s land continued to be occupied by illegal miners, some of whom have irregularly registered their stakes in the ""Integral Registry of Mining Formalization"" (REINFO). The Company has filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies, which have annulled the claims of 70 illegal miners while five cases remain open.​Michiquillay Project—Cajamarca: In June 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. Michiquillay is a world class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2,288 million tonnes with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash-cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2032. Michiquillay will become one of Peru´s largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region; generate new jobs for the local communities; and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments.​In 2021, the Company signed Social Agreements with the Michiquillay and the Encañada Communities. In addition, on October 1, 2021, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the semi-detailed Environmental Impact Study for the project.​In 2022, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Encañada communities, the Company hired unskilled labor and paid for the use of surface land. In the last quarter of 2022, the Company informed the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines that it had begun exploration activities and initiated an assessment of existing mineral resources at depth. The Company will continue to make surface land payments in 2023 and plans to support social programs in both communities as it rolls out additional exploration activities.​The above information is based on estimates only. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate.​ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) ​Sustainability is at the core of our ESG strategy. We are committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to the Paris Agreement. In 2022 AMC, our holding corporation, adhered to the United Nations Global Compact, which is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. This step reaffirms our commitment to align our policies, strategies, and operations with the Compact’s Ten Principles, whose objective is to address issues in the realm of human rights, labor rights, the environment and anti-corruption. By aligning our efforts with the UN Global Compact, we can continue to contribute the progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement goals.​SCC is improving its ESG performance by adopting the industry’s best practices, which includes offering the investment community and other stakeholders transparent information about our sustainability efforts. Our progress on this front and others has been recognized by S&P Global, which included SCC in the new S&P/BVL Peru General ESG index in April 99 Table of Contents2022. This index is the first of its kind in the Peruvian market and recognizes a total of 17 companies that meet high standards for environmental, social and governance management. ​The Company´s on-going ESG improvements led S&P to upgrade its Sustainability Assessment from 61/100 points in 2021 to 69/100 in 2022 (13% YoY increase). These results put SCC among the top 8% of best performers in the mining sector and places the Company 50% above the average rating. This evolution has been driven by positive performance in areas such as cybersecurity, water management, operations closure, occupational health and safety, among others. These efforts have also led to our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability index for the MILA region’s successive assessments since 2019 and for the second consecutive year (beginning in 2021), we earned a place the S&P Global´s Sustainability Yearbook.​In line with the industry’s best practices, SCC’s Board of Directors approved the creation of a new Sustainability Committee chaired by an independent director. The purpose of this Committee is to support the Company’s Board of Directors in developing and monitoring its compliance with ongoing ESG commitments in the ambits of the environment; health; safety and wellbeing of people and communities; human rights; and corporate governance. This is a significant step in our pledge to create robust and strong ESG performance. The Sustainable Development Committee has been holding quarterly meetings and has reported significant progress in terms of our main performance indicators and in implementing recommendations to continue building our climate change strategy. ​As part of our efforts to follow best practices, we continue to certify our environmental and occupational health and safety management systems (ISO 140001 and ISO 45001). In 2022, our Santa Barbara and San Martin mines, the Maritime Terminal of Guaymas, our Metallurgical plant Complex in Sonora, the Zinc Electrolytic Refinery, and the Metallurgical Complex in Ilo obtained ISO 45001. This year, the following operations received ISO 14001 certification for environmental management systems: La Caridad Mine, the Lime Plant in Sonora, the Maritime Terminal of Guaymas, the Zinc Electrolytic Refinery, the Metallurgical Complex in Ilo, the Central Workshop, and the Charcas unit, which was the first of our underground mines to achieve this recognition. Our objective is to ensure that all of our mining operations are ISO 14001 and 45001 certified by the first quarter of 2023.​The open pit mine La Caridad and the Sonora Metallurgical Complex (smelter and refinery) received Copper Mark certification. Both units were assessed by an independent assurance system to demonstrate that SCC’s copper is produced responsibly and to highlight the Company’s contributions to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations in five main areas: business and human rights, community, working conditions, environment, and governance. SCC’s goal is to ensure that copper production at all our units meet The Copper Mark criteria. Additionally, La Caridad and the Metallurgical Complex received The Molybdenum Mark and The Zinc Mark respectively.​Our holding company, Grupo Mexico, has been expanding our sustainability policies, which can be reviewed at https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/Politicsds.aspx. In 2022, the Grupo Mexico Mining Division also published a Code of Conduct for Business Partners, which provides details on the standards that must be met when participating in the Company’s supply chain. The areas covered include: (i) ethics and integrity; (ii) human rights; (iii) labor practices; (iv) occupational health and safety; (v) community outreach; (vi) environment; (vii) product quality; and (viii) risk management.​To prevent serious incidents and minimize impacts in the case of occurrence, we are implementing a Critical Risk Registry, in line with the ICMM Health and Safety Critical Control Management Good Practice Guide and relative to twenty groups of environmental, health and safety operational risks. We are ensuring that the barriers and controls are measurable and auditable according to specific performance criteria, including a clear assignment of responsibilities at the execution, supervision and verification levels. These efforts include designing an internal digital tool to monitor operational risks at all our mining units.​In 2022, MAPFRE-Peru awarded our SCC Toquepala unit with an “Award for Safety Excellence in 2021,” in recognition of the effectiveness of the Comprehensive System for Occupational Safety and Health Management implemented at this mine and throughout the organization.​100 Table of ContentsThe Metallurgical Complex in Sonora, where we smelt and refine material mined from the region was recognized in the ranking of the 10 Best Places to Work for Women, positioning it as the “Employer of Choice” for the best professionals in the country.

All employees are aware of this fact and are expected to follow policies and procedures to ensure physical integrity and preserve our installations . Please consult Grupo Mexico Sustainability Report at https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/development.aspx to further information on SCC’s performance with regard to health and safety.​In 2022, the Mexican Government awarded our Caridad metallurgical operation, the distinction of “Safe and Healthy Workplace” for implementing improvements on safety, health and wellbeing of our workers while bolstering the productivity and quality of the workplace. Our precious metals plant, which is part of the La Caridad complex, received the Casco de Plata (Silver Helmet) in the category “Smelters with less than 500 workers,” which was awarded by the Mining Chamber of Mexico in recognition of our ranking as the best performing plant on the occupational accident index for 2021.​In the framework of the XVI National Competition of Underground Mining Rescues, First Aid and Hazardous materials, the Mining Chamber of Commerce of Mexico (CAMIMEX) and the National Council to Regulate and Certify Workplace Practices (CONOCER) awarded first place to the rescue squads of the Charcas and Santa Barbara units in the categories “Underground Mining Rescue” and “First Aid”.​ENVIRONMENT​Southern Copper Corporation aims to fulfill to the needs of future generations by promoting development that benefits all, both today and down the line. We are committed to continuously improving our environmental performance and to promoting the adoption of the best environmental practices at our operations to contribute to the transition to a green economy. To this end we have made a significant progress in certifying our operations environmental management systems in ISO 14001. We are also committed to preserving and improving the environment by implementing actions to generate a positive impact on biodiversity through our operations. To fulfil this commitment, which is outlined in the Company’s Environmental Policy, we have developed action plans for biodiversity management that are aligned with the guide for Good Practice Guidance for Mining and Biodiversity published by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). We believe these plans further improve the Company’s capacity to implement effective mitigation measures and contribute to the preservation and improvement of the environment at our operations.​Regarding our environmental risk management, we are aligning our tailings systems to the recently published ICMM's (International Council on Mining and Metals) Global Standard on Tailings Management and have improved our governance framework by implementing a brand-new Internal Committee for Review of Tailings Systems to bolster safety management and communication between operations and top management.​To reduce our dependency on underground water, the Company is working to identify new sources of water to use in its processes, including recycling wastewater from urban areas. This constitutes a win-win scenario that generates sanitation solution for urban areas while reducing competition for water.​COMMUNITY OUTREACH ​Southern Copper Corporation prioritizes being a good neighbor in the localities close to our operations. Working together with the communities, we have the opportunity to collaborate and forge a path based on common objectives for social and 101 Table of Contentseconomic development as we work to support the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. We believe that community outreach must be based on transparency and trust and strive to promote long-lasting ties.​Our Community Development model has three components: 1) responsible coexistence: to foster a positive and healthy coexistence with our neighbor communities, and to have open and ongoing channels of communication to address complaints and concerns; 2) economic development: it is important to share the economic value our operations generate with the community, and 3) human development: to optimize the skills of members of the communities where we work, to ensure that these individuals become the principal drivers of development in their communities.​Our grievance mechanism for external stakeholders (Community Attention Service) operates at 100% of our sites. We have an institutional program that supports the development of small and medium mining suppliers in Mexico and Peru.​In the first quarter of 2022, we completed construction at the Cularjahuira dam in the province of Candarave, which borders our Toquepala mine. This facility will store up to 2.55 million cubic meters of water to irrigate 500 hectares of agricultural land and will directly benefit 585 families of local farmers. The Prime Minister joined us for the inauguration of this dam ($11.5 million), which was the fruit of joint investment between the Company, government authorities and the highland community of Camilaca. This project will help strengthen agricultural activities in the province of Candarave (near our Toquepala operations) and will be complemented by work on a new Callazas dam ($35 million), which SCC hopes to finance through the “Social Investment for Taxes” (obras por impuestos) mechanism. These efforts are evolving in a context marked by record-highs for the Company’s tax contributions to the regional governments of Moquegua and Tacna in 2021.​To adequately use and preserve water resources, we have begun building a wastewater treatment plant in the province of Ilo, in Moquegua, Peru. This project will require an investment of approximately $27 million and will benefit more than 77,000 people. SCC will operate and maintain the plant for the next 30 years to prevent wastewater from being discharged into the ocean, which will protect the marine ecosystem and public health.​More than 300 outstanding students will benefit from the construction of modern infrastructure for the High-Performance School of Moquegua (Colegio de Alto Rendimiento de Moquegua−COAR), which SCC will build through the Taxes for Works mechanism, in conjunction with the Ministry of Education (MINEDU). At a well-attended ceremony, the project’s first stone was laid. The facility will be completed over a period of 18 months and will require an investment of approximately $25 million.​In the framework of the 14th International Mining Congress, which was held in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, the Association of Mining Engineers, Metallurgists and Geologists of Mexico A.C. (Asociación de Ingenieros de Minas, Metalurgistas y Geólogos de México A.C.) bestowed Grupo México, the holding company of AMC, with an award in recognition of the corporation’s efforts to generate more social impact in this state of the Mexican Republic.​On a social responsibility front, Fundación Grupo México organized a Volunteer Day, which was attended by 8,000 volunteers in 13 states of Mexico and five regions of Peru. Efforts benefited more than 40 institutions near our operations with a focus on improving the quality of life at the community, family, and environment levels.​For additional information on our community programs, refer to Corporate Social Responsibility under Note 13 “Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements. For further information on our disclosure on Human Capital Resources, see the section included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.​​CLIMATE CHANGE​SCC recognizes the importance and urgency of tackling climate change, and the Company is committed to support the objective of the Paris Agreement on climate change, preserve the environment, minimize the environmental footprint of our operations, and efficiently manage climate-related risks and opportunities. We recognize that climate change will likely influence our strategy in various ways, and we aim to meet the expectations of the global business trends that are moving to demand products with lower carbon footprint. Our focus is to seek continuous improvement in the responsible use of 102 Table of Contentsnatural resources while complying with applicable legal standards for prevention, mitigation, control and remediation of environmental impacts. ​The Company is committed to continually improve its management performance with respect to the aforementioned issues, which is why it has initiated a multi-year process to align its disclosures on climate change with the TCFD recommendations. As a result beginning in 2020, Grupo Mexico’s Sustainable Development Report includes sections on climate-related risks and opportunities, and more detailed information on new short, medium and long term climate targets, strategy and governance mechanisms, will be published in our holding 2022 Sustainability Development Report, as well as new emissions and energy metrics informed by SASB standards. The report can be accessed at https://www.gmexico.com/en/Pages/development.aspx. We are referring our investors to Grupo Mexico's internet site for details on the aforementioned initiatives for informative purposes only. We do not intend for this internet link to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this Report on Form 10-K.​Since 2016, Grupo Mexico has been participating annually in the evaluation on Climate Change of CDP1 and in 2022 for the first time in the evaluation of Water Security. In both questionnaires we achieved “B” result (third best score on a scale of eight levels), which is one level above the mining sector average score and the North America region overall score. ​Additionally, given the importance of water for our operations and in the broader perspective of climate change, the Company appointed a Water Resources Director at the executive level. His main function will be to coordinate the actions needed to promote water management at all our operations and ensure our place as a responsible partner in the regional management of this valuable resource.​Related to climate change, we actively continue collaborating with the International Copper Association (ICA) to define the Global Copper Decarbonization Roadmap, which is aligned with the Paris Agreement. The results of this exercise have nurtured our medium and long-term objectives and will be published in the first quarter of 2023, along with our holding’s Sustainability Development Report.​HUMAN RIGHTS​At Grupo Mexico we are committed to enforcing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We have a series of policies and procedures that serve as a guide to all employees and suppliers: General Human Rights Policy; Policy of Respect for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Communities; Diversity, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination, No Workplace or Sexual Harassment Policy; and the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, Contractors and Relevant Business Partners, which includes several sections related to human rights. ​The company has a human rights’ due diligence process in place to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate adverse impacts on the human rights of communities. In the Mining and Infrastructure divisions, it has three main components: 1)Participatory Social Diagnosis to allow the communities to voice their concerns regarding human rights, 2) Social Management Plans that define actions to address those concerns, and 3)the Community Care Service (SAC), a tool that was designed with the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mexico Office and allows the community to immediately communicate its concerns to the Company. ​Grupo Mexico also has a human rights’ due diligence process in place to protect the rights of employees (both the Company’s and those of contractors). The work climate surveys, Complaint Hotline and the due diligence of suppliers are tools that enable the company to comply with the commitments included in the General Human Rights Policy. We are currently implementing a Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, which focuses primarily on training; revision of recruitment processes; and physical changes to working areas.​​1 CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts. It constitutes the main global reference for environmental reporting standards. 103 Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.​Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: mineral reserves, revenue recognition, ore stockpiles on leach pads and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, determination of discount rates related to the operating lease liabilities, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.​Mineral Reserves: For ore reserve estimation, we use metal price assumptions of $3.30 per pound for copper and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum. These prices are intended to conservatively approximate average prices over the long term and are based on internal estimates for the curves of long-term metal prices.​Certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices. These include amortization of intangible assets and mine development. Variations in ore reserve calculations from changes in metal price assumptions generally do not create material changes in our financial results. However, significant decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our earnings by causing, among other things, asset impairment charges, please see “Assets impairment” below. ​Ore stockpiles on leach pads: The leaching process is an integral part of the mining operations carried out at our open-pit mines. We capitalize the production cost of leachable material at our Toquepala, La Caridad and Buenavista mines recognizing it as inventory. The estimates of recoverable mineral content contained in the leaching dumps are supported by engineering studies. As the production cycle of the leaching process is significantly longer than the conventional process of concentrating, smelting and electrolytic refining, we include current leach inventory (as part of work-in-process inventories) and long-term leach inventory on our balance sheet. Amortization of leachable material is recorded by the units of production method.​The capitalization of long-term inventory-Ore stockpiles in leach pads is based on the allocation of copper content recoverable between ore and leach material. In addition, inventory consumption is valued at the average unit cost.​Asset Retirement Obligation: Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. ​In 2020, the Company made a change in the estimate for the asset retirement obligation for its Mexican operations, mainly due to a detailed review of the closing activities required for each facility. The effect of this change was an increase in the asset retirement obligation of $269.3 million, which was recorded in December 2020. 104 Table of ContentsIn 2022, after a detailed review of their closing activities, the Company recorded an adjustment in its asset retirement obligation provision of $43.3 million for Mexico and a $59.5 million for Peru.​Asset retirement obligations are further discussed in Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” to the consolidated financial statements included herein.​Revenue Recognition: For certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products, customer contracts allow for pricing based on a month subsequent to shipping, in most cases within the following three months and in a few cases, in a period that can exceed three months. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment. The provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward LME or COMEX copper prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. In the case of molybdenum sales, for which there are no published forward prices, the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract. (See details in “Provisionally Priced Sales” under this Item 7).​Income Taxes: In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we calculate the actual amount currently payable or receivable, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted.​A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.​The Company’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties can arise in the application of complex tax regulations. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including audits and negotiations with tax authorities. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, final taxes paid may be materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If its estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, or payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be more than the recorded amounts, the difference would be recognized in the period when the Company determines the change.​Asset Impairments: We evaluate our long-term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle. We are currently using an average copper price of $2.20 per pound and an average molybdenum price of $5.00 per pound, which reflect what we believe, for impairment test purposes, is the lower range of the current price environment. The results of our impairment sensitivity analysis, which included a stress test using a copper price assumption of $2.00 per pound and a molybdenum price assumption of $4.00 per pound, showed projected discounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets by margins ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 times such carrying amount.​We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment compared to fair value.​105 Table of ContentsLeases: In 2019, the Company adopted the new leases standard and it resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations on the Company´s balance sheet. After the analysis of this standard, the Company concluded that all of its existing lease contracts are operating lease contracts. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation by the Company to make lease payments that arise from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the inception date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease contracts do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the inception date to determine the present value of lease payments.​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table highlights key financial results for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​​​Variance​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Statement of Earnings Data​2022 2021 2020​2022 - 2021 2021 - 2020Net sales​$ 10,047.9​$ 10,934.1​$ 7,984.9​$ (886.2)​$ 2,949.2Operating costs and expenses​ (5,612.1)​ (4,869.0)​ (4,864.2)​ (743.1)​ (4.8)Operating income​ 4,435.8​ 6,065.1​ 3,120.7​ (1,629.3)​ 2,944.4Non‑operating income (expense)​ (188.0)​ (368.3)​ (374.9)​ 180.3​ 6.6Income before income taxes​ 4,247.8​ 5,696.8​ 2,745.8​ (1,449.0)​ 2,951.0Income taxes​ (1,477.5)​ (2,425.5)​ (1,237.9)​ 948.0​ (1,187.6)Deferred income taxes​ (118.6)​ 126.3​ 63.5​ (244.9)​ 62.8Equity earnings of affiliate​ (3.7)​ 13.6​ 6.4​ (17.3)​ 7.2Net income attributable to non‑controlling interest​ (9.5)​ (14.1)​ (7.4)​ 4.6​ (6.7)Net income attributable to SCC​$ 2,638.5​$ 3,397.1​$ 1,570.4​$ (758.6)​$ 1,826.7​NET SALES​2022-2021: Net sales in 2022 were $10,047.9, compared to $10,934.1 million in 2021, which represented a decrease of $886.2 million. This 8.1% reduction was driven primarily by a decrease in sales volume for copper (-6.5%), silver (-1.9%) and molybdenum (-13.4%) due to a lower production, and secondarily by a drop in prices for copper (-5.4%) and silver (-13.6%). The aforementioned was partially offset by an increase in sales volume for zinc (+10.5%) and by an uptick in prices for molybdenum (+20.0%) and zinc (+16.2%).​Please see Management´s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Operations on the 2021 Form 10-K for details on variations between 2021 and 2020.​The table below outlines the average published market metals prices for our metals for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ % Variance ​​2022 2021 2020 2022 - 20212021 - 2020Copper price ($per pound—LME)​$ 4.00​$ 4.23​$ 2.80​ (5.4)% 51.1%Copper price ($per pound—COMEX)​$ 4.01​$ 4.24​$ 2.80​ (5.4)% 51.4%Molybdenum price ($per pound)(1)​$ 18.61​$ 15.51​$ 8.57​ 20.0% 81.0%Zinc price ($per pound—LME)​$ 1.58​$ 1.36​$ 1.03​ 16.2% 32.0%Silver price ($per ounce—COMEX)​$ 21.76​$ 25.18​$ 20.62​ (13.6)% 22.1%(1)Platt’s Metals Week Dealer Oxide.​106 Table of ContentsThe table below provides our metal sales as a percentage of our total net sales:​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended ​​December 31, ​Sales as a percentage of total net sales 2022 2021​2020​Copper 75.0% 80.7% 81.6%Molybdenum 11.9% 9.6% 6.4%Silver 4.0% 4.3% 5.6%Zinc 3.7% 2.7% 3.1%Other by‑products 5.4% 2.7% 3.3%Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%​The table below provides our copper sales by type of product (in million pounds).

For information regarding our capital expenditure programs, please see the discussion under the caption “Capital Investment Program” under this Item 7.​CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS​As of December 31, 2022, our most significant contractual obligations include interest and principal on debt, workers’ participation, pension and post-retirement obligations, payments for operating leases, asset retirement obligations, and commitments for purchasing energy and for capital investment projects.​Interest on debt is calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2022. As all our debt is at fixed rates, future expenditures will not change due to rate changes. Please refer to Note 11 “Financing” of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term debt arrangements and credit facilities.​Workers’ participation is currently calculated based on Peruvian Branch and Mexican pre-tax earnings. In Peru, the provision for workers’ participation is calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings. The current portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on the Peruvian Branch’s taxable income and is largely distributed to workers after final results are determined for the year. Amounts in excess of 18 times a worker’s salary are distributed to governmental bodies. In Mexico, workers’ participation is determined using the guidelines established in the Mexican income tax law at a rate of 10% of pre-tax earnings as adjusted by the tax law.​Operating leases include lease payments for power generating facilities to MGE, vehicles and properties. Please refer to Note 9 “Leases” of the consolidated financial statements.​Pension and post retirement obligations include the benefits expected to be paid under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Please refer to Note 12 “Benefit Plans” of the consolidated financial statements.​Asset retirement obligations include the aggregate amount of closure and remediation costs for our Peruvian mines and facilities to be paid under the mine closure plans approved by MINEM and the closure and remediation costs of our Mexican operations. See Note 10 “Asset Retirement Obligation” of the consolidated financial statements.​In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (“MW”) with the state company Electroperu S.A., which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa Generacion S.A. (“Kallpa”), which began supplying energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017. In May 2016, we signed an additional power purchase agreement for a maximum of 80MW with Kallpa, under which Kallpa will supply energy to the operations related to the Toquepala Expansion and to other minor projects for ten years starting on May 1, 2017 and ending after ten years of commercial operation of the Toquepala Expansion or on April 30, 2029; whichever occurs first.Additionally, we have a commitment to purchase power for our Mexican operations from MGE, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico through 2032. See Note 13 “Commitment and Contingencies—Other commitments”.​Our long-term estimated power costs are subject to change as energy generation costs change and our forecasted power requirements through the life of the agreements change. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has committed approximately $405.5 million for the development of its capital investment projects. These include committed purchase orders and executed contracts for our Mexican projects and for our Peruvian expansion projects.​CYBERSECURITY​Innovation and the development of our technological capabilities have been and will continue to be actively present in our operations and in our day-to-day business management. In the global context, rapid deployment and adoption of new technologies and tools have challenged management models and heightened the need to manage the risks inherent to integrating new technologies within infrastructure and governance models and at the heart of our organization’s skill set and culture.​116 Table of ContentsSCC is committed to executing the Information Security Strategy launched in 2021, and worked in 2022 to ensure the continuity of the strategic lines based on: improving our technology through cybersecurity projects; adapting our process model to bolster our corporate governance framework and organizational culture; and increasing our employees’ awareness of security issues by strengthening communication. Members and management and working groups joined forces to advance the execution of our strategy through interdisciplinary projects.​Going forward, the main strategic lines to execute our Information Security Strategy will be guided by our holistic vision and include: awareness campaigns and training for our personnel; implementation of technological, operational and security risk management methodologies; enhancing our governance framework, policies and procedures; strengthening our cybersecurity architecture; developing, monitoring, evaluating and verifying our protection, continuity and recovery schemes; developing management tools to ensure that our operations comply with requirements to protect privacy; and incorporating testing, verification and simulation mechanisms for the controls that regulate our model.​We believe that our business model is in the process integrating information. As such, the focus is on identifying and managing the risks to which our organization is exposed. It is important to note that these risks are on the rise and evolving. To support and evolve our strategy and maintain the effectiveness of our architecture and operating models, we constantly measure, assess and improve all aspects relative to information security. We stand at the ready to agilely and adeptly respond to all scenarios.​117 Table of ContentsNON-GAAP INFORMATION RECONCILIATION​Operating cash cost: Following is a reconciliation of “Operating Cash Cost” (see page 95) to cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, in millions of dollars and dollars per pound in the table below:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022 2021 2020​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundCost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion)​$ 4,649.1​$ 2.45​$ 3,894.4​$ 1.90​$ 3,929.8​$ 1.84Add:​ ​ ​​ ​ ​​ ​ ​Selling, general and administrative​ 125.0​ 0.07​ 125.2​ 0.06​ 126.2​ 0.06Sales premiums, net of treatment and refining charges​ (21.0)​​ (0.01)​ (25.6)​ (0.01)​ 17.00​ 0.01Less:​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Workers’ participation​ (282.9)​​ (0.15)​ (267.2)​ (0.13)​ (263.9)​ (0.13)Cost of metals purchased from third parties​ (316.8)​​ (0.17)​ (225.8)​ (0.11)​ (495.2)​ (0.23)Royalty charge and other, net​ (300.9)​​ (0.16)​ (158.6)​ (0.08)​ (171.6)​ (0.08)Inventory change​ (26.8)​​ (0.01)​ 15.0​ 0.01​ (218.6)​ (0.10)Operating Cash Cost before by‑product revenues​$ 3,825.7​$ 2.02​$ 3,357.4​$ 1.64​$ 2,923.7​$ 1.37Add:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ By‑product revenues(1)​ (2,327.2)​ (1.22)​ (1,974.8)​ (0.96)​ (1,375.9)​ (0.64)Net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties​ (28.6)​​ (0.02)​ (22.9)​ (0.01)​ (80.0)​ (0.04)Total by‑product revenues​ (2,355.8)​ (1.24)​ (1,997.7)​ (0.97)​ (1,455.9)​ (0.68)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating Cash Cost net of by‑product revenues​ 1,469.9​ 0.78​ 1,359.7​ 0.67​ 1,467.8​ 0.69​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total pounds of copper produced (in millions)​ 1,894.7​ ​ 2,041.7​ ​ 2,136.1​ (1)By-product revenues included in our presentation of operating cash cost contain the following:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022 2021 2020​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ $ per ​​ $ per ​​ $ per​​$ millions​pound​$ millions​pound​$ millions​poundMolybdenum​$ (1,192.7)​$ (0.63)​$ (1,053.1)​$ (0.51)​$ (510.3)​$ (0.24)Silver​ (370.5)​ (0.20)​ (445.3)​ (0.22)​ (415.5)​ (0.19)Zinc​ (242.9)​ (0.13)​ (196.9)​ (0.10)​ (202.9)​ (0.10)Sulfuric Acid​ (395.8)​ (0.21)​ (164.6)​ (0.08)​ (135.9)​ (0.06)Gold​ (81.0)​ (0.04)​ (67.5)​ (0.03)​ (73.6)​ (0.03)Other​ (44.3)​ (0.01)​ (47.4)​ (0.02)​ (37.7)​ (0.02)Total​$ (2,327.2)​$ (1.22)​$ (1,974.8)​$ (0.96)​$ (1,375.9)​$ (0.64)​The by-product revenue presented does not match with the sales value reported by segment on page 173 because the above table excludes purchases from third parties, which are reclassified to net revenue on sale of metal purchased from third parties.​118 Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK​Commodity price risk:For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to “Metal Prices” in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report.​Open sales risk:Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper or molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings in each period prior to settlement. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales.​Foreign currency exchange rate risk:Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Given that our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances for the three years ended December 31, 2022 are provided in the table below:​​​​​​​​​ Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2022 2021 2020​Peru: ​Peruvian inflation rate 8.5% 6.4% 2.0%​​​​​​​​Initial exchange rate 3.998 3.624 3.317​Closing exchange rate 3.820 3.998 3.624​Appreciation/(devaluation) 4.5% (10.3)% (9.3)%​​​​​​​​Mexico: ​Mexican inflation rate 7.8% 7.4% 3.2%​​​​​​​​Initial exchange rate 20.584 19.949 18.845​Closing exchange rate 19.362 20.584 19.949​Appreciation/(devaluation) 5.9% (3.2)% (5.9)%​Change in monetary position:​Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10% at December 31, 2022, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows:​​​​​ Effect in net​ earnings​ ($ in millions)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ 14.9Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol​$ (18.2)Appreciation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ (19.0)Devaluation of 10% in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso​$ 23.2​The net monetary position is net of those assets and liabilities that are sol or peso denominated as of December 31, 2022.​Short-term investments:​For additional information on our trading securities and available-for-sale investments, refer to Note 3 Short-term Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.119 Table of ContentsDerivative Instruments:​From time to time, we use derivative instruments to manage our cash flows exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate that the possibility exists that future activity will expose our future cash flows to deterioration. Derivative contracts for commodities are entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of the commodities that we use in our manufacturing process.​Cash Flow Hedges of Natural Gas​The Company’s objective in using natural gas derivatives is to protect the stability of natural gas costs and manage exposure to natural gas price increases. To protect natural gas costs from estimated price increases in the past winter season, in the third quarter of 2021, the Company acquired two derivative instruments that began in November 2021 and ended in March 2022.​We assessed these derivative instruments as Cash Flow Hedges. As such, the effective portions of said hedges were initially reported in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and were reclassified as earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company did not identify any ineffective portions of these derivatives. ​As of December 31, 2022, we held no derivative instruments.​​120 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:05.888993
